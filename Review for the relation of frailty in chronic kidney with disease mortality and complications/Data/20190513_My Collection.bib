abstract = {Falls and mineral and bones disorders are both implicated in the occurrence of pathological fractures in patients undergoing chronic dialysis. However, data on falls among this population are rare. We carried out a prospective study during four weeks and included 70 patients on chronic hemodialysis with the main objectives being to evaluate the incidence of falls and factors related to it. At the end of the four weeks, 16 patients (22.86{\%}) fell at least once, with a total of 17 falls during 4 weeks, giving an incidence of 3.2 falls per patient/year. The mean age was 40 +/- 16 years. Five patients (31.2{\%}) had a past history of pathological fractures. Ten patients (62.5{\%}) presented intra- and post-dialysis hypotension, six (37.5{\%}) was diagnosed of gait disorders and two (12.5{\%}) had sensory deficit of the lower limbs. Six patients (37.5{\%}) presented frailty. Hypotension (P=0.004), frailty (P=0.047) and sensory deficit (P=0.049) were significantly associated with the occurrence of falls. The incidence of falls is relatively high in our hemodialysis patients and real risk factors exist. Hence, it is important to implement programs for falls prevention to reduce their incidence and impact.},

abstract = {A new category of patients aged {\textgreater}75 yrs, namely the elderly, is now being freely  admitted to hemodialysis (HD) and this category is becoming predominant. The absence of systematic studies makes this patient category almost indistinguishable from other categories, even though its peculiarity is now evident. At least 30-40{\%} of individuals in this age bracket are expected to be dependent and/or frail, but the incidence of frailty is likely to be higher in the elderly undergoing HD. Due to severe physical and/or mental impairment and often because of strong social hardships, these patients rarely experience clinical stability and are dependent on third parties for their survival. Their care produces complex problems for welfare services and this has proved responsible for modifying the organization of renal care units. These repeated patient admissions to hospital are filling nephrology facilities, and the dialysis management -- mainly concerning outpatients -- requires a much greater use of facilities and staff than normal if compared to average dialysis patients. In 112 elderly patients consecutively admitted to the dialysis program over a period of 10 yrs, we identified 35 dependent or frail patients (31.2{\%}), even taking into consideration only extreme degrees of infirmity. Dependence proved to be the only clinical parameter associated with survival (mortality at 6 months 23.6 vs. 10.6{\%}, p{\textless}0.01; Kaplan-Meier survival curves, p{\textless}0.03 log-rank test), while comorbidities -- in particular cardiovascular -- that usually affect dialysis mortality rates, did not seem to be discriminating risk factors in the elderly. More precisely, with the confirmation of these data through wider case studies, the idea will be reinforced that, also in dialysis, the elderly must be constantly monitored for dependence and frailty, as is the case in any exclusively geriatric field. Prevention, as well as a therapeutic approach specifically modeled on these conditions, could help to improve the prognosis of this patient category, which is particularly difficult to deal with and is becoming predominant in dialysis units.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING {\&} PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) {\textless}90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy. MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was 51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0{\%}) was twice that of the much older non-CKD reference population (P {\textless}0.01). The most common frailty components were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes, eGFR(cys) categories of {\textless}30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a 2.8- (95{\%} CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of frailty compared with GFR(cys) {\textgreater}/=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was associated with an estimated 2.5 (95{\%} CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or dialysis therapy. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal relationships between CKD and frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.},

abstract = {The relationship between frailty and chronic kidney disease in elderly population has been recognized; however, studies concentrating on frailty in predialysis patients are limited. For nephrologists, the recognition of frailty is important as it has impact on decisions on the choice of dialysis modality and sometimes on whether dialysis is indeed in the patients' best interests. Many of the tools for routine assessment of frailty are not easily applicable to those clinicians not practicing elderly care medicine. A tool needs to be simple and applicable for daily routine practice. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical outcome of frailty in an elderly predialysis population using simple tools. A nonrandomized prospective study was conducted in which, 104 patients aged 65 years or above with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25 mL or less were included. Data including age, sex, renal function, calcium, albumin, parathormone, and comorbidities were collected at baseline and at three months interval for one year. Functional performance was assessed using Karnofsky scale. The Charlson comorbidity index was used to assess comorbid status of each patient. Frailty was assessed using a combination of PRISMA questionnaire and Timed up and Go test. End points were death or start of dialysis at 20-month follow-up. A frail group (n = 58; males = 32, females = 26) and a nonfrail group (n = 46; males = 21, females = 25) were identified. Frailty was prevalent in 53.8{\%} of the selected population. There was no significant difference between both groups in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, hemoglobin, inflammatory markers, or calcium hemostasis. Nine patients chose conservative management in the frail group and six in nonfrail group. Rate of death was significantly higher in the frail group (death = 14) compared to nonfrail group (death = 3; P = 0.01). There was no significant difference between both groups in terms of initiation of dialysis (P = 0.1). Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index were significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.023 and 0.032, respectively). Survival in frail patients who started peritoneal dialysis (PD) was slightly better than those started on hemodialysis (HD) with hazard ratio = 3.23 (P = 0.23). Our study shows that the prevalence of frailty and mortality rate is high among elderly predialysis patients. Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index are independent predictors of outcome in this population. PD might be a better option of dialysis modality compared to HD in the frail population.},

abstract = {Frailty is significantly associated with bone loss in the general population. However, it is unclear whether this association also exists in patients undergoing hemodialysis who have chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). This study aimed to assess the association between frailty and bone loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This cross-sectional study included 214 (90 women, 124 men) Japanese outpatients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis three times per week, with a mean age of 67.1 years (women) and 66.8 years (men). Frailty was defined based on criteria set forth by the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)-19 (21.1{\%}) women and 47 (37.9{\%}) men were robust, 41 (45.6{\%}) women and 43 (34.7{\%}) men were pre-frail, and 30 (33.3{\%}) women and 34 (27.4{\%}) men were frail. For bone mass, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters (speed of sound, broadband ultrasound attenuation, stiffness index) of the calcaneus were measured. The association between frailty and QUS parameters was determined separately for women and men using multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with adjustments for clinical characteristics including age, body mass index, hemodialysis vintage, diabetes, current smoking, serum albumin, phosphate, corrected calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, and medication for CKD-MBD (vitamin D receptor activator, calcimimetics). ANCOVA revealed that all QUS parameters declined significantly with increasing levels of frailty in both sexes (P {\textless} 0.05). In conclusion, frailty (as defined by CHS criteria) should be considered a risk factor for bone loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Although sarcopenia is thought to underlie the manifestations of frailty, association of frailty with measures of body composition is underinvestigated. METHODS: Eighty hemodialysis patients were included in the study. Performance-based frailty (PbF) used gait speed over 20 feet and 5 sit-to-stand (1 point each for lowest quintile) for the physical components of the frailty phenotype plus exhaustion (Short Form-36 [SF-36] vitality score {\textless}55) and physical activity (lowest quintile of weekly kcal energy expenditure on leisure activity on the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly questionnaire; 1 point). Function-based frailty (FbF) defined by questionnaire measures of physical functioning (SF-36 Physical Function score {\textless}75; 1 point), exhaustion, and physical activity as for PbF. A score of 2 or greater was defined as frail. Outcomes related to muscle size included muscle area of the contractile tissue of the anterior tibialis and quadriceps muscles using magnetic resonance imaging, phase angle using bioimpedance analysis, lean body mass using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and body mass index (BMI). Linear regression was used to analyze associations between frailty and muscle size, with and without sex and age covariates. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of individuals met PbF criteria, 63{\%} met FbF criteria, and 55{\%} met both. In univariate analysis, PbF and FbF were associated with smaller muscle area of the quadriceps, smaller phase angle, and higher BMI. Associations remained significant for the quadriceps after adjustment for age and sex. The magnitude of association of PbF with quadriceps muscle area was greater than 10 years of age (-30.3 cm(2)P = .02 vs. -6.6 cm(2)P {\textless} .0001) in multivariate analysis. There was no significant association between either measure of frailty and other measures of body composition after adjustment for age and sex.

DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, {\&} MEASUREMENTS: We examined the predictive ability of frailty on the basis of physical performance and self-reported function in participants of a US Renal Data System special study that enrolled a convenience sample of 771 prevalent patients on hemodialysis from 14 facilities in the Atlanta and northern California areas from 2009 to 2011. Performance-based frailty was assessed using direct measures of grip strength (weakness) and gait speed along with weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity; poor self-reported function was substituted for weakness and slow gait speed in the self-reported function-based definition. For both definitions, patients meeting three or more criteria were considered frail. RESULTS: The mean age of 762 patients included in analyses was 57.1+/-14.2 years old; 240 patients (31{\%}) met the physical performance-based definition of frailty, and 396 (52{\%}) met the self-reported function-based definition. There were 106 deaths during 1.7 (interquartile range, 1.4-2.4) years of follow-up. After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality for the performance-based definition (2.16; 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], 1.41 to 3.29) was slightly higher than that of the self-reported function-based definition (HR, 1.93; 95{\%} CI, 1.24 to 3.00). Patients who met the self-report-based definition but not the physical performance definition of frailty (n=192) were not at statistically significantly higher risk of mortality than those who were not frail by either definition (n=330; HR, 1.41; 95{\%} CI, 0.81 to 2.45), but those who met both definitions of frailty (n=204) were at significantly higher risk (HR, 2.46; 95{\%} CI, 1.51 to 4.01).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although frailty has been linked to higher risk of falls and fracture in the general population, only few studies have examined the extent to which frailty is associated with these outcomes among patients with end-stage renal disease, who are at particularly high risk for these events. METHODS: A total of 1,646 patients who were beginning maintenance hemodialysis in 297 dialysis units throughout the United States from September 2005 to June 2007 were enrolled in the Comprehensive Dialysis Study, and 1,053 Medicare beneficiaries were included in this study. Self-reported frailty was defined by the patients endorsing 2 or more of the following: poor physical functioning, exhaustion or low physical activity. Falls and fractures requiring medical attention were identified through Medicare claims data. We examined the association between frailty and the time to first fall or fracture using the Fine-Gray modification of Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for demographics, Quetelet's body mass index, diabetes mellitus, heart failure and atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of patients were frail by self-report. The median length of follow-up was 2.5 (1.0-3.9) years. Crude rates of first medically urgent falls or fractures were 66 and 126 per 1,000 person-years in non-frail and self-reported frail participants, respectively. After accounting for demographic factors, comorbidities and the competing risk of death, self-reported frailty was associated with a higher risk of falls or fractures requiring medical attention (hazards ratio 1.60, 95{\%} CI 1.16-2.20). CONCLUSION: Participants reporting frailty experienced nearly twice the risk of medically urgent falls or fractures compared to those who did not report frailty.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Physical activity questionnaires usually focus on moderate to vigorous activities and may not accurately capture physical activity or variation in levels of activity among extremely inactive groups like dialysis patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Three dialysis facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area. SUBJECTS: Sixty-eight prevalent hemodialysis patients. INTERVENTION: We administered a new physical activity questionnaire designed to capture activity in the lower end of the range, the Low Physical Activity Questionnaire (LoPAQ). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Outcome measures were correlation with a validated physical activity questionnaire, the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity (LTA) questionnaire and with self-reported physical function (physical function score of the SF-36) and physical performance (gait speed, chair stand, balance, and short physical performance battery). We also determined whether patients who were frail or reported limitations in activities of daily living were less active on the LoPAQ. RESULTS: Sixty-eight participants (mean age 59 +/- 14 years, 59{\%} men) completed the study. Patients were inactive according to the LoPAQ, with a median (interquartile range) of 517 (204-1190) kcal/week of physical activity. Although activity from the LTA was lower than on the LoPAQ (411 [61-902] kcal/week), the difference was not statistically significant (P = .20), and results from the 2 instruments were strongly correlated (rho = 0.62, P {\textless} .001). In addition, higher physical activity measured by the LoPAQ was correlated with better self-reported functioning (rho = 0.64, P {\textless} .001), better performance on gait speed (rho = 0.32, P = .02), balance (rho = 0.45, P {\textless} .001), and chair rising (rho = -0.32, P = .03) tests and with higher short physical performance battery total score (rho = 0.51, P {\textless} .001). Frail patients and patients with activities of daily living limitations were less active than those who were not frail or limited. CONCLUSIONS: The LoPAQ performed similarly to the Minnesota LTA questionnaire in our cohort despite being shorter and easier to administer.},

abstract = {Background: Kidney transplantation (KT) candidates often present with multiple comorbidities. These patients also have a substantial burden of frailty, which is also associated with increased mortality. However, it is unknown if frailty is merely a surrogate for comorbidity, itself an independent domain of risk, or if frailty and comorbidity have differential effects. Better understanding the interplay between these 2 constructs will improve clinical decision making in KT candidates.; Objective: To test whether comorbidity is equally associated with waitlist mortality among frail and nonfrail KT candidates and to test whether measuring both comorbidity burden and frailty improves mortality risk prediction.; Methods: We studied 2,086 candidates on the KT waitlist (November 2009 - October 2017) in a multicenter cohort study, in whom frailty and comorbidity were measured at evaluation. We quantified the association between Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) adapted for end-stage renal disease and waitlist mortality using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model and tested whether this association differed between frail and nonfrail candidates.; Results: At evaluation, 18.1{\%} of KT candidates were frail and 51{\%} had a high comorbidity burden (CCI score ≥2). Candidates with a high comorbidity burden were at 1.38-fold (95{\%} CI 1.01-1.89) increased risk of waitlist mortality. However, this association differed by frailty status (p for interaction = 0.01): among nonfrail candidates, a high comorbidity burden was associated with a 1.66-fold (95{\%} CI 1.17-2.35) increased mortality risk; among frail candidates, here was no statistically significant association (HR 0.75, 95{\%} CI 0.44-1.29). Adding this interaction between comorbidity and frailty to a mortality risk estimation model significantly improved prediction, increasing the c-statistic from 0.640 to 0.656 (p {\textless} 0.001).; Conclusions: Nonfrail candidates with a high comorbidity burden at KT evaluation have an increased risk of waitlist mortality.

abstract = {Needing assistance with activities of daily living (ADL) is an early indicator of functional decline and has important implications for individuals' quality of life. However, correlates of need for ADL assistance have received limited attention among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD). A multicenter cohort of 742 prevalent HD patients was assessed in 2009-2011 and classified as frail, prefrail and nonfrail by the Fried frailty index (recent unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk speed, low physical activity). Patients reported need for assistance with 4 ADL tasks and identified contributing symptoms/conditions (pain, balance, endurance, weakness, others). Nearly 1 in 5 patients needed assistance with 1 or more ADL. Multivariable analysis showed increased odds for needing ADL assistance among frail (odds ratio [OR] 11.35; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 5.50-23.41; P {\textless}0.001) and prefrail (OR 1.93; 95{\%} CI 1.01-3.68; P = 0.046) compared with non-frail patients. In addition, the odds for needing ADL assistance were lower among blacks compared with whites and were higher among patients with diabetes, lung disease, and stroke. Balance, weakness, and "other" (frequently dialysis-related) symptoms/conditions were the most frequently named reasons for ADL difficulty. In addition to interventions such as increasing physical activity that might delay or reverse the process of frailty, the immediate symptoms/conditions to which individuals attribute their ADL difficulty may have clinical relevance for developing targeted management and/or treatment approaches.},

However, their interaction is incompletely defined. METHODS: We studied 178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed by a validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by the Geriatric Depression Scale; nutritional status was determined by subjective global assessment (SGA) and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS). All patients were followed for up to 24 months for survival and hospitalization analysis. RESULTS: There were 111 patients (62.4{\%}) physically frail, amongst those 48 (43.2{\%}) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without frailty. There was an additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty on nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin decreased in a stepwise manner (35.8 +/- 5.6, 34.9 +/- 4.4, and 32.9 +/- 5.3 g/L, respectively, p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 +/- 0.61, 5.41 +/- 0.59, and 5.04 +/- 0.77, respectively (p{\textless} 0.0001), and MIS was 5.12 +/- 2.30, 7.13 +/- 3.22, and 9.48 +/- 3.97, respectively (p{\textless} 0.0001).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frail kidney transplant (KT) recipients have higher risk of adverse post-KT outcomes. Yet, there is interest in measuring frailty at KT evaluation and then using this information for post-KT risk stratification. Given long wait times for KT, frailty may improve or worsen between evaluation and KT. Patterns, predictors, and post-KT adverse outcomes associated with these changes are unclear. METHODS: 569 adult KT candidates were enrolled in a cohort study of frailty (11/2009-09/2017) at evaluation and followed-up at KT. Patterns of frailty transitions were categorized as: 1) binary state change (frail/nonfrail); 2) 3-category state change (frail/intermediate/nonfrail); and 3) raw score change (-5 to 5). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used to test whether patterns of frailty transitions were associated with adverse post-KT outcomes. RESULTS: Between evaluation and KT, 22.0{\%} became more frail, while 24.4{\%} became less frail. Black race (RRR=1.98, 95{\%}CI:1.07-3.67) was associated with frail-to-nonfrail transition; diabetes (RRR=2.56, 95{\%}CI:1.22-5.39) was associated with remaining stably frail. Candidates who became more frail between 3-category states (HR=2.27, 95{\%}CI:1.11-4.65) or frailty scores (HR=2.36, 95{\%}CI:1.12-4.99) had increased risk of post-KT mortality and had higher odds of length of stay (LOS) {\textgreater}/=2 weeks (3-category: OR=2.02, 95{\%}CI:1.20-3.40; scores: OR=1.92, 95{\%}CI:1.13-3.25). CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of KT candidates experienced change in frailty between evaluation and KT, and those transitions were associated with mortality and longer LOS.

Presence of frailty predicts the risk of clinically significant fractures, and frail individuals frequently have osteoporosis.1 Frailty and osteoporosis putatively share a common ground, including coexisting physical inactivity, muscle wasting, weight loss, and nutritional insufficiency.2 Frailty is also highly prevalent in individuals with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD);3 its presence and severity are associated with poor outcomes.4 In addition, individuals with ESRD are at greater risk of hip fracture because of osteoporosis or the abnormal bony architecture resulting from chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (MBD; renal osteodystrophy).5 It is unclear whether the established association between frailty, osteoporosis, and fracture also exists in individuals with ESRD, in whom silent vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are underrecognized.6 The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the relationship between frailty, bone mass, and VCFs in individuals with ESRD.},

RESULTS: Mean age was 66.4 +/- 14.9 years, with 238 males (62{\%}), 48{\%} diabetic, and dialysis vintage 36 (15-75) months. The mean DT score was 4.4 +/- 3.3, with a frailty score of 4.6 +/- 1.5. On multivariable analysis, DT scores were associated with frailty (beta = 0.35, P = .003), prescription of aspirin for cardiac disease (beta = 1.0, P = .004), lean body mass (beta = 0.04, P = .004), and negatively with age (beta = -0.05, P {\textless} .001), hematocrit (beta = -8.2, P = .004), and maximum PS (beta = -1.4, P = .003). CONCLUSION: Paradoxically higher self-reported DT scores were associated with younger age and lean body mass. As such, younger healthier, rather than more comorbid, patients may have greater expectations for their health and therefore report more distress. We found no association between DT scores and HGS, and as such, although HGS is a voluntary test, it appears to be a robust test independent of patient stresses. However, PS was lower in patients with higher DT scores, and as such, greater care may be required in interpreting these measurements.},

Objective: The aim of the study is to define a pattern of frailty among our dialysis population, to analyse the incidence and clinical evolution of these patients. Materials and Methods: We analysed a total of 320 patients with stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were on hemodialysis between September 2014 and September 2015. To define a patient as frail we used the Fried phenotype model, and we added a new criteria-dialysis session length longer than 12 hours/week. Results: 5.6{\%} of the 320 patients were frail. We found statistically significant differences regarding body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin (Hgb), and serum albumin, as well as the ability to perform the basic activities of daily living (p {\textless} 0.005), ability to ambulate (p = 0.01) and perform transfers (p {\textless} 0.005). We found statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of hospital admissions (p = 0.005) and mortality (p {\textless} 0.005). Conclusion: 5.6{\%} of the study population were frail, with lower BMI, serum albumin and hemoglobin, lower capacity for basic activities of daily living, ambulation, and transference, as well as higher morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. However, apart from its influence on cognition, it is currently unknown whether frailty affects subtler cerebral function in patients with ESRD. METHODS: Patients with ESRD were prospectively enrolled, with clinical features and laboratory data recorded. The severity of frailty among these patients with ESRD was ascertained using the previously validated simple FRAIL scale, and was categorized as none-to-mild and moderate-to-severe frailty. All participants underwent quantitative electroencephalography (EEG), with band powers documented following the generation of the delta to alpha ratio (DAR) and delta/theta to alpha/beta ratio (DTABR). EEG results were then compared between groups of different levels of frailty. RESULTS: In this cohort, (mean age: 68.9 +/- 10.4 years, 37{\%} male, 3.4 +/- 3 years of dialysis), 20, 60, 40, 17, and 6{\%} patients exhibited positivity in the fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss-of-body-weight domains, respectively, with 45.7{\%} being none to mildly frail and 54.3{\%} being moderately to severely frail. Those with mild frailty had a significantly higher delta power compared to those with more severe frailty, involving all topographic sites. Patients with ESRD and severe frailty had significantly lower global, left frontal, left temporo-occipital, and right temporo-occipital DAR and DTABR, except in the right frontal area, and tended to have central accentuation of alpha, beta, and theta power, and more homogeneous DTABR and DAR distribution compared to the findings in those with mild frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in patients with ESRD can have subtler neurophysiological influences, presenting as altered EEG findings, which warrant our attention.},

No significant differences regarding age (P = 0.11), gender (P = 0.08), dialysis duration (P = 0.6), comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (P = 0.12), hypertension (P = 0.51), heart failure (P = 0.36), malignancy (P = 0.74), body mass index (BMI; P = 0.5), and laboratory panels were observed between ESRD patients with and without frailty/prefrailty (Table 1), except higher serum creatinine among nonfrail/prefrail ones (P = 0.03). Frail/prefrail ESRD patients had significantly lower total body mass and total lean mass of the whole body and of all anatomical sites, than nonfrail ones (Table 1). However, we found that frail/prefrail ESRD patients had significantly higher fat percentage of all appendices, but not that of their trunk (P = 0.26) or cephalic area (P = 0.99) (Table 1). Univariate analyses revealed that age, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, and SFS scores (all complying with normal distribution, with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test P {\textgreater} 0.05) exhibited significant associations with total lean mass, fat percentages, and those of different anatomical sites, whereas BMI, dialysis duration, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels did not. Stepwise multivariate linear regression with lean body mass and fat percentages as the dependent variables, incorporating significant variables identified in univariate analyses, showed that SFS scores were independently associated with higher appendicular fat percentage (for left, right lower and left, right upper extremities, $\beta$ = 0.34, 0.3, 0.37, and 0.43, t = 2.32, 2.05, 2.66, and 3.09, P = 0.03, 0.048, 0.01, and {\textless}0.01, respectively), but not with those of truncal ($\beta$ = 0.12, t = 0.76, P = 0.45) and cephalic ($\beta$ = 0.13, t = 0.72, P = 0.48) areas. In addition, being frail/prefrail was also independently associated with higher appendicular fat percentages (for left, right lower and right upper extremities, $\beta$ = 0.33, 0.32, and 0.33, t = 2.31, 2.28, and 2.35, P = 0.03, 0.03, and 0.03, respectively), but not with fat percentages of trunk (P = 0.39) and cephalic (P = 0.99) areas. On the contrary, being frail/prefrail was uniformly associated with significantly lower lean mass of all anatomical sites examined. Finally, to satisfy the presumptions of multivariate linear regression analyses and to ensure model validity, we checked the distribution pattern of the residuals of these models and evaluated the possibility of multicollinearity. The residuals for all models were normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test P = 0.2), and variance inflation factor for all models were lower than five, suggesting the absence of multicollinearity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty exhibits a high prevalence in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and is associated with adverse health-related outcomes, including falls and fractures. Available studies do not address whether frailty is associated with temporal changes in BMD. We evaluated this issue by analyzing the follow-up dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results in an ESRD cohort. METHODS: In 2015, we enrolled forty-three ESRD patients, divided into frail, pre-frail, and robust ones based on a validated simple FRAIL scale, all receiving DXA at baseline. After one year of follow-up, survivors received another DXA, and we calculated the absolute and percentage changes in area, bone mineral density (BMD), T-, and Z-scores of lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN) between baseline and follow-up examinations. RESULTS: Among all, frail individuals with ESRD had significantly lower average lumbar spine area, lower L4, FN, and total BMD and T-scores, lower FN and total Z-scores than non-frail ones, without differences in gender, body mass index, dialysis duration, and comorbidities. Furthermore, we discovered frail ESRD patients had significantly more prominent decrease in average lumbar spine area, percentage changes in L1 Z-scores and average lumbar spine area, and a trend toward more prominent decrease in L4 area than non-frail ones after one year of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline frailty might be associated with deteriorating bone health, including shrinking L-spine areas and a more rapid decrease in L-spine Z scores, among ESRD patients.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Restoration of kidney function after kidney transplant generally improves cognitive function. It is unclear whether frail recipients, with higher susceptibility to surgical stressors, achieve such post-transplant cognitive improvements or whether they experience subsequent cognitive decline as they age with a functioning graft. METHODS: In this two-center cohort study, we assessed pretransplant frailty (Fried physical frailty phenotype) and cognitive function (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination) in adult kidney transplant recipients. To investigate potential short- and medium-term effects of frailty on post-transplant cognitive trajectories, we measured cognitive function up to 4 years post-transplant. Using an adjusted mixed effects model with a random slope (time) and intercept (person), we characterized post-transplant cognitive trajectories by pretransplant frailty, accounting for nonlinear trajectories. RESULTS: Of 665 recipients (mean age 52.0 years) followed for a median of 1.5 years, 15.0{\%} were frail. After adjustment, pretransplant cognitive scores were significantly lower among frail patients compared with nonfrail patients (89.0 versus 90.8 points). By 3 months post-transplant, cognitive performance improved for both frail (slope =0.22 points per week) and nonfrail (slope =0.14 points per week) recipients. Between 1 and 4 years post-transplant, improvements plateaued among nonfrail recipients (slope =0.005 points per week), whereas cognitive function declined among frail recipients (slope =-0.04 points per week). At 4 years post-transplant, cognitive scores were 5.8 points lower for frail recipients compared with nonfrail recipients. CONCLUSIONS: On average, both frail and nonfrail recipients experience short-term cognitive improvement post-transplant.

Frailty has been associated with poor cognitive function in older adults without kidney disease. We hypothesized that frailty might also be associated with poor cognitive function in adults of all ages undergoing HD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, {\&} MEASUREMENTS At HD initiation, 324 adults enrolled (November 2008 to July 2012) in a longitudinal cohort study (Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in ESRD) were classified into three groups (frail, intermediately frail, and nonfrail) based on the Fried frailty phenotype. Global cognitive function (3MS) and speed/attention (Trail Making Tests A and B [TMTA and TMTB, respectively]) were assessed at cohort entry and 1-year follow-up. Associations between frailty and cognitive function (at cohort entry and 1-year follow-up) were evaluated in adjusted (for sex, age, race, body mass index, education, depression and comorbidity at baseline) linear (3MS, TMTA) and Tobit (TMTB) regression models. RESULTS At cohort entry, the mean age was 54.8 years (SD 13.3), 56.5{\%} were men, and 72.8{\%} were black. The prevalence of frailty and intermediate frailty were 34.0{\%} and 37.7{\%}, respectively. The mean 3MS was 89.8 (SD 7.6), TMTA was 55.4 (SD 29), and TMTB was 161 (SD 83). Frailty was independently associated with lower cognitive function at cohort entry for all three measures (3MS: -2.4 points; 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], -4.2 to -0.5; P=0.01; TMTA: 12.1 seconds; 95{\%} CI, 4.7 to 19.4; P{\textless}0.001; and TMTB: 33.2 seconds; 95{\%} CI, 9.9 to 56.4; P=0.01; all tests for trend, P{\textless}0.001) and with worse 3MS at 1-year follow-up (-2.8 points; 95{\%} CI, -5.4 to -0.2; P=0.03).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of falls, with subsequent complications including fractures, loss of independence, hospitalization, and institutionalization. Factors associated with falls are poorly understood in this population. We hypothesized that insights derived from studies of the elderly might apply to adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis; we focused on frailty, a phenotype of physiological decline strongly associated with falls in the elderly. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study of 95 patients undergoing hemodialysis (1/2009-3/2010), the association of frailty with future falls was explored using adjusted Poisson regression. Frailty was classified using the criteria established by Fried et al., as a combination of five components: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed. RESULTS: Over a median 6.7-month period of longitudinal follow-up, 28.3{\%} of study participants (25.9{\%} of those under 65, 29.3{\%} of those 65 and older) experienced a fall. After adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidity, disability, number of medications, marital status, and education, frailty independently predicted a 3.09-fold (95{\%} CI: 1.38-6.90, P=0.006) higher number of falls. This relationship between frailty and falls did not differ for younger and older adults (P=0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, a validated construct in the elderly, was a strong and independent predictor of falls in adults undergoing hemodialysis, regardless of age. Our results may aid in identifying frail hemodialysis patients who could be targeted for multidimensional fall prevention strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with worse health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older adults and worse clinical outcomes in adults of all ages with end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is unclear whether frail adults of all ages with ESRD are more likely to experience worse HRQOL. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to identify factors associated with worsening HRQOL in this population. DESIGN, SETTING AND MEASUREMENTS: We studied 233 adults of all ages with ESRD enrolled (11/2009-11/2013) in a longitudinal cohort study. Frailty status was measured at enrollment and HRQOL was reported (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor) at the initial assessment and follow-up (median follow-up 9.4 months). We studied factors associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up using logistic regression and factors associated with HRQOL change using multinomial regression. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, BMI, diabetes status, history of a previous transplant, type of dialysis and time between assessments. RESULTS: Fair/Poor HRQOL was reported by 28{\%} at initial assessment and 33{\%} at follow-up. 47.2{\%} of participants had stable HRQOL, 22.8{\%} better HRQOL, and 30.0{\%} worse HRQOL at follow-up (P{\textless}0.001). In adjusted models, only frailty was associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up (OR: 2.79, 95{\%} CI: 1.32-5.90) and worsening HRQOL at follow-up (RR: 2.91, 95{\%}CI: 1.08-7.80). CONCLUSIONS: Frail adults of all ages with ESRD are more likely to experience fair/poor HRQOL and worsening HRQOL over time. Frailty represents a state of decreased physiologic reserve that impacts not only clinical outcomes but also the patient-centered outcome of HRQOL.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis; however, previous studies have not taken into account the severity of frailty as a predictor of outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess if there was an association between the degree of frailty and mortality among patients on incident dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, {\&} MEASUREMENTS: A cohort study of incident chronic dialysis patients was conducted between January of 2009 and June of 2013 (last follow-up in December of 2013). On the basis of overall clinical impression, the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score was determined for patients at the start of dialysis by their primary nephrologist. This simple scale allocates a single point to different states of frailty (1, very fit; 2, well; 3, managing well; 4, vulnerable; 5, mildly frail; 6, moderately frail; 7, severely frail or terminally ill) with an emphasis on function of the assessed individual. The primary outcome was time to death. Patients were censored at the time of transplantation. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 390 patients with completed CFS scores (mean age of 63+/-15 years old). Most were Caucasian (89{\%}) and men (67{\%}), and 30{\%} of patients had ESRD caused by diabetic nephropathy. The median Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 4 (interquartile range =3-6), and the median CFS score was 4 (interquartile range =2-5). There were 96 deaths over 750 patient-years at risk. In an adjusted Cox survival analysis, the hazard ratio associated with each 1-point increase in the CFS was 1.22 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.43; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: A higher severity of frailty (as defined by the CFS) at dialysis initiation is associated with higher mortality.},

The goal of this study was to estimate its association with postkidney transplantation (post-KT) mortality. Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to substantially improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients (n = 37 858) and introduced these into the single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5{\%}, 86.0{\%} and 77.5{\%} for nonfrail, intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95{\%} CI: 1.01-4.65, p = 0.047) higher risk of death.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reflects a patient's disease burden, treatment effectiveness, and health status and is summarized by physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific scales among end-stage renal disease patients. Although on average HRQOL improves postkidney transplant (KT), the degree of change depends on the ability of the patient to withstand the stressor of dialysis versus the ability to tolerate the intense physiologic changes of KT. Frail KT recipients may be extra vulnerable to either of these stressors, thus affecting change in HRQOL after KT. METHODS We ascertained frailty, as well as physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific HRQOL in a multicenter prospective cohort of 443 KT recipients (May 2014 to May 2017) using Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short Form. We quantified the short-term (3 months) rate of post-KT HRQOL change by frailty status using adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models. RESULTS Mean HRQOL scores at KT were 43.3 (SD, 9.6) for physical, 52.8 (SD, 8.9) for mental, and 72.6 (SD, 12.8) for kidney disease-specific HRQOL; frail recipients had worse physical (P {\textless} 0.001) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (P = 0.001), but similar mental HRQOL (P = 0.43).

abstract = {PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces frailty and worsens quality of life (QOL), even in the early stages of the disease and in young patients. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the relationship between frailty and QOL in CKD patients. Thus, we investigated this relationship in a sample of CKD patients. METHODS: A cross-observational study was conducted, in which 61 CKD patients receiving pre-dialysis treatment were assessed. All participants completed the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used valid and reliable methods to classify subjects as frail or non-frail according to Johansen's et al. (2007) criteria. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used to compare the groups. In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to measure associations between identified variables and frailty. We also performed simple linear regression using the SF-36 physical and mental composite scores. RESULTS: Almost half of the sample (42.6{\%}) exhibited evidence of frailty. The groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, and all SF-36 domains, excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Frailty was significantly associated with all SF-36 domains, again excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Regression analysis revealed no significant between-group differences in composite physical and mental health scores generated by the SF-36 (p {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Frail and non-frail CKD patients differed significantly in seven of the eight SF-36 domains. The frail group displayed diminished physical and mental functioning when their SF-36 scores were divided by their physical and mental composite scores. Frailty was correlated with QOL domains, with the exception of the social domain. There is a need for interventions targeting the characteristics of frailty, to provide better treatment and optimize overall QOL.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Frailty among the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population is highly prevalent and has been associated with mortality. Little is known about the relation of different aspects of body composition, a modifiable risk factor, with the risk of frailty in ESRD population. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-one patients including 85 men and 66 women, aged {\textgreater}/=18 years with ESRD who had been receiving conventional maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for at least 3 months were included. Body fat and muscle mass from both bioimpedance spectroscopy and skin-fold thickness and waist circumference as a surrogate of abdominal obesity were measured. Frailty was defined based on Fried's criteria. Health-related quality of life was collected using the RAND version of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36) Survey. RESULTS: We performed single and multiple predictor logistic regression analyses to determine factors associated with frailty. After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, fat mass (both by bioimpedance spectroscopy and anthropometry) and waist circumference, but not muscle mass remained the main predictors of frailty. The odds ratio of frailty in the third tertile compared with the first was 4.97 (1.70-14.55) and 3.84 (1.39-10.61) for fat mass and waist circumference, respectively (P for trends for both {\textless}.05). The scores of physical health and kidney disease effect component of quality of life were lower in frail compared with nonfrail patients (40.7 +/- 9.2 vs. 33.7 +/- 10.2, P {\textless} .01 and 66.8 +/- 22.4 vs. 51.6 +/- 25.7, P {\textless} .05 for physical health and effects of disease, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, which is associated with poor outcomes in chronic HD patients, is common and predicted by fat mass and waist circumference but not by body mass index and muscle mass. Interventions to modify abdominal obesity, reflected by waist circumference, could potentially lower the incidence of frailty and hence improve the quality of life in the HD population.},

abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Frailty is a distinct clinical syndrome beyond just being old and ultimately results in increased risk for disability, hospitalization, and death. Interestingly, it has been reported that frailty is more common and appears even in early stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and much younger population of this group compared to the general population. We investigated the prevalence, correlates of frailty and the association of frailty with hospitalization‐free survival among clinically stable patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD). Methods: Between July 2012 and December 2012, we recruited study subjects according to the inclusion criteria as follows: (1) age of 20 years or older, (2) at least 6 months or longer on dialysis, (3) no hospitalization for the last 3 months, except for vascular access problem in case of MHD patients, (4) ambulatory patients with or without assistive device, (5) cognitive enough to answer the questionnaires without help from others, and (6) gave informed consent without proxy and finally followed 1,658 patients ( MHD =1,255 and CPD = 403) until August 2014. We adopted frailty phenotype composed of the following components; 1) unintentional weight loss more than 4.5 Kg or 5{\%} of the previous body weight for the last 1 year, 2) physical inactivity, 3) RAND‐36 physical function (PF) scale {\textless}75 and vitality scale {\textless}55 as surrogates for weakness/slowness and exhaustion, respectively. Low PF scale was scored as 2 points and other components as 1 point for each. Those with 0, 1‐2 and 3 or more points were considered as non‐frail, pre‐frail and frail, respectively. Demographic data were obtained by review of medical records. Blood chemistry data used were the values averaged over the three consecutive routine checkup. Results: The 1,658 participants evaluated were 55.9 +/‐12.9 years of age (mean +/‐ SD) on dialysis for 5.2+/‐4.5 years; 55.7{\%} were male and 39.4{\%} were diabetes. Frail subjects were 577 (34.8 {\%}) and 757 (45.7{\%}) were pre‐frail. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female sex, unemployed status, older age, higher body mass index, lower education level, lower TIBC and comorbid conditions were independently associated with frailty. During the 86 weeks follow‐up period, 608 patients were hospitalized. The proportion with hospitalizations was 24.4{\%} for non‐frail, 33.0{\%} for pre‐frail and 48.4{\%} for frail (P{\textless} 0.001). On univariate analysis, pre‐frail and frail patients were as 1.4 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.07 to 1.78) and 2.4 (95{\%} CI 1.86 to 3.07) times as more likely to be hospitalized, respectively. Frail phenotype remained significantly associated with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 1.80; 95{\%} CI 1.4 to 2.3) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Conclusions: Frailty phenotype was very common and significant predictor of hospitalization‐free survival even in a relatively healthy patients receiving chronic dialysis. More studies are necessary for preventing or attenuating frailty in the chronic dialysis patients.},

This study assesses whether frailty influence 30-day postoperative complications after kidney transplantation. One-hundred and fifty kidney transplantations were prospectively included. Frailty was assessed using a frailty indicator, consisting of 15 questions, covering most domains of functioning. Postoperative complications were measured by the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Using a linear regression model, 30-day postoperative complications and frailty correlation were adjusted for confounders, including sex, age, ASA Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, BMI, smoking, dialysis, duration of dialysis, type of transplantation, and retransplantation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies showed that frailty is prevalent in both pre-dialysis and dialysis patients. However, the prevalence and prognostic implication of frailty in Chinese peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients remain unknown. METHODS: We used a validated questionnaire to determine the Frailty Score of 193 unselected prevalent PD patients. All patients were then followed for 2 years for their need of hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: Amongst the 193 patients, 134 (69.4{\%}) met the criteria of being frail. Frailty Score significantly correlated with Charlson's comorbidity score (r = 0.40, p {\textless} 0.0001), Malnutrition Inflammation Score (r = 0.59, p {\textless} 0.0001), and inversely with Subjective Global Assessment score (r = -0.44, p {\textless} 0.0001). Frailty was closely associated with the need of hospitalization. Patients with nil, mild, moderate, and severe frailty required 2.4 +/- 6.0, 1.6 +/- 1.6, 2.7 +/- 2.5, 5.2 +/- 4.8 hospital admissions per year, respectively (p {\textless} 0.0001), and they stayed in hospital for 6.4 +/- 9.2, 5.3 +/- 6.2, 10.0 +/- 10.4, 12.9 +/- 20.1 days per hospital admission, respectively (p {\textless} 0.0001). However, Frailty Score was not an independent predictor of patient or technique survival. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is prevalent among Chinese PD patients. Frail PD patients have a high risk of requiring hospitalization and their hospital stay tends to be prolonged. Early identification may allow timely intervention to prevent adverse health outcomes in this group of patients.},

In this work, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of frailty in a group of Portuguese ESRD patients, and its association with socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. We performed a cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3 [+/-14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire. Social support, data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory markers were also evaluated. Our results confirmed that frailty is a highly prevalent condition in ESRD patients, particularly in female patients. An association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.},

abstract = {End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death, the risk of which is presumably related to arrhythmia. Electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters have been found to correlate with arrhythmia and predict cardiovascular outcomes in ESRD patients. Frailty is also a common feature in this population. We investigate whether the severity of dialysis frailty is associated with ECG findings, including PR interval, QRS duration, and QTc interval. Presence and severity of frailty was ascertained using six different self-report questionnaires with proven construct validity. Correlation analysis between frailty severity and ECG was made, and those with significant association entered into multiple regression analysis for confirmation. Among a cohort of chronic hemodialysis patients, we found that frailty severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale, is significantly associated with QRS duration (r = - 0.3, p {\textless} 0.05). Dialysis patients with QRS longer than 120 ms had significantly lower severity of frailty than those with QRS less than 120 ms (p = 0.01 for the Edmonton frailty scale and 0.05 for simple FRAIL scale). Regression analysis showed that frailty severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale and simple FRAIL scale, was significantly associated with QRS duration independent of serum electrolyte levels. In conclusion, a significant relationship exists between the severity of frailty and QRS duration in ESRD patients. This might be an under-recognized link between frailty and its adverse cardiovascular impact in these patients.},

abstract = {Background: Frail obese community-dwelling older adults are at increased mortality risk. Among hemodialysis (HD) patients, frailty is common and associated with increased mortality risk; however, in dialysis, obesity is associated with decreased mortality risk. Whether the frail-obese phenotype is associated with increased mortality risk among HD patients remains unclear. Methods: This study included 370 incident HD patients enrolled in the Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End Stage Renal Disease (PACE) study. We measured frailty using the Fried phenotype, general obesity [body mass index (BMI) {\textgreater}/=30 kg/m2] and abdominal obesity [waist:hip ratio (WHR) {\textgreater}/=median WHR] and estimated their associations with mortality. Results: The mean age was 55 years, with 42{\%} female, 73{\%} African American, 57{\%} diabetic and 52{\%} frail. Frail HD patients had higher mean BMI (frail = 30.3 kg/m2, non-frail = 28.3 kg/m2; P = 0.02) and similar WHR (P = 0.8). Twenty-two percent were frail with general obesity and 27{\%} were frail with abdominal obesity. Frailty was associated with 1.66-fold increased mortality risk [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.67]. BMI was associated with a decreased mortality risk [25.0-29.9 kg/m2 hazard ratio (HR) 0.53 (95{\%} CI 0.31-0.93); {\textgreater}/=30 kg/m2 HR 0.34 (95{\%} CI 0.19-0.62)]. Frailty was associated with elevated mortality risk among HD patients with general [HR 3.77 (95{\%} CI 1.10-12.92)] and abdominal obesity [HR 2.38 (95{\%} CI 1.17-4.82)]. Frailty was not associated with mortality among HD patients without general or abdominal obesity. Conclusions: In adults initiating HD, frailty was associated with elevated mortality risk, even among the obese. Frail-obese HD patients may be a high-risk, often-overlooked population, as obesity is assumed to be protective. Measurement of frailty and obesity may facilitate risk stratification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between earlier dialysis initiation and mortality. METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73{\%}. In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95{\%} CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P {\textless} .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95{\%} CI, 1.25-1.97]; P {\textless} .001) and time to first hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.45]; P {\textless} .001). While higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.23] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95{\%} CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation. Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.},

This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition, HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5). Methods: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale); depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools. Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights {\textgreater}136 kg, and coinciding comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded. Results: Frailty occurred in 17{\%} of participants (n=7). Frail participants had lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more depression (p={\textless}0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p{\textless}0.05). No differences in health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail participants (p{\textgreater}0.05). Conclusions: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test whether frailty, a novel measure of physiologic reserve, is associated with longer kidney transplant (KT) length of stay (LOS), and modifies the association between LOS and mortality. BACKGROUND: Better understanding of LOS is necessary for informed consent and discharge planning. Mortality resulting from longer LOS has important regulatory implications for hospital and transplant programs. Which recipients are at risk of prolonged LOS and its effect on mortality are unclear. Frailty is a novel preoperative predictor of poor KT outcomes including delayed graft function, early hospital readmission, immunosuppression intolerance, and mortality. METHODS: We used registry-augmented hybrid methods, a novel approach to risk adjustment, to adjust for LOS risk factors from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (n = 74,859) and tested whether (1) frailty, measured immediately before KT in a novel cohort (n = 589), was associated with LOS (LOS: negative binomial regression; LOS {\textgreater}/=2 weeks: logistic regression) and (2) whether frailty modified the association between LOS and mortality (interaction term analysis). RESULTS: Frailty was independently associated with longer LOS [relative risk = 1.15, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.29; P = 0.01] and LOS {\textgreater}/=2 weeks (odds ratio = 1.57, 95{\%} CI: 1.06-2.33; P = 0.03) after accounting for registry-based risk factors, including delayed graft function. Frailty also attenuated the association between LOS and mortality (nonfrail hazard rate = 1.55 95{\%} CI: 1.30-1.86; P {\textless} 0.001; frail hazard rate = 0.97, 95{\%} CI: 0.79-1.19, P = 0.80; P for interaction = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frail KT recipients are more likely to experience a longer LOS. Longer LOS among nonfrail recipients may be a marker of increased mortality risk. Frailty is a measure of physiologic reserve that may be an important clinical marker of longer surgical LOS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose reduction or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead to rejection and possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known about what factors might cause or contribute to MDR. Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is emerging as an important, novel domain of risk in kidney transplantation recipients. We hypothesized that frailty, an inflammatory phenotype, might be associated with MDR. METHODS: We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor characteristics, longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 kidney transplantation recipients. Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: By 2 years after transplantation, 54{\%} of frail recipients and 45{\%} of nonfrail recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67{\%} and 51{\%}. Frail recipients were 1.29 times (95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], 1.01-1.66; P = 0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased donor recipients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.92; 95{\%} CI, 1.44-2.54, P {\textless} 0.001) and older adults (age {\textgreater}/= 65 vs {\textless}65; aHR, 1.47; 95{\%} CI, 1.10-1.96, P = 0.01). Mycophenolate mofetil dose reduction was independently associated with a substantially increased risk of death-censored graft loss (aHR, 5.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.97-13.98, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: A better understanding of risk factors for MMF intolerance might help in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression and prolong allograft survival.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently over 55{\%} of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are aged ≥60 years and patients {\textgreater}75 years represent the fastest growing segment of the dialysis population. We aimed to assess whether the Groningen frailty indicator (GFI) can be used to distinguish fit older ESRD patients, likely able to tolerate and benefit from dialysis, from frail older patients who need further evaluation with a geriatrician's comprehensive assessment.

METHODS: All patients aged ≥65 years visiting the pre-dialysis unit at the Gelre hospital between 2007 and 2013 were included and underwent the GFI (n = 65). Patients with GFI ≥ 4 (frail) were referred for geriatric consultation (n = 13). Results of the GFI and nephrologists' evaluation were compared with geriatrician's assessment. Survival rates and outcomes after one year of follow up were recorded.

RESULTS: Twenty patients (32{\%}) were identified as frail. Of the problems identified by the geriatrician in 13 patients, 55{\%} were not reported in the nephrologists' notes. The first year after inclusion, 30{\%} of patients with a GFI ≥ 4 died, compared to 9{\%} of fit patients (p = 0.04). Moreover, 90{\%} of frail patients had been hospitalized one or more times, compared to 53{\%} in the fit group (p = 0.005).

CONCLUSION: Although the GFI can be a useful instrument to identify ESRD patients at risk, both the GFI and the nephrologists' assessment failed to identify specific geriatric impairments. Further research is needed to develop a specific frailty indicator for ESRD patients and to determine the value and effect of a comprehensive geriatric assessment in ESRD patients.},

abstract = {Background Frail kidney transplant (KT) recipients may be particularly vulnerable to surgical stressors, resulting in delirium and subsequent adverse outcomes. We sought to identify the incidence, risk factors, and sequelae of post-KT delirium.Methods We studied 125,304 adult KT recipients (1999-2014) to estimate delirium incidence in national registry claims. Additionally, we used a validated chart abstraction algorithm to identify post-KT delirium in 893 adult recipients (2009-2017) from a cohort study of frailty. Delirium sequelae were identified using adjusted logistic regression (length of stay ≥2 weeks and institutional discharge [skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility]) and adjusted Cox regression (death-censored graft loss and mortality).Results Only 0.8{\%} of KT recipients had a delirium claim. In the cohort study, delirium incidence increased with age (18-49 years old: 2.0{\%}; 50-64 years old: 4.6{\%}; 65-75 years old: 9.2{\%}; and ≥75 years old: 13.8{\%}) and frailty (9.0{\%} versus 3.9{\%}); 20.0{\%} of frail recipients aged ≥75 years old experienced delirium. Frailty was independently associated with delirium (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], 1.02 to 4.13; P=0.04), but premorbid global cognitive function was not. Recipients with delirium had increased risks of ≥2-week length of stay (OR, 5.42; 95{\%} CI, 2.76 to 10.66; P{\textless}0.001), institutional discharge (OR, 22.41; 95{\%} CI, 7.85 to 63.98; P{\textless}0.001), graft loss (hazard ratio [HR], 2.73; 95{\%} CI, 1.14 to 6.53; P=0.03), and mortality (HR, 3.12; 95{\%} CI, 1.76 to 5.54; P{\textless}0.001).Conclusions Post-KT delirium is a strong risk factor for subsequent adverse outcomes, yet it is a clinical entity that is often missed.},

abstract = {Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.

Methods

Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.

Results

Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 {\%}) were frail. Frail patients were significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower physical and mental quality of life.

Conclusions

Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of life.},

abstract = {Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined as a multidimensional frailty score of {\textgreater}/= 10. The main outcome was the composite of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016. The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0{\%} of them were men. During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4{\%}. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In-center hemodialysis (HD) is often the default dialysis modality for older patients. Few centers use assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD), which enables treatment at home. This observational study compared quality of life (QoL) and physical function between older patients on assisted PD and HD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, {\&} MEASUREMENTS: Patients on assisted PD who were {\textgreater}60 years old and on dialysis for {\textgreater}3 months were recruited and matched to patients on HD (needing hospital transport) by age, sex, diabetes, dialysis vintage, ethnicity, and index of deprivation. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale. QoL assessments included Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Short Form-12, Palliative Outcomes Symptom Scale (renal), Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale, and Renal Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (RTSQ). Physical function was evaluated by Barthel Score and timed up and go test. RESULTS: In total, 251 patients (129 PD and 122 HD) were recruited. In unadjusted analysis, patients on assisted PD had a higher prevalence of possible depression (HADS{\textgreater}8; PD=38.8{\%}; HD=23.8{\%}; P=0.05) and higher HADS depression score (median: PD=6; HD=5; P=0.05) but higher RTSQ scores (median: PD=55; HD=51; P{\textless}0.01). In a generalized linear regression model adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, dialysis vintage, and frailty, assisted PD continued to be associated with higher RTSQ scores (P=0.04) but not with other QoL measures. CONCLUSIONS: There are no differences in measures of QoL and physical function between older patients on assisted PD and comparable patients on HD, except for treatment satisfaction, which is higher in patients on PD. Assisted PD should be considered as an alternative to HD for older patients, allowing them to make their preferred choices.},

abstract = {Background: Many people on dialysis suffer a variety of conditions that can affect frailty (the condition or quality of being frail), such as comorbidities, disabilities, dependence, malnutrition, cognitive impairment and poor social conditions. Frailty is suspected to affect quality of life (QoL). Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of the different components of frailty on the QoL of people on dialysis. Methods: We enrolled 203 out of 233 prevalent patients on dialysis in the Trieste area of Italy. We applied the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire, Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Subjective Global Assessment scales and Karnofsky Index. In addition we analysed their social conditions. Results: Dependence, malnutrition and disability had a negative role on QoL. Living with family and good social-economic conditions were significantly related to a better QoL. Conclusions: Dependence, malnutrition, disability, poor social and economic conditions have a significant effect on life quality. The role of comorbidities appears to be less important. Screening of patients, nutritional and functional rehabilitation and prevention of social isolation appear to be indispensable in guaranteeing a satisfactory life quality. {\textcopyright} 2013 European Dialysis and Transplant Nurses Association/European Renal Care Association.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is known that sarcopenia is related to malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis (MIA) syndrome and is an important problem in dialysis patients. The notion of frailty includes various physical, psychological, and social aspects. Although it has been reported that sarcopenia is associated with poor prognosis in patients with hemodialysis, reports on peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are rare. In this study, we examined the morbidity and mortality of sarcopenia and frailty in PD patients. We also investigated the MIA-related factors. METHODS: We evaluated 119 patients cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria and the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) were used to diagnose sarcopenia and frailty. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality with sarcopenia and frailty. The secondary outcome is the relationship between various MIA-related factors. RESULTS: Morbidity of sarcopenia and frailty in PD patients was 8.4{\%} and 10.9{\%}, respectively. Old age, high values of Barthel Index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, CFS, and low values of body mass index (BMI), muscle strength, muscle mass, and slow walking were associated with sarcopenia. Interleukin-6, albumin, and prealbumin were significantly correlated with muscle mass. During follow-up, the presence of sarcopenia or frailty was associated with the risk of mortality. In multivariate analysis, CFS was related to the mortality rate of PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of sarcopenia or frailty was associated with a worse prognosis.},

The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of frailty among a cohort of incident dialysis patients and to determine the degree to which frailty was associated with death and hospitalization. We studied a cohort of 2275 adults who participated in the Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Wave 2 study, of whom two-thirds met our definition of frailty: a composite construct that incorporated poor self-reported physical functioning, exhaustion/fatigue, low physical activity, and undernutrition. Multivariable logistic regression analysis suggested that older age, female sex, and hemodialysis (rather than peritoneal dialysis) were independently associated with frailty. Cox proportional hazards modeling indicated that frailty was independently associated with higher risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.60–3.15) and with the combined outcome of death or hospitalization (adjusted HR 1.63, 95{\%} CI 1.41–1.87).

Methods: A prospectively enrolled rural chronic dialysis cohort was used for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered to these patients. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and clinical parameters/dialysis complications, including anemia, inflammation, and dyselectrolytemia were performed. Variables demonstrating significant correlations were further tested in multiple regression analyses to determine their associations. Results: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire were significantly associated with each other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated significantly with age (p = 0.02), female gender (p = 0.03), higher Liu's comorbidity index (p = 0.02), lower serum albumin (p = 0.03) and creatinine levels (p {\textless} 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (p = 0.02) (figure).

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis in France. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network. We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis. RESULTS: A total of 166 (39{\%}) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259 (61{\%}) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14{\%}) patients received a renal allograft and 19 (4{\%}) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95{\%} CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96{\%}, 85{\%}, 68{\%} and 53{\%}, respectively. A total of 143 (41{\%}) patients died after a median of 16 months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29{\%}), infections (20{\%}), malnutrition (13{\%}), malignancies (4{\%}), AAV relapse (2{\%}), miscellaneous (14{\%}) and unknown (18{\%}). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P {\textless} 0.001), peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P {\textless} 0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20{\%} vs. 8{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of frailty and the association of vitamin D levels and the frailty phenotype among non-geriatric dialysis patients. METHOD Seventy-four stable, chronic hemodialysis patients from the hemodialysis unit of the hospital were enrolled in the study. The patients' medical histories and laboratory findings were obtained from the medical records of the dialysis unit. Serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were determined using chemiluminometric immunoassays. Frailty was defined by Fried et al. as a phenotype; shrinking, weakness, self-reported exhaustion, decreased activity and slowed walking speed were evaluated. RESULTS Forty-one (55{\%}) of the patients were males. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to frailty scores: 39 (53{\%}) patients were frail, 6 (8{\%}) patients were intermediately frail, and 28 (39{\%}) patients were normal. Significant differences were found for 25-hydroxy vitamin D and hemoglobin levels among the groups; however, no differences were observed in body mass index, comorbidities, sex, marital status, education, disease and dialysis durations, or parathyroid hormone, creatinine, serum calcium, phosphorus, and potassium levels. CONCLUSIONS Weakness and slowness are serious outcomes of both vitamin D deficiency and frailty, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risks of decreased physical activity, falls, fractures and death in postmenopausal women and older men. Although studies on frailty have focused on older adults, growing evidence indicates that the frailty phenotype is becoming a factor associated with poor health outcomes in non-geriatric populations with chronic disease.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is highly prevalent in the dialysis population and is associated with mortality. Recent studies have suggested that other dialysis outcomes are compromised in frail individuals. While we do not yet have a consensus as to the best measure of frailty, identification of these poor outcomes and their magnitude of association with frailty will help improve prognostication, allow for earlier interventions, and improve provider-to-patient communication. RECENT FINDINGS: The most widely used assessment of frailty is Fried's physical performance criteria. However, regardless of assessment method, frailty remains highly associated with mortality. More recently, frailty has been associated with falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, vascular access failure, and poor quality of life. Recent large cohort studies provide strong evidence that frailty assessment can provide important prognostic information for providers and patients both before and after initiation of dialysis. Trials aimed at improving frailty are limited and show the promise of augmenting quality of life, although more studies are needed to firmly establish mortality benefits. SUMMARY: We underscore the importance of frailty as a prognostic indicator and identify other recently established consequences of frailty. Widespread adoption of frailty assessment remains limited and researchers continue to find ways of simplifying the data collection process. Timely and regular assessment of frailty may allow for interventions that can mitigate the onset of poor outcomes and identify actionable targets for dialysis providers.},

To investigate the clinical implications of frailty in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and chronic peritoneal dialysis.

Design

In this prospective study, all of the participants completed the Short Form of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, Korean version, to determine their frailty phenotype. We also obtained blood chemistry and demographic data at enrollment. Data regarding the history of hospitalization and death were collected during the follow-up period.

Subjects

We recruited 1,658 patients (1,255 maintenance hemodialysis and 403 chronic peritoneal dialysis) from multidialysis units (n = 27). We excluded patients who had been hospitalized in the previous 3 months.

Main Outcome Measures

Hospitalization and survival rate during study period.

Results

The participants' mean age was 55.2 ± 11.9 years old, and 55.2{\%} were male. Among the participants, 34.8{\%} were rated as frail and 45.7{\%} as prefrail. Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant associations of frailty with age, comorbidity, disability, unemployment, higher body mass index, and a lower educational level. During the follow-up period (median 17.1 months), 608 patients (79 not frail, 250 prefrail, and 279 frail) were hospitalized, and 87 patients (10 not frail, 24 prefrail, and 53 frail) died (P {\textless} .001). Frailty was associated with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.38-2.36) and mortality (hazard ratio, 2.37, 95{\%} confidence interval: 1.11-5.02).

Conclusion

The frailty phenotype was common even in, prevalent end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis, and was significantly associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality.},

abstract = {Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults, affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap with what is considered to be “normal aging,” the presence of a thyroid disorder may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with CKD. If a cause–effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased importance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in France. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, {\&} MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and causes of death were analyzed. RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18{\%}) patients with ALA, 334 (23{\%}) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59{\%}) patients with MCN. Median age was 72 years, and 56{\%} were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was observed in 9.1{\%} of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation was rare in this population (2.3{\%}). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis, 67{\%} died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were malignancies (34.4{\%}), cardiovascular diseases (18{\%}), infections (13.3{\%}), and cachexia (5.2{\%}). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 per year increase; 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty (HR, 1.93; 95{\%} CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95{\%} CI, 1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95{\%} CI, 1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95{\%} CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high BP (HR, 0.80; 95{\%} CI, 0.67 to 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.},
