abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING {\&} PARTICIPANTS: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013). PREDICTORS: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio. OUTCOME: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical activity). RESULTS: 341 (7{\%}) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30{\%}) had eGFRcr{\textless}60mL/min/1.73m(2), 2,480 (50{\%}) had eGFRcys{\textless}60mL/min/1.73m(2), and 1,006 (20{\%}) had albuminuria with albumin excretion {\textgreater}/= 30mg/g. Among frail participants, prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys{\textless}60mL/min/1.73m(2) were 45{\%} and 77{\%}, respectively. Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals with eGFRcr of 60 to {\textless}75mL/min/1.73m(2) were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR categories using eGFRcys (49{\%} to 45-{\textless}60, 32{\%} to 30-{\textless}45, and 3{\%} to {\textless}30mL/min/1.73m(2)). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking {\textgreater}/=10 classes of medications) was more common in frail individuals (54{\%} vs 38{\%} of nonfrail), including classes requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants). LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design. CONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this vulnerable population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between earlier dialysis initiation and mortality. METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73{\%}. In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95{\%} CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P {\textless} .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95{\%} CI, 1.25-1.97]; P {\textless} .001) and time to first hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.45]; P {\textless} .001). While higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.23] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95{\%} CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation. Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with poor physical function, less is known about the longitudinal association between CKD and the decline of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (BADL) among community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: Participants were part of the prospective observational University of Alabama at Birmingham Study of Aging (n = 357). CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Primary outcomes were IADL and BADL decline defined as an increase in the number of activities for which participants reported difficulty after 2 years. Forward stepwise logistic regression was used to determine associations of baseline CKD and functional decline. RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 77.4 (SD = 5.8) years, 41{\%} were African American, and 52{\%} women. IADL decline occurred in 35{\%} of those with CKD and 17{\%} of those without (unadjusted odds ratio, 2.62, 95{\%} confidence intervals [95{\%} CI], 1.59-4.30, p {\textless} .001). BADL decline occurred in 20{\%} and 7{\%} of those with and without CKD, respectively (unadjusted odds ratio, 3.37; 95{\%} CI, 1.73-6.57; p {\textless} .001). Multivariable-adjusted odds ratio's (95{\%} CI's) for CKD-associated IADL and BADL decline were 1.83 (1.06-3.17, p =.030) and 2.46 (1.19-5.12, p = .016), respectively. CKD Stage {\textgreater}/=3B (estimated glomerular filtration rate {\textless}45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was associated with higher multivariable-adjusted odds of both IADL (3.12, 95{\%} CI, 1.38-7.06, p = .006) and BADL (3.78, 95{\%} CI, 1.36-9.77, p = .006) decline. CONCLUSION: In community-dwelling older adults, CKD is associated with IADL and BADL decline.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of serum creatinine to estimate GFR may lead to underestimation of the association between self-reported frailty and kidney function. Our objectives were to evaluate the association of measured GFR (mGFR) with self-reported frailty among patients with CKD and to determine whether self-reported frailty was associated with death after adjusting for mGFR. METHODS: Participants in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (1989-1993) had GFR measured using iothalamate clearance (mGFR), and GFR was estimated based on the CKD-EPI creatinine (eGFRcr) and cystatin C (eGFRcys) equations. We defined self-reported frailty as three or more of: exhaustion, poor physical function, low physical activity, and low body weight. Death was ascertained through 2007 using the National Death Index and the United States Renal Data System. RESULTS: Eight hundred twelve MDRD participants (97 {\%}) had complete data on self-reported frailty (16 {\%} prevalence, N = 130) and mGFR (mean (SD) 33.1 +/- 11.7 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Higher GFR was associated with lower odds of self-reported frailty based on mGFR, (OR 0.71, 95 {\%} CI 0.60-0.86 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), eGFRcr (OR 0.80, 95 {\%} CI 0.67-0.94 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), and eGFRcys (OR 0.75, 95 {\%} CI 0.62-0.90 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Median follow-up was 17 (IQR 11-18) years, with 371 deaths. Self-reported frailty was associated with a higher risk of death (HR 1.71, 95 {\%} CI 1.26-2.30), which was attenuated to a similar degree when mGFR (HR 1.48, 95 {\%} CI 1.08-2.00), eGFRcr (HR 1.57, 95 {\%} CI 1.15-2.10), or eGFRcys (HR 1.51, 95 {\%} CI 1.10-2.10) was included as an indicator of kidney function. CONCLUSIONS: We found an inverse association between kidney function and self-reported frailty that was similar for mGFR, eGFR and eGFRcys. In this relatively healthy cohort of clinical trial participants with CKD, using serum creatinine to estimate GFR did not substantially alter the association of GFR with self-reported frailty or of self-reported frailty with death.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Prognosis of the increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is poor with high risk of functional decline and mortality. Frailty seems to be a good predictor for those patients that will not benefit from dialysis. Varying prevalences between populations are probably related to the instrument used. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of frailty among ESRD patients with two different validated instruments. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients, aged {\textgreater}/=18 years, receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis care between September 2013 and December 2013 in a single dialysis center in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. Frailty was measured with the frailty index (FI) and frailty phenotype (FP). RESULTS: Prevalence of frailty by the FI was 36.8 {\%} among 95 participants with ESRD (age: 65.2 years, SD +/- 12.0). Frailty prevalence among participants aged {\textgreater}/=65 and {\textless}65 years was 43.6 and 27.5 {\%}, respectively. Female sex [odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95 {\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.3-8.0] and a Charlson comorbidity index score of {\textgreater}/=5 (OR 2.6, 95 {\%} CI 1.0-6.6) were associated with frailty. The FI identified different but overlapping participants as frail compared with the FP; 62.5 {\%} of frail participants according to FI were also frail according to the FP. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of frailty among young and elderly ESRD patients is high; being female and having more comorbidity was associated with frailty. Use of a broader definition of frailty, like the FI, gives a higher estimation of prevalence among ESRD patients compared with a physical frailty assessment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients with pre-dialysis CKD. METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385 patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of {\textless}/=24. We determined the prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages G4-G5, not on dialysis. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61{\%}) with CKD stages G4-G5 had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function (p {\textless} 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes deserves further study.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess whether chronic kidney disease (CKD) is independently associated with incident physical-function limitation. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Two sites: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Memphis, Tennessee. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand one hundred thirty-five men and women aged 70 to 79 without functional limitation at baseline from the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study. MEASUREMENTS: Functional limitation was defined as difficulty in walking one-quarter of a mile or climbing 10 steps on two consecutive reports 6 months apart (in the same function). Kidney function was measured using serum cystatin C. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula ({\textless}60 versus {\textgreater} or =60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), was a secondary predictor. Muscle strength, lean body mass according to dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, comorbidity, medication use, and inflammatory markers were evaluated as covariates. RESULTS: Persons in the highest ({\textgreater} or =1.13 mg/L) quartile of cystatin C experienced a significantly higher risk of developing functional limitation than those in the lowest ({\textless}0.86 mg/L) quartile (hazard ratio (HR)=1.70, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=1.40-2.07). The association between the fourth cystatin C quartile and functional limitation remained after adjustment for demographics, lean body mass, comorbidity, muscle strength, and gait speed (HR=1.41, 95{\%} CI=1.13-1.75), although the association was attenuated after adjustment for markers of inflammation (HR=1.15, 95{\%} CI=0.90-1.46). Similar results were found for eGFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), although the association with functional limitation remained after adjustment for inflammatory markers (HR=1.30, 95{\%} CI=1.08-1.56). CONCLUSION: CKD is associated with the development of functional impairment independent of comorbidity, body composition, and tests of strength and physical performance. The mechanism may be related to a heightened inflammatory state in CKD.},

The objective of this study was to describe the baseline physical function in older adults with renal failure referred for transplantation and compare them with older adults with other significant comorbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, {\&} MEASUREMENTS: An observational sample comparing physical performance in renal transplant candidates over age 60 (Renal Failure) to older people with diastolic heart failure (Heart Failure), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or at high risk for cardiovascular disease (High CV Risk) was studied. RESULTS: Older people with Renal Failure were significantly impaired by objective measures of physical function, including lower Short Physical Performance Battery, slower gait speed, and lower grip strength. CONCLUSIONS: Older people referred for renal transplantation had poorer physical performance than older adults with other common chronic diseases and may be at high risk for disability while awaiting transplantation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, {\&} MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during follow-up. RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change, 0.2 points per year; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity (0.6 points per year; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7 points per year; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores (-1.1 points per g/dl; 95{\%} confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition, patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction in frailty score (95{\%} confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic rate was not independently associated with frailty. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores, with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.},

abstract = {Needing assistance with activities of daily living (ADL) is an early indicator of functional decline and has important implications for individuals' quality of life. However, correlates of need for ADL assistance have received limited attention among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD). A multicenter cohort of 742 prevalent HD patients was assessed in 2009-2011 and classified as frail, prefrail and nonfrail by the Fried frailty index (recent unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk speed, low physical activity). Patients reported need for assistance with 4 ADL tasks and identified contributing symptoms/conditions (pain, balance, endurance, weakness, others). Nearly 1 in 5 patients needed assistance with 1 or more ADL. Multivariable analysis showed increased odds for needing ADL assistance among frail (odds ratio [OR] 11.35; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 5.50-23.41; P {\textless} 0.001) and prefrail (OR 1.93; 95{\%} CI 1.01-3.68; P = 0.046) compared with non-frail patients. In addition, the odds for needing ADL assistance were lower among blacks compared with whites and were higher among patients with diabetes, lung disease, and stroke. Balance, weakness, and "other" (frequently dialysis-related) symptoms/conditions were the most frequently named reasons for ADL difficulty. In addition to interventions such as increasing physical activity that might delay or reverse the process of frailty, the immediate symptoms/conditions to which individuals attribute their ADL difficulty may have clinical relevance for developing targeted management and/or treatment approaches.},

abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a cause of worsening physical functioning in older patients. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is highly reliable in older populations, but no data on older hospitalized patients with different degrees of kidney function are available. We aimed at testing the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and SPPB, either global score (range 0-12) or its individual components (muscle strength, balance, and walking speed, each ranging from 0 to 4), in a sample of older hospitalized patients. Our series consisted of 486 patients aged 65 or more consecutively enrolled in 11 acute care medical wards participating to a multicenter observational study. eGFR was obtained by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiological Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Physical performance was objectively measured by the SPPB. The relationship between eGFR and SPPB was investigated by multiple linear regression analysis. Physically impaired patients (SPPB total score{\textless}5) were older, had lower serum albumin and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores as well as higher overall co-morbidity, prevalence of stroke, cancer, and anemia compared to those with intermediate (SPPB=5-8) and good physical performance (SPPB=9-12). Fully adjusted multivariate models showed that eGFR (modeled as 10 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) intervals) was independently associated with the SPPB total score (B=0.49; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]=0.18-0.66; p=0.003), balance (B=0.30; 95{\%} CI=0.10-0.49; p=0.005), and muscle strength (B=0.06; 95{\%} CI=0.01-0.10; p=0.043), but not with walking speed (B=-0.04; 95{\%} CI=-0.09-0.11; p=0.107). In conclusion, reduced renal function is associated with poorer physical performance in older hospitalized patients. SPPB is worthy of testing to monitor changes in physical performance in elderly CKD patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression. RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 {\%}) were frail. Frail patients were significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower physical and mental quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of life.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between serum beta2-microglobulin (B2M) levels and frailty in an elderly Chinese population. DESIGN: A population-based cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data on 1,663 elderly participants (aged 70-84 years) from the aging arm of the Rugao Longevity and Ageing study, a population-based observational two-arm cohort study conducted in Rugao, China. MEASUREMENTS: The serum B2M was measured with chemiluminescence immunoassay by a technician in the biochemistry laboratory of the Rugao People's Hospital. Information on the frailty index and phenotype was collected. RESULTS: The mean B2M levels and frailty index were 1.8 mg/L and 0.16, respectively; 188 (11.3{\%}) participants were classified as frail (frailty phenotype). For a standard deviation increase in B2M, the adjusted odds ratio for frailty phenotype was 1.20 (95{\%} CI: 1.05, 1.39; P=0.009) and the standardized coefficient for frailty index was 0.07 (95{\%} CI: 0.02, 0.11; P=0.004). Relative to the lowest quartile, the highest B2M quartile had a greater risk of prevalent frailty with adjusted odds ratios of 1.68 (95{\%} CI: 1.04, 2.71; P=0.034) for frailty phenotype and 1.51 (95{\%} CI: 1.01, 2.27; P=0.044) for frailty index ({\textgreater}/=0.25). In addition, estimated glomerular filtration rate (based on B2M) or chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate {\textless}60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was significantly associated with frailty phenotype and index. CONCLUSION: B2M was significantly associated with both frailty phenotype and index in elderly Chinese population. The findings underscore the promising kidney relevant biomarkers for identifying vulnerable elderly Chinese population.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces frailty and worsens quality of life (QOL), even in the early stages of the disease and in young patients. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the relationship between frailty and QOL in CKD patients. Thus, we investigated this relationship in a sample of CKD patients. METHODS: A cross-observational study was conducted, in which 61 CKD patients receiving pre-dialysis treatment were assessed. All participants completed the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used valid and reliable methods to classify subjects as frail or non-frail according to Johansen's et al. (2007) criteria. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used to compare the groups. In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to measure associations between identified variables and frailty. We also performed simple linear regression using the SF-36 physical and mental composite scores. RESULTS: Almost half of the sample (42.6{\%}) exhibited evidence of frailty. The groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, and all SF-36 domains, excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Frailty was significantly associated with all SF-36 domains, again excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Regression analysis revealed no significant between-group differences in composite physical and mental health scores generated by the SF-36 (p {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Frail and non-frail CKD patients differed significantly in seven of the eight SF-36 domains. The frail group displayed diminished physical and mental functioning when their SF-36 scores were divided by their physical and mental composite scores. Frailty was correlated with QOL domains, with the exception of the social domain. There is a need for interventions targeting the characteristics of frailty, to provide better treatment and optimize overall QOL.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To quantify the prevalence of frailty in adults of all ages undergoing chronic hemodialysis, its relationship to comorbidity and disability, and its association with adverse outcomes of mortality and hospitalization. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Single hemodialysis center in Baltimore, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-six individuals undergoing hemodialysis enrolled between January 2009 and March 2010 and followed through August 2012. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty, comorbidity, and disability on enrollment in the study and subsequent mortality and hospitalizations. RESULTS: At enrollment, 50.0{\%} of older ({\textgreater}/= 65) and 35.4{\%} of younger ({\textless}65) individuals undergoing hemodialysis were frail; 35.9{\%} and 29.3{\%}, respectively, were intermediately frail. Three-year mortality was 16.2{\%} for nonfrail, 34.4{\%} for intermediately frail, and 40.2{\%} for frail participants. Intermediate frailty and frailty were associated with a 2.7 times (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-7.07, P = .046) and 2.6 times (95{\%} CI = 1.04-6.49, P = .04) greater risk of death independent of age, sex, comorbidity, and disability. In the year after enrollment, median number of hospitalizations was 1 (interquartile range 0-3). The proportion with two or more hospitalizations was 28.2{\%} for nonfrail, 25.5{\%} for intermediately frail, and 42.6{\%} for frail participants. Although intermediate frailty was not associated with number of hospitalizations (relative risk = 0.76, 95{\%} CI = 0.49-1.16, P = .21), frailty was associated with 1.4 times (95{\%} CI = 1.00-2.03, P = .049) more hospitalizations independent of age, sex, comorbidity, and disability. The association between frailty and mortality (interaction P = .64) and hospitalizations (P = .14) did not differ between older and younger participants. CONCLUSIONS: Adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis have a high prevalence of frailty, more than five times as high as community-dwelling older adults. In this population, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent predictor of mortality and number of hospitalizations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of falls, with subsequent complications including fractures, loss of independence, hospitalization, and institutionalization. Factors associated with falls are poorly understood in this population. We hypothesized that insights derived from studies of the elderly might apply to adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis; we focused on frailty, a phenotype of physiological decline strongly associated with falls in the elderly. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study of 95 patients undergoing hemodialysis (1/2009-3/2010), the association of frailty with future falls was explored using adjusted Poisson regression. Frailty was classified using the criteria established by Fried et al., as a combination of five components: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed. RESULTS: Over a median 6.7-month period of longitudinal follow-up, 28.3{\%} of study participants (25.9{\%} of those under 65, 29.3{\%} of those 65 and older) experienced a fall. After adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidity, disability, number of medications, marital status, and education, frailty independently predicted a 3.09-fold (95{\%} CI: 1.38-6.90, P=0.006) higher number of falls. This relationship between frailty and falls did not differ for younger and older adults (P=0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, a validated construct in the elderly, was a strong and independent predictor of falls in adults undergoing hemodialysis, regardless of age. Our results may aid in identifying frail hemodialysis patients who could be targeted for multidimensional fall prevention strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty increases early hospital readmission and mortality risk among kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. Although frailty represents a high-risk state for this population, the correlates of frailty, the patterns of the 5 frailty components, and the risk associated with these patterns are unclear. METHODS: Six hundred sixty-three KT recipients were enrolled in a cohort study of frailty in transplantation (12/2008-8/2015). Frailty, activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) disability, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale depression, education, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were measured. We used multinomial regression to identify frailty correlates. We identified which patterns of the 5 components were associated with mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 19.5{\%}. Older recipients (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR], 2.22; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.07) were more likely to be frail. The only other factors that were independently associated with frailty were IADL disability (PR, 3.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.72-6.06), depressive symptoms (PR, 11.31; 95{\%} CI, 4.02-31.82), less than a high school education (PR, 3.10; 95{\%} CI, 1.30-7.36), and low HRQOL (fair/poor: PR, 3.71; 95{\%} CI, 1.48-9.31). The most common pattern was poor grip strength, low physical activity, and slowed walk speed (19.4{\%}). Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged as having an association with post-KT mortality. KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed walking speed (hazards ratio = 2.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.17-5.03) and poor grip strength, exhaustion, and slowed walking speed (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95{\%} CI, 1.14-5.97) were at increased mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty among KT recipients; however, factors rarely measured as part of clinical practice, namely, HRQOL, IADL disability, and depressive symptoms, were significant correlates of frailty. Redefining the frailty phenotype may be needed to improve risk stratification for KT recipients.},

abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia are common conditions in the outpatient setting, but their independent and additive effects on physical capacity have not been well characterized. The association of CKD and anemia with self-reported physical function was evaluated and exercise capacity was measured in patients with coronary disease. A cross-sectional study of 954 outpatients enrolled in the Heart and Soul study was performed. CKD was defined as a measured creatinine clearance {\textless}60 ml/min, and anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level of {\textless}12g/dl. Physical function was self-assessed using the physical limitation subscale of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (0 to 100), and exercise capacity was defined as metabolic equivalent tasks achieved at peak exercise. In unadjusted analyses, CKD was associated with lower self-reported physical function (67.6 versus 74.9; P {\textless} 0.001) and lower exercise capacity (5.5 versus 7.9; P {\textless} 0.001). Similarly, anemia was associated with lower self-reported physical function (62.6 versus 74.3; P {\textless} 0.001) and exercise capacity (5.7 versus 7.5; P {\textless} 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, CKD (69.4 versus 74.2; P = 0.003) and anemia (67.5 versus 73.6; P = 0.009) each remained associated with lower mean self-reported physical function. In addition, patients with CKD (6.3 versus 7.7; P {\textless} 0.001) or anemia (6.5 versus 7.4; P = 0.004) had lower adjusted mean exercise capacities. Participants with both CKD and anemia had lower self-reported physical function and exercise capacity than those with either alone. CKD and anemia are independently associated with physical limitation and reduced exercise capacity in outpatients with coronary disease, and these effects are additive. The broad impact of these disease conditions merits further study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established. METHODS: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty status. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49 (36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of participants were frail and 43{\%} were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for eGFR {\textgreater}60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61 points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR {\textless}15 (p {\textless} 0.01 for all comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p = 0.002) and eGFR {\textless}15 (OR 4.83; p {\textless} 0.001) were associated with worse frailty status compared with eGFR {\textgreater}60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). CONCLUSIONS: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted interventions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING {\&} PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) {\textless}90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy. MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was 51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0{\%}) was twice that of the much older non-CKD reference population (P {\textless} 0.01). The most common frailty components were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes, eGFR(cys) categories of {\textless}30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a 2.8- (95{\%} CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of frailty compared with GFR(cys) {\textgreater}/=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was associated with an estimated 2.5 (95{\%} CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or dialysis therapy. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal relationships between CKD and frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty has been defined as a tool to define individuals who lack functional reserve and are at risk for functional decline. We hypothesized that chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) would be associated with a greater prevalence of frailty and disability in the elderly. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data collected from the Cardiovascular Health Study, which enrolled 5,888 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older from 4 clinical centers in the United States. Renal insufficiency is defined as a serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL or greater ({\textgreater} or =115 micromol/L) in women and 1.5 mg/dL or greater ({\textgreater} or =133 micromol/L) in men. Frailty is defined by the presence of 3 of the following abnormalities: unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, measured weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Disability is defined as any self-reported difficulty with activities of daily living. RESULTS: Among 5,808 participants with creatinine levels measured at entry, 15.9{\%} of men (n = 394) and 7.6{\%} of women (n = 254) had CRI. Prevalences of frailty (15{\%} versus 6{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001) and disability (12{\%} versus 7{\%}; P = 0.001) were greater in participants with CRI compared with those with normal renal function. After multivariate adjustment for comorbidity, CRI remained significantly associated with frailty (odds ratio, 1.76; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.41), but not disability (odds ratio, 1.26; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.69). CONCLUSION: Elderly persons with CRI have a high prevalence of frailty, which may signal their risk for progression to adverse health outcomes. If confirmed in other studies, identification of frailty in patients with CRI may warrant special interventions to preserve their independence, quality of life, and survival.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty, a manifestation of unsuccessful aging, is highly prevalent in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with comorbid conditions in cross-sectional studies. Longitudinal studies investigating the progression of frailty in those with advanced non-dialysis CKD are lacking. OBJECTIVES: Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial (CanFIT). To determine the natural history, prevalence of perceived and measured frailty and its association with dialysis treatment choices and adverse outcomes in patients with advanced CKD. DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study, designed to collect data from 600 participants over 2 years. SETTING: Interprofessional non-dialysis CKD clinics at four tertiary health care centres in central Canada. PATIENTS: People with CKD stage 4 and 5 (eGFR {\textless}30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) who are not on dialysis at enrollment. MEASUREMENTS: Multiple Frailty Definitions: Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Fried Frailty Criteria, Frailty Index. Dialysis start: In-Centre Hemodialysis, Home Hemodialysis or Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes: Death, Opt-out or Lost to follow up. METHODS: We will perform physical and cognitive assessments annually. We plan to analyze the relationships between frailty, treatment choices and patient centered outcomes. RESULTS: We have recruited 217 participants in 2 centres; of these, 56 {\%} had reduced physical function at baseline, as defined by the SPPB. Risk of reduced physical function was 8 fold higher in those with diabetes after adjusting for age, gender, eGFR and comorbidities. LIMITATIONS: Referred population, use of SPPB as a measure of frailty, inter-operator variability in measurement of hand grip and gait speed, cross-sectional analysis of baseline data in the subset recruited to date. CONCLUSIONS: People with advanced CKD have a high burden of reduced physical function, especially those with diabetes. We will continue enrollment into the CanFIT study to further understand the clinical history of CKD and frailty in this population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the association between frailty and chronic kidney disease. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8{\%}. However, among persons with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate {\textless} 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9{\%} were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection remain elusive.},
