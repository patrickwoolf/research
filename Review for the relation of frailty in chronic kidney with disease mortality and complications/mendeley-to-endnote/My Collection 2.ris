N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - Older adults (aged ≥65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging. Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death. Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to identify opportunities to intervene.

Frailty was independently associated with delirium (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 4.13; P=0.04), but premorbid global cognitive function was not. Recipients with delirium had increased risks of ≥2-week length of stay (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 2.76 to 10.66; P
N2  - Background Frail kidney transplant (KT) recipients may be particularly vulnerable to surgical stressors, resulting in delirium and subsequent adverse outcomes. We sought to identify the incidence, risk factors, and sequelae of post-KT delirium.Methods We studied 125,304 adult KT recipients (1999-2014) to estimate delirium incidence in national registry claims. Additionally, we used a validated chart abstraction algorithm to identify post-KT delirium in 893 adult recipients (2009-2017) from a cohort study of frailty. Delirium sequelae were identified using adjusted logistic regression (length of stay ≥2 weeks and institutional discharge [skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility]) and adjusted Cox regression (death-censored graft loss and mortality).Results Only 0.8% of KT recipients had a delirium claim. In the cohort study, delirium incidence increased with age (18-49 years old: 2.0%; 50-64 years old: 4.6%; 65-75 years old: 9.2%; and ≥75 years old: 13.8%) and frailty (9.0% versus 3.9%); 20.0% of frail recipients aged ≥75 years old experienced delirium. Frailty was independently associated with delirium (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 4.13; P=0.04), but premorbid global cognitive function was not. Recipients with delirium had increased risks of ≥2-week length of stay (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 2.76 to 10.66; P<0.001), institutional discharge (OR, 22.41; 95% CI, 7.85 to 63.98; P<0.001), graft loss (hazard ratio [HR], 2.73; 95% CI, 1.14 to 6.53; P=0.03), and mortality (HR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.76 to 5.54; P<0.001).Conclusions Post-KT delirium is a strong risk factor for subsequent adverse outcomes, yet it is a clinical entity that is often missed.

N2  - OBJECTIVE Frailty is associated with increased vulnerability to poor health. There is growing interest in understanding the association between frailty and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review explored how frailty is measured in patients with CKD and the association between frailty and adverse outcomes across different stages of renal impairment. STUDY DESIGN Systematic analysis of peer reviewed articles. DATA SOURCES Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane were used to identify the articles. DATA SYNTHESIS Articles published before the 17th of September 2016, that measured frailty in patients with CKD was eligible for the systematic review. Two independent researchers assessed the eligibility of the articles. Quality of the articles was assessed using the Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument. RESULTS The literature search yielded 540 articles, of which 32 met the study criteria and were included in the review (n=36,076, age range: 50–83 years). Twenty-three (72%) studies used or adapted the Fried phenotype to measure frailty. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 7% in community-dwellers (CKD Stages 1–4) to 73% in a cohort of patients on haemodialysis. The incidence of frailty increased with reduced glomerular filtration rate. Frailty was associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization. CONCLUSION Frailty is prevalent in patients with CKD and it is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. There are differences in the methods used to assess frailty and this hinders comparisons between studies.

N2  - This is a prospective cohort study to assess the prevalence of frailty in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) under the government-funded scheme at our center and to assess the relationship between frailty and falls, hospitalizations, and mortality. This was done at our center which is completely supported by the government, which provides HD to all the patients under poverty line. Epidemiological data, anthropometric measurements, comorbidities assessment, frailty assessment using Fried criteria, subsequent hospitalizations, falls, and mortality were recorded in our prevalent dialysis population at our center between October 2014 and October 2015. Two hundred and twenty-six patients were enrolled during this period. Twenty-one patients were excluded as they did not satisfy the inclusion criteria. Two hundred and five prospective patients were studied for the predictors of frailty. Frailty was present in 82% of the study population. Mean age of our study population was 44.95 +/- 13.27 years. On univariate analysis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (HTN), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), smoking, hepatitis C, inadequate dialysis, intradialytic hypotension (IDH), interdialytic weight gain, low serum creatinine <4 mg/dL, and anemia (Hb <10 g/dL) were found to be statistically significantly different between frail and nonfrail groups On multivariate regression analysis, only HTN, PVD, CVA, anemia, smoking, and IDH were found to be significant. Frailty is highly prevalent among dialysis population. Factors predicting frailty include HTN, smoking, LVD, PVD, CVA, smoking, anemia, and IDH.

N1  - Cause of frailty: lower testosterone.
N2  - Background Despite the high prevalence of frailty among patients receiving hemodialysis, few preventable or treatable contributing causes have been identified. Hypogonadism is also common in this population and low serum testosterone concentrations share several clinical phenotypes with frailty. We hypothesized that low serum testosterone concentrations would be associated with frailty and several of its individual components. Methods We used data from 440 men from A Cohort Study To Investigate the Value of Exercise in ESRD/Analysis Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in ESRD, a longitudinal study that recruited participants from 14 dialysis centers in Atlanta, GA and the San Francisco, CA Bay Area from 2009 to 2011. We assessed frailty using the Fried Frailty Phenotype. We examined the association between free testosterone (as a continuous and dichotomous variable) and frailty, individual frailty components, sarcopenia, lower extremity function and muscle mass estimation by creatinine and body impedance spectroscopy over 12 months using generalized estimating equations. Results The mean age was 56.1 ± 14.2 years and 27% were white. A 50% lower concentration of free testosterone was associated with 1.40-fold higher odds of being frail [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.53] and 1.40-fold higher odds of becoming frail over 12 months (95% CI 1.07-1.73). This association was mainly due to an association with two components of frailty: grip strength and gait speed. In addition, 50% lower free testosterone concentration was associated with a 1.55-fold higher odds of having sarcopenia (95% CI 1.09-2.02) and 1.72-fold higher odds for developing sarcopenia (95% CI 1.13-2.33) as well as with lower muscle mass and a decrease in muscle mass over 12 months as estimated by serum creatinine and by bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy. Conclusion Serum free testosterone concentration was associated with frailty, physical function, sarcopenia and muscle mass as well as with changes in these outcomes over 12 months. Testosterone replacement may be a feasible therapeutic target toward prevention of frailty, although clinical trials are needed to test this possibility.

The patients were divided into 3 groups according to frailty scores: 39 (53%) patients were frail, 6 (8%) patients were intermediately frail, and 28 (39%) patients were normal. Significant differences were found for 25-hydroxy vitamin D and hemoglobin levels among the groups; however, no differences were observed in body mass index, comorbidities, sex, marital status, education, disease and dialysis durations, or parathyroid hormone, creatinine, serum calcium, phosphorus, and potassium levels.
N2  - OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of frailty and the association of vitamin D levels and the frailty phenotype among non-geriatric dialysis patients. METHOD Seventy-four stable, chronic hemodialysis patients from the hemodialysis unit of the hospital were enrolled in the study. The patients' medical histories and laboratory findings were obtained from the medical records of the dialysis unit. Serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were determined using chemiluminometric immunoassays. Frailty was defined by Fried et al. as a phenotype; shrinking, weakness, self-reported exhaustion, decreased activity and slowed walking speed were evaluated. RESULTS Forty-one (55%) of the patients were males. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to frailty scores: 39 (53%) patients were frail, 6 (8%) patients were intermediately frail, and 28 (39%) patients were normal. Significant differences were found for 25-hydroxy vitamin D and hemoglobin levels among the groups; however, no differences were observed in body mass index, comorbidities, sex, marital status, education, disease and dialysis durations, or parathyroid hormone, creatinine, serum calcium, phosphorus, and potassium levels. CONCLUSIONS Weakness and slowness are serious outcomes of both vitamin D deficiency and frailty, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risks of decreased physical activity, falls, fractures and death in postmenopausal women and older men. Although studies on frailty have focused on older adults, growing evidence indicates that the frailty phenotype is becoming a factor associated with poor health outcomes in non-geriatric populations with chronic disease.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - Purpose of review—Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here. Recent findings—The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD stages and eventually reverses in form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy supplementation combined with low-protein diet (LPD) for the management of CKD may prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to LPD, but dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis therapy. Phosphorous burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum bicarbonate concentration is normal range and ≥23 mEq/L for non-dialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven. Summary—Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing comorbidities.

N1  - review
N2  - Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition) due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition, comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW. © 2013.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of\nadults, affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid\ndiseases are encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of\nthyroid diseases may overlap with what is considered to be ``normal\naging,{''} the presence of a thyroid disorder may go undiagnosed in the\nelderly. This potential problem is further compounded in elderly\npatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an\nunderlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously\nattributed to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney\ndisease. Frailty is being recognized as a contributing factor to the\npoor outcomes (hospitalization and high mortality) in elderly patients\nwith CKD. Predisposing factors leading to frailty in elderly with CKD\nsuch as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low testosterone,\nsarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal\nabnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question\nof whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes\nin elderly CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible\ncauses of frailty. In this review, we will focus on the associations\nbetween thyroid hormone abnormalities and the predisposing factors of\nfrailty in elderly patients with CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of\nthyroid hormone abnormalities and factors predisposing to frailty in CKD\npatients is established, identification and treatment of thyroid\nabnormalities in this population would assume increased importance.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - Frailty is associated with a pro-inflammatory state, which has been characterized by elevated levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers, but has not been related to the number of co-existing chronic diseases associated with inflammation. We sought to determine the extent to which a higher number of inflammatory-related diseases is associated with frailty and to identify the most common disease patterns associated with being frail in older adults. We performed binomial regression analyses to assess whether a higher count of inflammatory-related diseases increases the probability of frailty using data from the WHAS I and II, companion cohorts composed of 70-79-year-old community-dwelling older women in Baltimore, Maryland (n= 620). An increase of one inflammatory-related disease was associated log-linearly with frailty (Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 2.28, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.81-2.87). After adjusting for age, race, education, and smoking status, the probability of frailty remained significant (PR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.52-2.55). In the frail population, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and depressive symptoms (Prevalence = 22.9%, 95%CI = 14.2-34.8%); CVD and depressive symptoms (21.7%, 95%CI = 13.2-33.5%); CKD and anemia (18.7%, 95%CI = 11.1-29.7%); cardiovascular disease (CVD), CKD, and pulmonary disease (10.7%, 95%CI = 5.2-21.0%); CKD, anemia, and depressive symptoms (8.7%, 95%CI = 3.9-18.2%); and CVD, anemia, pulmonary disease, and depressive symptoms (5.0%, 95%CI = 1.6-14.4%) were among the most frequent disease combinations. Their prevalence percentages were significantly higher in the frail versus non-frail women. A higher inflammatory-related disease count, perhaps reflecting a greater pro-inflammatory burden, increases the likelihood of frailty. Shared mechanisms among specific disease combinations may further contribute to this risk. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

frail recipients had worse physical (P &lt; 0.001) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (P = 0.001), but similar mental HRQOL (P = 0.43). Frail recipients experienced sig8nificantly greater rates of improvement in physical HRQOL (frail, 1.35 points/month; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-2.05; nonfrail, 0.34 points/month; 95% CI, −0.17-0.85; P = 0.02) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (frail, 3.75 points/month; 95% CI, 2.89-4.60; nonfrail, 2.41 points/month; 95% CI, 1.78-3.04; P = 0.01), but no difference in mental HRQOL (frail, 0.54 points/month; 95% CI, −0.17-1.25; nonfrail, 0.46 points/month; 95% CI, −0.06-0.98; P = 0.85) post-KT.
N2  - BACKGROUND Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reflects a patient's disease burden, treatment effectiveness, and health status and is summarized by physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific scales among end-stage renal disease patients. Although on average HRQOL improves postkidney transplant (KT), the degree of change depends on the ability of the patient to withstand the stressor of dialysis versus the ability to tolerate the intense physiologic changes of KT. Frail KT recipients may be extra vulnerable to either of these stressors, thus affecting change in HRQOL after KT. METHODS We ascertained frailty, as well as physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific HRQOL in a multicenter prospective cohort of 443 KT recipients (May 2014 to May 2017) using Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short Form. We quantified the short-term (3 months) rate of post-KT HRQOL change by frailty status using adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models. RESULTS Mean HRQOL scores at KT were 43.3 (SD, 9.6) for physical, 52.8 (SD, 8.9) for mental, and 72.6 (SD, 12.8) for kidney disease-specific HRQOL; frail recipients had worse physical (P < 0.001) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (P = 0.001), but similar mental HRQOL (P = 0.43). Frail recipients experienced significantly greater rates of improvement in physical HRQOL (frail, 1.35 points/month; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-2.05; nonfrail, 0.34 points/month; 95% CI, -0.17-0.85; P = 0.02) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (frail, 3.75 points/month; 95% CI, 2.89-4.60; nonfrail, 2.41 points/month; 95% CI, 1.78-3.04; P = 0.01), but no difference in mental HRQOL (frail, 0.54 points/month; 95% CI, -0.17-1.25; nonfrail, 0.46 points/month; 95% CI, -0.06-0.98; P = 0.85) post-KT. CONCLUSIONS Despite decreased physiologic reserve, frail recipients experience improvement in post-KT physical and kidney disease-specific HRQOL better than nonfrail recipients.

Many comorbidities with frailty
N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Patients of all ages undergoing hemodialysis (HD) have a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and worse cognitive function than healthy controls, and those with dementia are at high risk of death. Frailty has been associated with poor cognitive function in older adults without kidney disease. We hypothesized that frailty might also be associated with poor cognitive function in adults of all ages undergoing HD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS At HD initiation, 324 adults enrolled (November 2008 to July 2012) in a longitudinal cohort study (Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in ESRD) were classified into three groups (frail, intermediately frail, and nonfrail) based on the Fried frailty phenotype. Global cognitive function (3MS) and speed/attention (Trail Making Tests A and B [TMTA and TMTB, respectively]) were assessed at cohort entry and 1-year follow-up. Associations between frailty and cognitive function (at cohort entry and 1-year follow-up) were evaluated in adjusted (for sex, age, race, body mass index, education, depression and comorbidity at baseline) linear (3MS, TMTA) and Tobit (TMTB) regression models. RESULTS At cohort entry, the mean age was 54.8 years (SD 13.3), 56.5% were men, and 72.8% were black. The prevalence of frailty and intermediate frailty were 34.0% and 37.7%, respectively. The mean 3MS was 89.8 (SD 7.6), TMTA was 55.4 (SD 29), and TMTB was 161 (SD 83). Frailty was independently associated with lower cognitive function at cohort entry for all three measures (3MS: -2.4 points; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -4.2 to -0.5; P=0.01; TMTA: 12.1 seconds; 95% CI, 4.7 to 19.4; P<0.001; and TMTB: 33.2 seconds; 95% CI, 9.9 to 56.4; P=0.01; all tests for trend, P<0.001) and with worse 3MS at 1-year follow-up (-2.8 points; 95% CI, -5.4 to -0.2; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS In adult incident HD patients, frailty is associated with worse cognitive function, particularly global cognitive function (3MS).

Frail participants had lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more depression (p=&lt;0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p&lt;0.05). No differences in health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail participants (p&gt;0.05).
N2  - Objectives: Frailty can cause increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, such as falls, fractures, depression and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition, HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5). Methods: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale); depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools. Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights >136 kg, and coinciding comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded. Results: Frailty occurred in 17% of participants (n=7). Frail participants had lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more depression (p=<0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p<0.05). No differences in health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail participants (p>0.05). Conclusions: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.

cause
N2  - Studies of frailty among patients on hemodialysis have relied on definitions that substitute self-reported functioning for measures of physical performance and omit weight loss or substitute alternate criteria. We examined the association between body composition and a definition of frailty that includes measured physical performance and weight loss in a cross-sectional analysis of 638 adult patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis at 14 centers. Frailty was defined as having three of following characteristics: weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed. We performed logistic regression with body mass index (BMI) and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS)-derived estimates of intracellular water (ICW), fat mass, and extracellular water (ECW) as the main predictors, and age, sex, race, and comorbidity as covariates. Overall, 30% of participants were frail. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.31 per 10 years; 95%confidence interval [95% CI],1.14 to 1.50), diabetes (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.40), higherfat mass (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02to 1.37), and higher ECW (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47) associated with higher odds of frailty. Higher ICW associated with lower odds of frailty (OR, 0.80 per kg; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.87). The addition of BMI data did not change the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC; AUC=0.66 versus 0.66; P=0.71), but the addition of BIS data did change the AUC (AUC=0.72; P<0.001). Thus, individual components of body composition but not BMI associate strongly with frailty in this cohort of patients receiving hemodialysis.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms and the interventions.

METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.

RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.

CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease.

N2  - Nephrologists have focused on the uremic syndrome as an indication for dialysis. The elderly frail renal patient approaching ESRD represents a complex biologic system that is already failing. This patient phenotype exhibits progressive geriatric disabilities and dependence interspersed with shrinking periods of stability regardless of whether dialysis is started. Consequently, the frail renal patient faces challenging treatment choices underpinned by ethical tensions. Identifying the advanced frail renal patient and optimizing the shared decision-making process will enable him or her to make well informed choices based on an understanding of his or her overall condition and personal values and preferences. This approach will also permit nephrologists to fulfill their ethical obligations to respect patient autonomy, promote patient benefit, and minimize patient harm.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of falls, with subsequent complications including fractures, loss of independence, hospitalization, and institutionalization. Factors associated with falls are poorly understood in this population. We hypothesized that insights derived from studies of the elderly might apply to adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis; we focused on frailty, a phenotype of physiological decline strongly associated with falls in the elderly. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study of 95 patients undergoing hemodialysis (1/2009-3/2010), the association of frailty with future falls was explored using adjusted Poisson regression. Frailty was classified using the criteria established by Fried et al., as a combination of five components: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed. RESULTS: Over a median 6.7-month period of longitudinal follow-up, 28.3% of study participants (25.9% of those under 65, 29.3% of those 65 and older) experienced a fall. After adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidity, disability, number of medications, marital status, and education, frailty independently predicted a 3.09-fold (95% CI: 1.38-6.90, P=0.006) higher number of falls. This relationship between frailty and falls did not differ for younger and older adults (P=0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, a validated construct in the elderly, was a strong and independent predictor of falls in adults undergoing hemodialysis, regardless of age. Our results may aid in identifying frail hemodialysis patients who could be targeted for multidimensional fall prevention strategies.

N2  - Needing assistance with activities of daily living (ADL) is an early indicator of functional decline and has important implications for individuals' quality of life. However, correlates of need for ADL assistance have received limited attention among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD). A multicenter cohort of 742 prevalent HD patients was assessed in 2009-2011 and classified as frail, prefrail and nonfrail by the Fried frailty index (recent unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk speed, low physical activity). Patients reported need for assistance with 4 ADL tasks and identified contributing symptoms/conditions (pain, balance, endurance, weakness, others). Nearly 1 in 5 patients needed assistance with 1 or more ADL. Multivariable analysis showed increased odds for needing ADL assistance among frail (odds ratio [OR] 11.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.50-23.41; P <0.001) and prefrail (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.01-3.68; P = 0.046) compared with non-frail patients. In addition, the odds for needing ADL assistance were lower among blacks compared with whites and were higher among patients with diabetes, lung disease, and stroke. Balance, weakness, and "other" (frequently dialysis-related) symptoms/conditions were the most frequently named reasons for ADL difficulty. In addition to interventions such as increasing physical activity that might delay or reverse the process of frailty, the immediate symptoms/conditions to which individuals attribute their ADL difficulty may have clinical relevance for developing targeted management and/or treatment approaches.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013). PREDICTORS: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio. OUTCOME: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical activity). RESULTS: 341 (7%) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30%) had eGFRcr<60mL/min/1.73m(2), 2,480 (50%) had eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m(2), and 1,006 (20%) had albuminuria with albumin excretion >/= 30mg/g. Among frail participants, prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m(2) were 45% and 77%, respectively. Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals with eGFRcr of 60 to <75mL/min/1.73m(2) were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR categories using eGFRcys (49% to 45-<60, 32% to 30-<45, and 3% to <30mL/min/1.73m(2)). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking >/=10 classes of medications) was more common in frail individuals (54% vs 38% of nonfrail), including classes requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants). LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design. CONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this vulnerable population.

In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
N2  - Background Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical outcomes. Methods We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes. Results We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88]. Conclusions CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with clinical outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty increases early hospital readmission and mortality risk among kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. Although frailty represents a high-risk state for this population, the correlates of frailty, the patterns of the 5 frailty components, and the risk associated with these patterns are unclear. METHODS: Six hundred sixty-three KT recipients were enrolled in a cohort study of frailty in transplantation (12/2008-8/2015). Frailty, activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) disability, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale depression, education, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were measured. We used multinomial regression to identify frailty correlates. We identified which patterns of the 5 components were associated with mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 19.5%. Older recipients (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.07) were more likely to be frail. The only other factors that were independently associated with frailty were IADL disability (PR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.72-6.06), depressive symptoms (PR, 11.31; 95% CI, 4.02-31.82), less than a high school education (PR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.30-7.36), and low HRQOL (fair/poor: PR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.48-9.31). The most common pattern was poor grip strength, low physical activity, and slowed walk speed (19.4%). Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged as having an association with post-KT mortality. KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed walking speed (hazards ratio = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.17-5.03) and poor grip strength, exhaustion, and slowed walking speed (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.14-5.97) were at increased mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty among KT recipients; however, factors rarely measured as part of clinical practice, namely, HRQOL, IADL disability, and depressive symptoms, were significant correlates of frailty. Redefining the frailty phenotype may be needed to improve risk stratification for KT recipients.

The first year after inclusion, 30% of patients with a GFI ≥ 4 died, compared to 9% of fit patients (p = 0.04). Moreover, 90% of frail patients had been hospitalized one or more times, compared to 53% in the fit group (p = 0.005).
N2  - BACKGROUND: Currently over 55% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are aged ≥60 years and patients >75 years represent the fastest growing segment of the dialysis population. We aimed to assess whether the Groningen frailty indicator (GFI) can be used to distinguish fit older ESRD patients, likely able to tolerate and benefit from dialysis, from frail older patients who need further evaluation with a geriatrician's comprehensive assessment.

METHODS: All patients aged ≥65 years visiting the pre-dialysis unit at the Gelre hospital between 2007 and 2013 were included and underwent the GFI (n = 65). Patients with GFI ≥ 4 (frail) were referred for geriatric consultation (n = 13). Results of the GFI and nephrologists' evaluation were compared with geriatrician's assessment. Survival rates and outcomes after one year of follow up were recorded.

RESULTS: Twenty patients (32%) were identified as frail. Of the problems identified by the geriatrician in 13 patients, 55% were not reported in the nephrologists' notes. The first year after inclusion, 30% of patients with a GFI ≥ 4 died, compared to 9% of fit patients (p = 0.04). Moreover, 90% of frail patients had been hospitalized one or more times, compared to 53% in the fit group (p = 0.005).

CONCLUSION: Although the GFI can be a useful instrument to identify ESRD patients at risk, both the GFI and the nephrologists' assessment failed to identify specific geriatric impairments. Further research is needed to develop a specific frailty indicator for ESRD patients and to determine the value and effect of a comprehensive geriatric assessment in ESRD patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between earlier dialysis initiation and mortality. METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73%. In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25-1.97]; P < .001) and time to first hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45]; P < .001). While higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation. Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The risk of herpes zoster in the dialysis population relative to the  general population is not known. The aim of this study was to perform a population-based cohort study to investigate the risk of herpes zoster after the initiation of hemodialysis therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Taiwan, a country with the highest incidence of ESRD in the world. STUDY DESIGN: Matched cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. 843 patients who were beginning hemodialysis therapy in 1999-2003 were included as the study cohort and 3,372 patients without ESRD matched for age and sex were included as a comparison cohort. A multivariate frailty Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to adjust for confounding and compare the 6-year herpes zoster-free survival rate between these 2 cohorts. PREDICTORS: Hemodialysis. OUTCOMES: Herpes zoster. RESULTS: Mean years of follow-up were 4.73 and 5.49 for the hemodialysis and comparison cohorts, respectively. 868 patients developed herpes zoster throughout the study period, 294 from the hemodialysis cohort and 574 from the comparison cohort. The incidence rate of herpes zoster (73.34 events/1,000 person-year) was significantly higher in the hemodialysis cohort than in the control cohort (31.03 events/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for potential confounders, the adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.72-2.27). LIMITATIONS: We expect that some patients with mild zoster chose not to seek medical help. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients treated with long-term hemodialysis are at an increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability, institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

N2  - Objective: Frailty among the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population is highly prevalent and has been associated with mortality. Little is known about the relation of different aspects of body composition, a modifiable risk factor, with the risk of frailty in ESRD population.Design and Methods: One hundred and fifty-one patients including 85 men and 66 women, aged ≥18 years with ESRD who had been receiving conventional maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for at least 3 months were included. Body fat and muscle mass from both bioimpedance spectroscopy and skin-fold thickness and waist circumference as a surrogate of abdominal obesity were measured. Frailty was defined based on Fried's criteria. Health-related quality of life was collected using the RAND version of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36) Survey.Results: We performed single and multiple predictor logistic regression analyses to determine factors associated with frailty. After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, fat mass (both by bioimpedance spectroscopy and anthropometry) and waist circumference, but not muscle mass remained the main predictors of frailty. The odds ratio of frailty in the third tertile compared with the first was 4.97 (1.70-14.55) and 3.84 (1.39-10.61) for fat mass and waist circumference, respectively (P for trends for both <.05). The scores of physical health and kidney disease effect component of quality of life were lower in frail compared with nonfrail patients (40.7 ± 9.2 vs. 33.7 ± 10.2, P < .01 and 66.8 ± 22.4 vs. 51.6 ± 25.7, P < .05 for physical health and effects of disease, respectively).Conclusions: Frailty, which is associated with poor outcomes in chronic HD patients, is common and predicted by fat mass and waist circumference but not by body mass index and muscle mass. Interventions to modify abdominal obesity, reflected by waist circumference, could potentially lower the incidence of frailty and hence improve the quality of life in the HD population.

N2  - The incidence of psychopathology, particularly depression, is high in
dialysed elderly patients whereas their perceived level of health in the
mental domain is similar to that of a non-dialysed and, even younger,
population.
Although the losses associated with advancing years, chronic disease and
then entry into dialysis renders the psyche of elderly people frail,
they do not strictly add in negative terms: their psychological reserve
or resignation helps very elderly people to tolerate dialysis and its
constraints.
However, maintaining functional autonomy (ability to provide for one's
fundamental needs and preserve leisure activities) while remaining
independent to take decisions (particularly in controlling ways of
receiving assistance) and preserving close relationships emerge as major
determinant factors of the quality of life of very elderly dialysed
patients. Added to the dependency due to dialysis, losses in these
domains very often represent a turning point by changing the patient's
identity, predisposing to the development of relationship problems,
leading the patient to question his self-esteem or even resulting in
psychological dependency, which itself adversely affects the quality of
life.
These mechanisms of psychopathology may not hide the possibility of an
underlying dementia.

N2  - Background: Frail obese community-dwelling older adults are at increased mortality risk. Among hemodialysis (HD) patients, frailty is common and associated with increased mortality risk; however, in dialysis, obesity is associated with decreased mortality risk. Whether the frail-obese phenotype is associated with increased mortality risk among HD patients remains unclear.; Methods: This study included 370 incident HD patients enrolled in the Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End Stage Renal Disease (PACE) study. We measured frailty using the Fried phenotype, general obesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2] and abdominal obesity [waist:hip ratio (WHR) ≥median WHR] and estimated their associations with mortality.; Results: The mean age was 55 years, with 42% female, 73% African American, 57% diabetic and 52% frail. Frail HD patients had higher mean BMI (frail = 30.3 kg/m2, non-frail = 28.3 kg/m2; P = 0.02) and similar WHR (P = 0.8). Twenty-two percent were frail with general obesity and 27% were frail with abdominal obesity. Frailty was associated with 1.66-fold increased mortality risk [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.67]. BMI was associated with a decreased mortality risk [25.0-29.9 kg/m2 hazard ratio (HR) 0.53 (95% CI 0.31-0.93); ≥30 kg/m2 HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.19-0.62)]. Frailty was associated with elevated mortality risk among HD patients with general [HR 3.77 (95% CI 1.10-12.92)] and abdominal obesity [HR 2.38 (95% CI 1.17-4.82)]. Frailty was not associated with mortality among HD patients without general or abdominal obesity.; Conclusions: In adults initiating HD, frailty was associated with elevated mortality risk, even among the obese. Frail-obese HD patients may be a high-risk, often-overlooked population, as obesity is assumed to be protective. Measurement of frailty and obesity may facilitate risk stratification.;

N2  - Metformin Associates lactic acidosis (MALA) is a metabolic acidosis with higher anion gap, high levels of blood lactates and treatment by metformin. MALA is a very rare entity but is associated with high mortality (30 to 50%). The extrarenal blood purification may be necessary in emergency. Relatively good clinical tolerance contrasts with a very elevated serum lactate. There is always a trigger and hypovolemia is prevalent. MALA often occurs when its prescription is not indicated (renal failure, cardiac failure, hypovolemia, or patient aged over 80 years). Metformin must be stopped in situations of acute hypovolemia or frail patients as diuretics or blockers of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

N2  - The proposed investigation for this study aims to; 1) understand the prevalence and outcomes associated with frailty among haemodialysis patients; 2) ascertain the best frailty assessment tool for haemodialysis patients, and; 3) design a clinical study to explore the feasibility of facilitating, recruiting and executing a multi‐disciplinary clinical and psychological intervention to improve frailty status among haemodialysis patients. Work package 1: Firstly, there is a need to understand the prevalence and spectrum of frailty in a UK haemodialysis cohort and what impact frailty has for haemodialysis patients. To investigate this, the investigators will approach every patient on haemodialysis within the local catchment of haemodialysis units and, after informed consent, clinically phenotype their frailty status (pre‐ and post‐haemodialysis for calculation of variability). The frailty phenotyping will encompass a number of frailty assessments (including the Edmonton Frail Scale, Clinical Frailty Scale from Rookwood score and Fried Frailty scale) to identify the ideal frailty assessment tool. All patients in this observational cohort study will be prospectively monitored for clinical/biochemical outcomes using an informatics‐based approach for up to 60 months. Work package 2: Building upon the work conducted in work package 1, work package 2 will aim to recruit 50 patients clinically phenotyped with pre‐frailty from work package 1 into a feasibility study exploring a multi‐disciplinary intervention to improve frailty status. Eligible patients, after informed consent, will be randomised into active or passive intervention. The active intervention will involve a dietitian and physiotherapist who have been trained and accredited with cognitive behavior intervention, utilising established behavioral intervention frameworks, to deliver a multi‐disciplinary clinical intervention targeting multiple components of frailty. The FITNESS project will therefore answer some important unanswered questions regarding frailty among the haemodialysis population and help in the design of a large multi‐disciplinary intervention study if deemed feasible.

N2  - As the population ages and diabetes mellitus increases in prevalence, the incidence of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is becoming a disease of older people (aged >/= 75 years). As the epidemiology of diabetes mellitus and DN shifts toward this patient population, the pathogenesis of DN in old age is changing: the pathologic findings suggest ischemia and hypertension, and the classic Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions may be absent. The demographic shift in the epidemiology and the associated changes in pathology because of aging and atherosclerosis will have a significant impact on various aspects related to the disease in old age. This article reviews the authors' current understanding of DN and its implications on clinical management relevant to current guidelines.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: In-center hemodialysis (HD) has been the standard treatment for older dialysis patients, but reports suggest an associated decline in physical and cognitive function. Cross-sectional data suggest that assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD), an alternative treatment, is associated with quality of life (QoL) outcomes that are comparable to in-center HD. We compared longitudinal changes in QoL between modalities. METHODS: We enrolled 106 aPD patients, matched with 100 HD patients from 20 renal centers in England and Northern Ireland. Patients were assessed quarterly for 2 years using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), SF-12 physical and mental scores, symptom score, Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale (IIRS), Barthel's score, and the Renal Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (RTSQ). Mixed model analysis was used to assess the impact of dialysis modality on these outcomes during follow-up. P values were adjusted for multiple significance testing. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed no difference in any of the outcome measures between aPD and HD. Longitudinal trends in outcomes were also not significantly different. Higher age at baseline was associated with lower IIRS and RTSQ scores during follow-up. One-hundred and twenty-five (60.6%) patients dropped out of the study: 59 (28.6%) died, 61 (29.6%) withdrew during follow-up, and 5 (2.5%) were transplanted. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life outcomes in frail older aPD patients were equivalent to those receiving in-center HD. Assisted PD is thus a valid alternative to HD for older people with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) wishing to dialyze at home.

N2  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Frailty, characterized by low physiological
reserves, is strongly associated with vulnerability to adverse outcomes.
Features of frailty overlap with those of advanced heart failure, making
a distinction between them difficult. We sought to determine whether
implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) would decrease
frailty.
DESIGN: Prospective, cohort study.
SETTING: Five academic medical centers.
PARTICIPANTS: Frail individuals (N = 29; mean age 70.6 +/- 5.5, 72.4%
male).
MEASUREMENTS: Frailty, defined as having 3 or more of the Fried frailty
criteria, was assessed before LVAD implantation and 1, 3, and 6 months
after implantation. Other domains assessed included quality of life,
using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire; mood, using the
Patient Health Questionnaire; and cognitive function, using the
Trail-Making Test Part B.
RESULTS: After 6 months, three subjects had died, and one had undergone
a heart transplant; of 19 subjects with serial frailty measures, the
average number of frailty criteria decreased from 3.9 +/- 0.9 at
baseline to 2.8 +/- 1.4 at 6 months (P=.003). Improvements were observed
after 3 to 6 months of LVAD support, although 10 (52.6%) participants
still had 3 or more Fried criteria, and all subjects had at least one at
6 months. Changes in frailty were associated with improvement in QOL but
not with changes in mood or cognition. Higher estimated glomerular
filtration rate at baseline was independently associated with a decrease
in frailty.
CONCLUSION: Frailty decreased in approximately half of older adults with
advanced heart failure after 6 months of LVAD support. Strategies to
enhance frailty reversal in this population are worthy of additional
study.

N2  - The prevalence of aortic valve stenosis (AS) is growing in developed countries because its prevalence increases with age. A growing number of elderly patients are currently referred to specialized centres to be evaluated for potential therapeutic strategies. Indeed, two techniques are nowadays able to treat high-risk AS patients: TAVI and surgical replacement (AVR). It is the purpose of the present review to summarize current knowledge on safety and efficacy of AVR and TAVI in high-risk patients; to focus on some aspects of recently published guidelines; to emphasize the growing importance of pre-operative individual risk assessment, which is considered the real crucial point for patient selection and trial's comparisons. Indeed, it is worth of noting that currently adopted risk-scores do not show satisfactory performances. Accordingly, it becomes of utmost importance to investigate several baseline but still neglected patients' characteristics (e.g. frailty, functional status, co-morbid conditions, etc.), as well as their pathogenetic relationships with interventional results and follow-up prognosis. All these items are emphasized in the present review. Finally, we have tried to anticipate future scenarios in terms of both ongoing clinical trials and improvements of risk-scores.

N2  - Background: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic kidney disease.Methods: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.Results: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.Conclusion: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection remain elusive.

N2  - There is interdependence between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ageing whereby  CKD makes ageing more accelerated and pronounced, whereas ageing accelerates chronic nephropathy's progression. Frailty status catalyzes this spiral, with renal and systemic negative consequences, and this condition can currently be documented by applying already validated clinical scores (frailty phenotype) or physical test (gate speed). Although, nephroprevention strategies are similar between young adult and senior CKD patients, standard targets should be adequate to very old and frail elderly individuals. For this purpose, an original algorithm is here proposed to adjust the conventional nephroprevention strategies to the condition of CKD frail patient (more relaxed targets and tighter control), as well as to prescribe anti-frailty interventions to slow patient's functional decline, hospitalization and mortality.

falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, vascular access failure, and poor quality of life.
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is highly prevalent in the dialysis population and is associated with mortality. Recent studies have suggested that other dialysis outcomes are compromised in frail individuals. While we do not yet have a consensus as to the best measure of frailty, identification of these poor outcomes and their magnitude of association with frailty will help improve prognostication, allow for earlier interventions, and improve provider-to-patient communication. RECENT FINDINGS: The most widely used assessment of frailty is Fried's physical performance criteria. However, regardless of assessment method, frailty remains highly associated with mortality. More recently, frailty has been associated with falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, vascular access failure, and poor quality of life. Recent large cohort studies provide strong evidence that frailty assessment can provide important prognostic information for providers and patients both before and after initiation of dialysis. Trials aimed at improving frailty are limited and show the promise of augmenting quality of life, although more studies are needed to firmly establish mortality benefits. SUMMARY: We underscore the importance of frailty as a prognostic indicator and identify other recently established consequences of frailty. Widespread adoption of frailty assessment remains limited and researchers continue to find ways of simplifying the data collection process. Timely and regular assessment of frailty may allow for interventions that can mitigate the onset of poor outcomes and identify actionable targets for dialysis providers.

N2  - In studies of survival, the hazard function for each individual may depend on observed risk variables but usually not all such variables are known or measurable. This unknown factor of the hazard function is usually termed the individual heterogeneity or frailty. When survival is time to the occurrence of a particular type of event and more than one such time may be obtained for each individual, frailty is a common factor among such recurrence times. A model including frailty is fitted to such repeated measures of recurrence times.

N2  - Often, one gathers together under the denomination "peritoneal dialysis" patients with various clinical profiles. To quantify this "heterogeneity" we analysed the clinical characteristics of 32,975 patients treated by dialysis at 31 December 2008 in 22 French regions, participating to the REIN registry. This cross-sectional study confirms our initial hypothesis of a great heterogeneity of patients' profiles in peritoneal dialysis. As in hemodialysis, there is a gradation between modalities: from assisted continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis which concerns the frailty patients to autonomous automated peritoneal dialysis for more healthy patients, through assisted automated peritoneal dialysis and autonomous continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Given the volume and cost of inpatient care during the last year of life, there is a critical need to identify patterns of dying as a means of planning end-of-life care services, especially for the growing number of older persons who receive services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). METHODS: A retrospective computerized record review was conducted of 20,933 VHA patients who died as inpatients between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002. Diagnoses were aggregated into one of five classification patterns of death and analyzed in terms of health care resource utilization (mean number of inpatient days and cumulative outpatient visits in the year preceding the patient's death). RESULTS: Cancer deaths were the most common (30.4%) followed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (23.2%), cardiopulmonary failure (21.4%), frailty (11.6%), "other" diagnoses (7.3%), and sudden deaths (6.1%). Those with ESRD were more likely to be male and nonwhite (p < 0.05) and those with frailty were more likely to be older and married (p < 0.05). Controlling for demographic variables, those with frailty had the highest number of inpatient days while those with ESRD had the highest number of outpatient visits. Non-married status was associated with more inpatient days, especially among younger decedents. CONCLUSION: As a recognized leader in end-of-life care, the VHA can play a unique role in the development of specific interventions that address the diverse needs of persons with different dying trajectories identified through this research.

支持sarcopenia&amp;acidosis是frailty的原因
N2  - Older people constitute an increasingly greater proportion of patients with advanced CKD, including those patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment. Frailty is a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors that results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and causes vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty is common in elderly CKD patients, and it may be associated with protein-energy wasting (PEW), sarcopenia, dynapenia, and other complications of CKD. Causes of frailty with or without PEW in the elderly with CKD can be classified into three categories: causes primarily caused by aging per se, advanced CKD per se, or a combination of both conditions. Frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients are associated with impaired physical performance, disability, poorer quality of life, and reduced survival. Prevention and treatment of these conditions in the elderly CKD patients often require a multifaceted approach. Here, we examine the causes and consequences of these conditions and examine the interplay between frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients.

N2  - Objective: Greater physical activity is associated with lower risk of
mortality in persons with kidney disease; however, little is known about
the appropriate dose of physical activity among hemodialysis patients.
Here detected the minimum level of habitual physical activity to help
inform interventions aimed at improving outcomes in the dialysis
population.
Design: The design was prospective cohort study.
Subjects: Clinically stable outpatients in a hemodialysis unit from
October 2002 to March 2014 were assessed for their eligibility to be
included in this 7-year prospective cohort study. We used the Youden
index to determine the optimal cutoff points for physical activity. The
prognostic effect of physical activity on survival was estimated by Cox
proportional hazards regression analysis. The number of steps per
nondialysis day was recorded by accelerometer at study entry.
Main Outcome Measure: The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality.
Results: There were 282 participants who had a mean age of 65 +/- 11
years and 45% were female. A total of 56 deaths occurred during the
follow-up period (56 months {[}interquartile range: 29-84 months]). The
cutoff value for the physical activity discriminating those at high risk
of mortality was 3,752 steps. After adjustment for the effect of
confounders, the hazard ratio in the group of <4,000 steps was 2.37
(95% confidence interval: 1.22-4.60, P = .01) compared with the others.
Conclusions: Engaging in physical activity is associated with decreased
mortality risk among hemodialysis patients. Our findings of a
substantial mortality benefit among those who engage in at least 4,000
steps provide a basis for as a minimum initial recommendation kidney
health providers can provide for mobility disability-free hemodialysis
patients. (C) 2017 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. All rights

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - In the age of person-centered care, there is an emphasis on promoting patient autonomy and surrogate decision maker authority in making treatment decisions that are aligned with the patient's priorities and values. As technological advances offer multiple clinical options with various levels and types of risks and benefits, person-centered clinical practice encourages the incorporation of patients' and families' heterogeneous experiences into decisions regarding illness management. In caring for frail elderly adults, clinicians are sometimes faced with situations in which individuals and their surrogate decision-makers request a treatment that the clinicians feel is clinically inappropriate. This article provides a case example of a frail older adult with advanced chronic kidney disease who requests dialysis despite the advice of his nephrologist to pursue conservative management. The four-box approach, which provides clinicians with a structured ethical framework to facilitate informed and ethically justified treatment decisions, is then introduced. By considering the patient's medical indications, preferences, quality of life, and contextual factors, how each consideration plays a unique yet equally important role in informing clinically responsible and person-centered care is illustrated.

evaluate the effect of the different components of frailty on the QoL of people on dialysis.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Many people on dialysis suffer a variety of conditions that can affect frailty (the condition or quality of being frail), such as comorbidities, disabilities, dependence, malnutrition, cognitive impairment and poor social conditions. Frailty is suspected to affect quality of life (QoL). OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of the different components of frailty on the QoL of people on dialysis. METHODS: We enrolled 203 out of 233 prevalent patients on dialysis in the Trieste area of Italy. We applied the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire, Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Subjective Global Assessment scales and Karnofsky Index. In addition we analysed their social conditions. RESULTS: Dependence, malnutrition and disability had a negative role on QoL. Living with family and good social-economic conditions were significantly related to a better QoL. CONCLUSIONS: Dependence, malnutrition, disability, poor social and economic conditions have a significant effect on life quality. The role of comorbidities appears to be less important. Screening of patients, nutritional and functional rehabilitation and prevention of social isolation appear to be indispensable in guaranteeing a satisfactory life quality.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients



N2  - As people age and live for longer they are more likely to develop comorbid conditions including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This paper discusses the treatment options for stage 5 CKD including haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, transplantation or conservative management, also known as supportive care, for those who decide not to undertake dialysis. It also highlights the complexity of offering a treatment such as dialysis, viewed as a requirement to prolong life, without which people will die, which is unable to restore the kidneys to normal function, only substitute for. Dialysis is also an arduous therapy known to shorten life. In the past refusal of dialysis was viewed as akin to suicide and it is not until more recently that the needs and experiences of those who decide not to embark on dialysis have started to be recognized. Clearly dialysis is not suitable for all, particularly those who are frail with multiple comorbidities and so supportive and palliative care may be a more suitable option for some.

N1  - review
N2  - Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of complexity, which is an essential condition for making the organism capable of keeping homeostasis. Thus, senile loss of complexity makes old individuals frail: a syndrome characterized by the presence of shrinking (sarcopenia), weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness, and low physical activity. Moreover, renal ageing progressively leads to a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction, one of the main pharmacokinetic senile changes, which is not detectable by simply evaluating serum urea or creatinine values but measuring or calculating patient's GFR. Finally, current epidemiology has documented that detrimental social-behavioral factors such as low education level, poor financial-resource, depression, and isolation, also influence the onset and progression of chronic diseases, and even overall mortality, particularly in the elderly. Thus, we propose that these 3 variables: frailty phenotype, senile GFR, and detrimental social-behavioral factors, should be considered at time of prescribing drugs or medical procedures in the elderly. Additionally, they should also be considered for following patient's response to prescribed therapies in elderly patients suffering from chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, etc.), or on organ replacement treatments (dialysis and transplantation).

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - The number of elderly patients on maintenance dialysis has rapidly
increased in the past few decades, particularly in developed countries,
imposing a growing burden on dialysis centres. Hence, many nephrologists
and healthcare authorities feel that greater emphasis should be placed
on the promotion of home dialysis therapies such as peritoneal dialysis
(PD) and home haemodialysis (HD). There is currently no general
consensus as to the best dialysis modality for elderly patients with
end-stage renal disease. In-centre HD is predominant in most countries,
although it is widely recognized that PD has several advantages over HD,
including the lack of need for vascular access, continuous slow
ultrafiltration, less interference with patients' lifestyle and lower
costs. Comparisons of outcomes between elderly patients on PD and HD
rely on observational studies, as randomized controlled trials are
lacking. The results of these studies are variable. However, most of
them suggest that survival rates are largely similar between the two
modalities, except for elderly patients with diabetes and/or beyond 1-3
years from dialysis initiation, in which cases HD appears to be
superior. An equally important aspect to consider when choosing dialysis
modality, particularly in this age group, is the quality of life, and in
this regard most studies found no significant differences between PD and
HD. In these circumstances, we believe that dialysis modality selection
should be guided by patient's preference, based on comprehensive and
unbiased information. A multidisciplinary team should review elderly
patients starting on dialysis, aiming to identify possible barriers to
PD and home HD, including physical, visual, cognitive, psychological and
social problems, and to overcome such barriers by adequate care,
education, psychological counselling and dialysis assistance.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Increasing numbers of frail elderly with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and multiple comorbidities are undertaking dialysis treatment. This has been accompanied by increasing dialysis withdrawal, thus warranting investigation into why this is occurring and whether a different approach to choosing treatment should be implemented. Despite being a potentially life-saving treatment, the physical and psychosocial burdens associated with dialysis in the frail elderly usually outweigh the benefits of correcting uraemia. Conservative management is less invasive and avoids the adverse effects associated with dialysis, but unfortunately it is often not properly considered until patients withdraw from dialysis. Shared decision-making has been proposed to allow patients active participation in healthcare decisions. Through this approach, patients will focus on their personal values to receive appropriate treatment, and perhaps opt for conservative management. This may help address the issue of dialysis withdrawal. Moreover, shared decision-making attempts to resolve the conflict between autonomy and other ethical principles, including physician paternalism. Here, we explore the ethical background behind shared decision-making, and whether it is genuinely in the patient's best interests or whether it is a cynical solution to encourage more patients to consider conservative care, thus saving limited resources.

frail patients had a higher risk of early hospital readmission (adjusted risk ratio 1.61; 95% CI 1.18-2.19).
N2  - The number of patients with end-stage kidney disease 65 years and older is growing, and this growth is expected to continue. The presence of medical comorbidities, limited life expectancy, frailty, and poor functional status in these patients poses substantial challenges in clinical decision-making and provision of optimal care. Frailty is more common in elderly patients with CKD than without and is associated with poor outcomes. Several prognostic tools were developed to estimate the rate of CKD progression among elderly, and risk of mortality after dialysis initiation. Risk factors for CKD progression among elderly include low estimated glomerular filtration rate, high baseline proteinuria, acute kidney injury, low serum albumin, and presence of congestive heart failure. The decision to initiate dialysis in the elderly should take into consideration life expectancy, risks and benefits of each dialysis modality, quality of life, and patient and caregiver preferences. This article discusses common issues in the elderly with end-stage kidney disease, with particular emphasis on the impact of frailty and functional status, choice of dialysis modality and vascular access, and prognosis after dialysis initiation, to assist the nephrologist in making decisions regarding optimal care for this complex group of patients.

the hazard ratio associated with each 1-point increase in the CFS was 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.43; P=0.02).
N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis; however, previous studies have not taken into account the severity of frailty as a predictor of outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess if there was an association between the degree of frailty and mortality among patients on incident dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A cohort study of incident chronic dialysis patients was conducted between January of 2009 and June of 2013 (last follow-up in December of 2013). On the basis of overall clinical impression, the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score was determined for patients at the start of dialysis by their primary nephrologist. This simple scale allocates a single point to different states of frailty (1, very fit; 2, well; 3, managing well; 4, vulnerable; 5, mildly frail; 6, moderately frail; 7, severely frail or terminally ill) with an emphasis on function of the assessed individual. The primary outcome was time to death. Patients were censored at the time of transplantation. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 390 patients with completed CFS scores (mean age of 63+/-15 years old). Most were Caucasian (89%) and men (67%), and 30% of patients had ESRD caused by diabetic nephropathy. The median Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 4 (interquartile range =3-6), and the median CFS score was 4 (interquartile range =2-5). There were 96 deaths over 750 patient-years at risk. In an adjusted Cox survival analysis, the hazard ratio associated with each 1-point increase in the CFS was 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.43; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: A higher severity of frailty (as defined by the CFS) at dialysis initiation is associated with higher mortality.

N2  - Hypertension in a nursing home patient is a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher and 130 mm Hg or higher in a patient with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher and 80 mm Hg or higher in a patient with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency. Numerous prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that antihypertensive drug therapy reduces the development of new coronary events, stroke, and congestive heart failure in older persons. The goal of treatment of hypertension in elderly persons is to lower the blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg and to less than 130/80 mm Hg in older persons with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency. Elderly persons with diastolic hypertension should have their diastolic blood pressure reduced to 80 to 85 mm Hg. Diuretics should be used as initial drugs in the treatment of older persons with hypertension and no associated medical conditions. The selection of antihypertensive drug therapy in persons with associated medical conditions depends on their associated medical conditions. If the blood pressure is more than 20/10 mm Hg above the goal blood pressure, drug therapy should be initiated with 2 antihypertensive drugs, one of which should be a thiazide-type diuretic. Other coronary risk factors must be treated in patients with hypertension.

N2  - Background: The Fried frailty phenotype, a measure of physiologic
reserve defined by 5 components (exhaustion, unintentional weight loss,
low physical activity, slow walking speed, and poor grip strength), is
associated with poor outcomes among ESRD patients. However, these 5
components may not fully capture physiologic reserve in this population.
We aimed to ascertain opinions of ESRD clinicians and patients about the
usefulness of the Fried frailty phenotype and interventions to improve
frailty in ESRD patients, and to identify novel components to further
characterize frailty in ESRD.
Methods: Clinicians who treat adults with ESRD completed a 2-round
Delphi study (n = 41 and n = 36, respectively; response rate = 87%).
ESRD patients completed a survey at transplant evaluation (n = 460;
response rate = 81%). We compared clinician and patient opinions on the
constituent components of frailty.
Results: Clinicians were more likely than patients to say that ESRD
makes patients frail (97.6% vs. 60.2%). There was consensus among
clinicians that exhaustion, low physical activity, slow walking speed,
and poor grip strength characterize frailty in ESRD patients; however,
29% of clinicians thought weight loss was not relevant. Patients were
less likely than clinicians to say that the 5 Fried frailty components
were relevant. Clinicians identified 10 new ESRD-specific potential
components including falls (64%), physical decline (61%), and
cognitive impairment (39%). Clinicians (83%) and patients (80%)
agreed that intradialytic foot-peddlers might make ESRD patients less
frail.
Conclusions: There was consensus among clinicians and moderate consensus
among patients that frailty is more common in ESRD. Weight loss was not
seen as relevant, but new components were identified. These findings are
first steps in refining the frailty phenotype and identifying
interventions to improve physiologic reserve specific to ESRD patients.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: detecting chronic kidney disease (CKD) may have important implications for the management of older and frail people. We aimed at investigating whether clinical setting (nursing home: NH versus hospital: H) affects the agreement between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values estimated by Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), Cockcroft-Gault (CG) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equations. DESIGN: observational study. SETTING: comparison between NH residents and H patients. SUBJECTS: we used data from 177 NH residents, and 439 H patients. METHODS: the agreement between estimating equations and the odds of a discrepancy >25% between formulas in relation to setting (NH versus H) were investigated. RESULTS: the agreement between MDRD and CKD-EPI formulas was good either in NH (k = 0.82) or H (k = 0.87) patients, while corresponding figures for CG indicate only a fair agreement with CKD-EPI (k = 0.50 for both populations). Setting (NH versus H) was associated with discordance between MDRD and CKD-EPI (OR = 3.97; 95% CI = 1.75-9.01), but not between CG and EPI (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.87-1.81). CONCLUSIONS: in NH residents, MDRD and CKD-EPI formulas yield highly concordant GFR values, but CG behaves differently in up to one-third of patients. Such findings have important implications in dosing drugs cleared by the kidney. Setting should be taken into consideration in studies for validation of GFR equations.

N2  - Objectives
To determine whether higher cystatin C would be associated with greater
frailty in men aged 65 and older.
Design
Cross-sectional cohort study.
Setting
Six U.S. sites.
Participants
A random sample of community-dwelling men aged 65 and older enrolled in
the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study (mean age 73.8; 9.8%
frail and 47.2% intermediate frailty; N = 1,602).
Measurements
Serum cystatin C, creatinine, and frailty were measured. Frailty was
analyzed as an ordinal outcome of robust, intermediate frailty, and
frail using a multinomial logistic regression model, and the base model
was adjusted for age, race, and clinical site.
Results
Higher cystatin C was associated with seven times greater odds of being
frail than being robust (odds ratio (OR) quartile 4 vs 1 = 7.12, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 3.76-13.46) and 2.4 times greater odds of
intermediate frailty than robust (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 2.38, 95% CI =
1.70-3.32). The association was attenuated but persisted after adjusting
for multiple possible confounders. In contrast, neither higher serum
creatinine (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.36, 95% CI = 0.78-2.40) nor lower
creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR quartile 4 vs
1 = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.54-1.87) was associated in a graded manner with
greater odds of frailty.
Conclusion
Higher cystatin C, but not creatinine-based measures, was associated
with greater odds of frailty in this cohort of older men.

N2  - Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for in-hospital treatment of severe infections. Acute neurotoxicity, an increasingly recognized adverse effect of this drug in an overdose, predominantly affects patients with reduced renal function. Although dialytic approaches have been advocated to treat this condition, their role in this indication remains unclear. We report the case of an 88-year-old female patient with impaired renal function who developed life-threatening neurologic symptoms during cefepime therapy. She was treated with two intermittent 3-hour high-flux, high-efficiency hemodialysis sessions. Serial pre-, post-, and peridialytic (pre- and postfilter) serum cefepime concentrations were measured. Pharmacokinetic modeling showed that this dialytic strategy allowed for serum cefepime concentrations to return to the estimated nontoxic range 15 hours earlier than would have been the case without an intervention. The patient made a full clinical recovery over the next 48 hours. We conclude that at least 1 session of intermittent hemodialysis may shorten the time to return to the nontoxic range in severe clinically patent intoxication. It should be considered early in its clinical course pending chemical confirmation, even in frail elderly patients. Careful dosage adjustment and a high index of suspicion are essential in this population.

Candidates who became more frail between 3-category states (HR=2.27, 95%CI:1.11-4.65) or frailty scores (HR=2.36, 95%CI:1.12-4.99) had increased risk of post-KT mortality and had higher odds of length of stay (LOS) &gt;/=2 weeks (3-category: OR=2.02, 95%CI:1.20-3.40; scores: OR=1.92, 95%CI:1.13-3.25).
N2  - BACKGROUND: Frail kidney transplant (KT) recipients have higher risk of adverse post-KT outcomes. Yet, there is interest in measuring frailty at KT evaluation and then using this information for post-KT risk stratification. Given long wait times for KT, frailty may improve or worsen between evaluation and KT. Patterns, predictors, and post-KT adverse outcomes associated with these changes are unclear. METHODS: 569 adult KT candidates were enrolled in a cohort study of frailty (11/2009-09/2017) at evaluation and followed-up at KT. Patterns of frailty transitions were categorized as: 1) binary state change (frail/nonfrail); 2) 3-category state change (frail/intermediate/nonfrail); and 3) raw score change (-5 to 5). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used to test whether patterns of frailty transitions were associated with adverse post-KT outcomes. RESULTS: Between evaluation and KT, 22.0% became more frail, while 24.4% became less frail. Black race (RRR=1.98, 95%CI:1.07-3.67) was associated with frail-to-nonfrail transition; diabetes (RRR=2.56, 95%CI:1.22-5.39) was associated with remaining stably frail. Candidates who became more frail between 3-category states (HR=2.27, 95%CI:1.11-4.65) or frailty scores (HR=2.36, 95%CI:1.12-4.99) had increased risk of post-KT mortality and had higher odds of length of stay (LOS) >/=2 weeks (3-category: OR=2.02, 95%CI:1.20-3.40; scores: OR=1.92, 95%CI:1.13-3.25). CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of KT candidates experienced change in frailty between evaluation and KT, and those transitions were associated with mortality and longer LOS. Monitoring changes in frailty from evaluation to admission may improve post-KT risk stratification.

There were 111 patients (62.4%) physically frail, amongst those 48 (43.2%) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without frailty.

.

For the groups with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin decreased in a stepwise manner (35.8 +/- 5.6, 34.9 +/- 4.4, and 32.9 +/- 5.3 g/L, respectively, p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 ± 0.61, 5.41 ± 0.59, and 5.04 ± 0.77, respectively (p&lt;0.0001), and MIS was 5.12 ± 2.30, 7.13 ± 3.22, and 9.48 ± 3.97, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). At 24 months, patient survival was 86.6%, 71.4%, and 62.5% for patients with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, respective (p=0.001). The median number of hospital stay was 8.04 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.91 – 19.42), 14.05 (IQR 3.57 – 37.27), and 26.62 (IQR 10.65 – 61.18) days per year of follow up, respectively (p&lt;0.0001).
N2  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frailty and depression both contribute to malnutrition and adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, their interaction is incompletely defined. METHODS: We studied 178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed by a validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by the Geriatric Depression Scale; nutritional status was determined by subjective global assessment (SGA) and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS). All patients were followed for up to 24 months for survival and hospitalization analysis. RESULTS: There were 111 patients (62.4%) physically frail, amongst those 48 (43.2%) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without frailty. There was an additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty on nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin decreased in a stepwise manner (35.8 +/- 5.6, 34.9 +/- 4.4, and 32.9 +/- 5.3 g/L, respectively, p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 +/- 0.61, 5.41 +/- 0.59, and 5.04 +/- 0.77, respectively (p< 0.0001), and MIS was 5.12 +/- 2.30, 7.13 +/- 3.22, and 9.48 +/- 3.97, respectively (p< 0.0001). At 24 months, patient survival was 86.6%, 71.4%, and 62.5% for patients with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, respective (p=0.001). The median number of hospital stay was 8.04 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.91 - 19.42), 14.05 (IQR 3.57 - 37.27), and 26.62 (IQR 10.65 - 61.18) days per year of follow up, respectively (p< 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Physical frailty and depressive symptoms are both common in Chinese PD patients, and they have additive adverse effect on the nutritional status and clinical outcome.

N2  - Objective: to assess the frail level of the elderly with chronic kidney disease under conservative treatment. Methods: this is a cross-sectional and correlational study performed with 35 elderly. The frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale instrument. A descriptive analysis and Spearman correlation coefficients were performed. Results: the frailty showed a minimal variation of 1 and maximum of 14, with a mean score 7.71 (±3.10). Women (8.05±3.551) and illiterates (9.57±2.637) showed a higher mean score of frail. By correlating the frail score, a moderate inverse correlation was found with years of study (p=0.033) and moderate positive correlation with some complications (p<0.05). Conclusion: the elderly with chronic kidney disease under conservative treatment showed some frailty degree, the highest levels were correlated with lower education and a higher number of clinical complications

N2  - Fixed-dose triple drug combinations represent one of the latest
innovations of pharmacotherapy for hypertension (HT). They combine a
traditional renin-angiotensin system blocker, a diuretic and a calcium
channel blocker. The main benefit is the simplification of treatment
regimen because 3 different agents are combined at different doses in a
single pill. Improving adherence to treatment partly explains why this
kind of combination may effectively reduce blood pressure (BP). BP
lowering by a single- pill triple-drug combination can be approximately
predicted, by using appropriate formulas described in previous
meta-analysis of randomized trials. Thus, clinicians may select the
appropriate dose for each of the combined drugs. Selection of different
types of fixed-dose triple-drug combinations relies upon clinical
experience, commercial availability and evidence from clinical trials
and meta-analyses for each agent alone. However, triple fixed-dose drug
combinations should be reserved only for patients with uncontrolled BP
with 2 agents, poor adherence in complex therapeutic regimens or on
inappropriate free-drug combinations. Also, triple therapy may help
overcome clinical inertia by prescribing more potent antihypertensive
formulations in one pill.
In contrast, this type of multiple-drug fixed-dose combination might be
less safe in very old and frail patients, as well as in those with
chronic kidney disease. Although new combinations may help overcome the
clinical inertia of achieving individualized BP targets, doctors should
also pay attention reinforcement of lifestyle changes.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcopenia and muscle weakness contribute to fragility and limit exercise tolerance among patients with CKD. This review focuses on the role of reduction in mitochondrial mass and function in the myopathy associated with CKD, causes for these muscle mitochondrial abnormalities, and potential therapeutic interventions that may improve mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as skeletal muscle function and performance in patients with CKD. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial structure, function, and composition have been shown in both experimental models and patients with CKD. A significant reduction in mitochondrial respiratory function and an increase in mitochondrial complex 1 enzyme activity has been demonstrated in the muscle tissue of male Sprague-Dawley rats following 5/6 nephrectomy. These changes were associated with a substantial reduction in skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass. In patients with CKD, in-vivo magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy show significantly elevated resting skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and lower mean mitochondrial coupling ratio indicating disrupted muscle mitochondrial metabolism and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with advanced CKD show lower mitochondrial volume density and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number than controls. SUMMARY: Advanced CKD is associated with decreased exercise capacity, skeletal muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. Impaired mitochondrial respiratory function, reduced muscle mitochondrial mass, and decreased energy production in skeletal muscle play a critical role in this 'acquired mitochondrial myopathy' of CKD. It is reasonable, therefore, to develop therapeutic interventions that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as skeletal muscle function and performance in patients with CKD.

N2  - Anemia is extremely common following hip fracture. Consistent data from randomized trials show that transfusion of less blood, with a transfusion threshold around 8 g/dL hemoglobin concentration, is preferable to a traditional threshold of 10 g/dL. Adoption of a lower threshold leads to at least equivalent clinical outcomes, with much less exposure to transfusion costs and risks. The most common complication of transfusion is circulatory overload. Future research may elucidate the optimal transfusion threshold for these elderly patients and address the specific needs of subgroups of patients, including those with acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease.

The magnitude of association of PbF with quadriceps muscle area was greater than 10 years of age (-30.3 cm2 P = .02 vs. -6.6 cm2 P = .0001) in multivariate analysis.
N2  - UNLABELLED: Although sarcopenia is thought to underlie the manifestations of frailty, association of frailty with measures of body composition is underinvestigated. METHODS: Eighty hemodialysis patients were included in the study. Performance-based frailty (PbF) used gait speed over 20 feet and 5 sit-to-stand (1 point each for lowest quintile) for the physical components of the frailty phenotype plus exhaustion (Short Form-36 [SF-36] vitality score <55) and physical activity (lowest quintile of weekly kcal energy expenditure on leisure activity on the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly questionnaire; 1 point). Function-based frailty (FbF) defined by questionnaire measures of physical functioning (SF-36 Physical Function score <75; 1 point), exhaustion, and physical activity as for PbF. A score of 2 or greater was defined as frail. Outcomes related to muscle size included muscle area of the contractile tissue of the anterior tibialis and quadriceps muscles using magnetic resonance imaging, phase angle using bioimpedance analysis, lean body mass using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and body mass index (BMI). Linear regression was used to analyze associations between frailty and muscle size, with and without sex and age covariates. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of individuals met PbF criteria, 63% met FbF criteria, and 55% met both. In univariate analysis, PbF and FbF were associated with smaller muscle area of the quadriceps, smaller phase angle, and higher BMI. Associations remained significant for the quadriceps after adjustment for age and sex. The magnitude of association of PbF with quadriceps muscle area was greater than 10 years of age (-30.3 cm(2)P = .02 vs. -6.6 cm(2)P < .0001) in multivariate analysis. There was no significant association between either measure of frailty and other measures of body composition after adjustment for age and sex. CONCLUSION: Frailty was associated with measurements related to muscle size in a population of individuals with chronic kidney disease, a known contributor to muscle wasting.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between physical performance and a decline in activities of daily living (ADL) in elderly people who were certifi ed by Japanese long- term care insurance. Methods: The subjects were 2,695 elderly people who used day-care services (mean age: 81.9 ± 6.7 years; men: 916; women: 1,779). The 13 motor subscales of the Functional Independence Measure were used to assess ADL. The subjects were divided into two groups: the ADL independent group, who scored ≥ 6 points in all ADL measures, and the ADL care need group, who scored ≤ 5 points for at least one item in all ADL measures. Physical performance tests included grip strength, the chair stand test 5 times, one leg standing with the eyes open, walking speed, and the timed “up & go” test. The multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the relationships between ADL status and physical performances which were showed signifi cant diff erences in univariate analysis. Results: The multiple logistic regression model showed that all physical performances were signifi cantly associated with a decline in ADL. By the analysis for the level of care, the moderately disabled group, performance in grip strength, the chair stand test 5 times, walking speed and the timed “up & go” test were signifi cantly associated with a decline in ADL. In the severely disabled group, walking speed was signifi cantly associated with a decline in ADL. Walking speed showed a particularly strong correlation with a decline in ADL (moderately disabled: OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.57‒4.16; p<0.01; severely disabled: OR, 2.36, 95% CI, 1.12‒5.50; p<0.05). Conclusions: Our results suggest that targeted intervention to improve walking speed may be useful for preventing a decline in ADL in elderly people.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - Background: The influence of comorbid conditions on ventricular
remodeling, functional status, and clinical outcome after cardiac
resynchronization therapy (CRT) is insufficiently elucidated.
Methods and Results: The influence of different comorbid conditions on
left ventricular remodeling, improvement in New York Heart Association
(NYHA) functional class, hospitalizations for heart failure, and
all-cause mortality after CRT implantation was analyzed in 172
consecutive patients (mean age 71 +/- 9 y), implanted from October 2008
to April 2011 in a single tertiary care hospital. During mean follow-up
of 18 +/- 9 months, 21 patients died and 57 were admitted for heart
failure. Left ventricular remodeling and improvement in NYHA functional
class were independent from comorbidity burden. However, diabetes
mellitus (hazard ratio {[}HR] 3.45, 95% confidence interval {[}CI]
1.24-9.65) and chronic kidney disease (HR 3.11, 95% CI 1.10-8.81) were
predictors of all-cause mortality, and the presence of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.89, 95% Cl 1.02-3.53) was
independently associated with heart failure admissions. Importantly,
those 3 comorbid conditions had an additive negative impact on survival
and heart failure admissions, even in patients with reverse left
ventricular remodeling.
Conclusions: Reverse ventricular remodeling and improvement in
functional status after CRT implantation are independent from
comorbidity burden. However, comorbid conditions remain important
predictors of all-cause mortality and heart failure admissions. (1

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the association between frailty and chronic kidney disease. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection remain elusive.

N2  - Background: Frail and polypathological patients (PP) are often undertreated with evidence-based cardiovascular drugs, as their benefits are uncertain in this population.; Objectives: To determine the effects of treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers/inhibitors (ACEI/ARB), statins and/or beta-blockers on survival rates and functional decline in PP with evidence-based clinical indications for treatment with any of these drug families.; Method: Prospective observational multicentre cohort study with a 12-month follow-up period. We selected PP with any condition of the following: chronic heart failure, coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus with any visceral involvement, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. Clinical, functional (Barthel index), socio-familial risk data and drug prescriptions were measured at baseline. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models were used to identify variables independently associated with survival and functional decline.; Results: The analysis included 1260 PP. The mean age was 79±9.5 years. The mortality rate was 34.5%. Statin (aHR 0.671; P=0.001), beta-blocker plus statin (aHR 0.645; P=0.007), ACEI/ARB plus statin (aHR 0.680; P=0.002), or combined ACEI/ARB plus statin plus beta-blocker (aHR 0.541; P=0.000) prescriptions were associated with longer survival times. Additionally, PP whose Barthel index was ≥60 showed a lower risk of disability progression if treated with statins (aOR=0.476; P=0.000), or their combinations, mainly with ACEI/ARB plus beta-blockers (aOR 0.563; P=0.031).; Conclusions: The prescription of statins, alone or in combination with other drugs, may impact the survival and functional decline in polypathological patients. Further prospective blinded randomised assays are needed to confirm these observations.; Copyright © 2011 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Skeletal muscle mass and muscle function are negatively affected by a variety of conditions inherent to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to dialysis treatment. Skeletal muscle mass and function serve as indicators of the nutritional and clinical state of CKD patients, and low values or derangements over time are strong predictors of poor patient outcomes. However, muscle size and function can be affected by different factors, may decline at different rates, and may have different patient implications. Therefore, operational definitions of frailty and sarcopenia have emerged to encompass these 2 dimensions of muscle health, i.e., size and functionality. The aim of this review is to appraise available methods for assessment of muscle mass and functionality, with an emphasis on their accuracy in the setting of CKD patients. We then discuss the selection of reference cutoffs for defining conditions of muscle wasting and dysfunction. Finally, we review definitions applied in studies addressing sarcopenia and frailty in CKD patients and discuss their applicability for diagnosis and monitoring.

N2  - The prevalence of diabetes is increasing especially in older age due to
increased life expectancy. In old age, diabetes is associated with high
comorbidity burden and increased prevalence of geriatric syndromes
including frailty in addition to microand macro-vascular complications.
The emergence of frailty may change the natural history of Type 2
diabetes from a progressive to a regressive course with increased risk
of hypoglycemia. This may result in normalization of blood glucose
levels and lead to a state of burnt-out diabetes in frail older people
with significant weight loss. Although guidelines suggest relaxed
glycemic control in frail elderly with diabetes, complete withdrawal of
hypoglycemic medications may be necessary in these frail populations to
reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.
Lay abstract: Diabetes is a common disease especially in older people.
Aging is associated with reduced appetite and reduced food intake due to
lack of exercise and diminished energy consumption. In certain
individuals this may be significant leading to weight loss, malnutrition
and the development of frailty. As a result the doses of diabetes
medications may be too strong for this frail population especially if
they have organ dysfunction reducing medication clearance and increasing
the risk of low blood glucose level events. Therefore, reduction or
complete withdrawal of diabetes medications may be considered in this
frail group.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To update the evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and management of hypertension in adults for 2009. OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES: For lifestyle and pharmacological interventions, evidence from randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews of trials was preferentially reviewed. Changes in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes of interest. However, for lifestyle interventions, blood pressure lowering was accepted as a primary outcome given the lack of long-term morbidity and mortality data in this field. Progression of kidney dysfunction was also accepted as a clinically relevant primary outcome among patients with chronic kidney disease. EVIDENCE: A Cochrane collaboration librarian conducted an independent MEDLINE search from 2007 to August 2008 to update the 2008 recommendations. To identify additional published studies, reference lists were reviewed and experts were contacted. All relevant articles were reviewed and appraised independently by both content and methodological experts using prespecified levels of evidence. RECOMMENDATIONS: For lifestyle modifications to prevent and treat hypertension, restrict dietary sodium to less than 2300 mg (100 mmol)/day (and 1500 mg to 2300 mg [65 mmol to 100 mmol]/day in hypertensive patients); perform 30 min to 60 min of aerobic exercise four to seven days per week; maintain a healthy body weight (body mass index 18.5 kg/m(2) to 24.9 kg/m(2)) and waist circumference (smaller than 102 cm for men and smaller than 88 cm for women); limit alcohol consumption to no more than 14 units per week in men or nine units per week in women; follow a diet that is reduced in saturated fat and cholesterol, and that emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fibre, whole grains and protein from plant sources; and consider stress management in selected individuals with hypertension. For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on by the patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to lower than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to lower than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered in all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in elderly patients who are frail). For adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic and/or systolic hypertension include angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in patients who are not black), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered as the initial treatment of hypertension if the systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above the target or if the diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above the target. The combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include long- acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement (recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease). Selected high-risk patients with hypertension who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy according to the position paper should nonetheless receive statin therapy. Once blood pressure is controlled, acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered. VALIDATION: All recommendations were graded according to strength of the evidence and voted on by the 57 members of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force. All recommendations reported here achieved at least 95% consensus. These guidelines will continue to be updated annually.

did not measure effects of frailty in patients with CKD
N2  - Contemporary Japan is known both for its high tech culture and its rapidly aging population, with 22 % of people currently 65 years and older. Yet there has been little attention to the material culture of the elderly. This paper explores the way aging bodies, official ideology, and consumption of what are called "assistive devices" and "life technologies" come together in the experience of frail old people who depend not only on human caregivers but on "things" such as walkers, kidney dialysis machines, and electric massage chairs. It begins to consider the questions: What technology to aid failing bodies is available, and to whom? How does the advocacy of independence create new forms of consumption? How do "things" mediate ideological change regarding elder care and help to create new understandings of self and one's relation to others? Data come from interviews conducted in 2003-2007 as part of a study of elder care in Japan under the public long term care insurance system that began in 2000. These interviews point both to acceptance of the technology as a way to avoid over-dependence on caregivers, and to resistance to the limitations of aging and to its 21st century definition by the state.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe basic demographics and clinical outcomes among elderly end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients physically dependent on a caregiver and maintained on an assisted automated peritoneal dialysis (AAPD) program. DESIGN: Retrospective single-center study based on patient records and data files. SETTING: University Hospital. PATIENTS: 64 physically dependent AAPD patients followed for 1.012 treatment months. Assistance and care was delivered by 52 briefly trained teams of visiting nurses or nursing home staff. RESULT: Crude 1-year survival was 58% and 2-year survival was 48%. Crude 1- and 2-year survivals, excluding deaths within 90 days, were 66% and 54% respectively. We found no significant effect on survival by main causes of ESRD, gender, age, late referral, need for acute start, social isolation, physical dependency on help at inclusion, or residence in a nursing home. 10% of patient-days on AAPD were spent in hospital. 13 (20%) of the patients were converted permanently to hemodialysis due to PD technique failure. The incidence of peritonitis was 1 in every 25.3 treatment-months. CONCLUSIONS: AAPD may be a feasible and safe option for renal replacement therapy for frail, elderly, and physically dependent patients with ESRD. Despite the special patient selection for this AAPD program, we achieved results of international standards for patient survival, PD technique survival, and incidence of acute peritonitis. These results do notjustify withholding dialysis from this group of patients.

N2  - Vitamin D deficiency state is endemic in the Kashmir valley of the Indian subcontinent. Clinicians frequently treat patients with Vitamin D for diverse clinical symptoms to improve the general health and to reduce the frailty of elderly and these doses may at times be inappropriately high. Vitamin D toxicity-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), often considered rare, can be life-threatening and associated with substantial morbidity if not identified promptly. We aimed to describe clinical and biochemical features, risk factors, and management of AKI patients with Vitamin D toxicity seen at a single tertiary care centre in Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India, between January 2014 and January 2016. Evaluation included detailed clinical history and biochemical tests including serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Nineteen patients with Vitamin D toxicity-induced AKI could be identified. Clinical manifestations included nausea, vomiting, altered sensorium, constipation, pancreatitis, AKI, acute on chronic kidney disease, and weight loss. Median (range) age was 64 (45-89) years. Median (range) serum 25(OH)D level and median (range) total serum calcium level were 99 (190-988) ng/mL and 139 (119-152) mg/dL, respectively. Overdose of Vitamin D caused by prescription of megadoses of Vitamin D was the cause of AKI in all cases. Median (range) cumulative Vitamin D dose was 6,000,000 (3,600,000-9,000,000) IU. On three- and six-month follow-up, the creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate normalized and returned to baseline in all patients except three cases who had underlying chronic kidney disease. Three patients needed rehospitalization for another episode of AKI. Our data demonstrate an emergence of Vitamin D toxicity as a cause of AKI in this part of the world. Irrational use of Vitamin D in megadoses resulted in AKI in all cases. Persistence of Vitamin D in the body for longer time resulted in rehospitalization of patients with AKI. Awareness among health-care providers regarding the toxic potential of high doses of Vitamin D and cautious use of Vitamin D supplements can have immense value to prevent this AKI.

N2  - Patients with ESRD have extensive and unique end-of-life care considerations and  needs. Despite substantial advancements in renal palliative care over the past decade, much research is still required. Identifying CKD patients whose illness trajectory has shifted and would likely benefit from a palliative approach to care should be a priority of all nephrology programs. Further research on symptom management, the effectiveness of ACP, the life expectancy of conservatively managed and incident dialysis patients, anticipated changes in functional status and HRQL with the initiation of dialysis (especially among the frail elderly), and the best way to deliver renal palliative care is required to maximize the integration and effectiveness of renal palliative care services.

N2  - AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI). METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD. RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD 0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of frail older patients with advanced heart failure have scarcely been studied. OBJECTIVE: To describe this population and to identify some prognostic factors of mortality. METHODS: 104 patients aged 75 years and older hospitalized with refractory heart failure were enrolled in a prospective multicentric study. RESULTS: Mean age was 87.2 +/- 5.3 years. Dyspnea (79.8%), crepitant rales (76.9%) and peripheral edema (73.1%) were particularly frequent. Signs of low cardiac output such as renal insufficiency (46.9%), cutaneous low flow (40.4%), and systolic hypotension (< or =100 mm Hg) (24.3%) were observed less often. Signs of cognitive impairment including anxiety (55.4%), sleep disorders (43.7%) and delirium (35.5%) were frequent. Asthenia and chronic pain were noted in 92.3 and 37.5% of cases, respectively. Mortality rates were 32.7, 59.6 and 71.2% during hospitalization, at 6 months and at 12 months, respectively. According to the multivariate Cox model, six significant factors suggesting a poor prognosis were observed: chronic renal insufficiency, past neuropsychological pathology, long-term treatment with nitrates, presence of edema, low cutaneous flow, and pain. The ability to sit on a chair was the only significant factor associated with a good prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our study identified some clinical and prognostic factors which had been observed in very old patients with refractory heart failure. Pain management has to be a priority in these patients in order to improve their quality of life.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Older adults are disproportionately affected by disaster. Frail elders, individuals with chronic diseases, conditions, or disabilities, and those who live in long-term care facilities are especially vulnerable. Purpose The purpose of this integrative review of the literature was to describe the system-wide knowledge and skills that multi-disciplinary health care providers need to provide appropriate care for the elderly during domestic-humanitarian and disaster-relief efforts. Data sources A systematic search protocol was developed in conjunction with a research librarian. Searches of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were conducted using terms such as Disaster, Geological Processes, Aged, Disaster Planning, and Vulnerable Populations. Forty-six articles met criteria for inclusion in the review. CONCLUSIONS: Policies and guidance regarding evacuating versus sheltering in place are lacking. Tenets of elderly-focused disaster planning/preparation and clarification of legal and ethical standards of care and liability issues are needed. Functional capacity, capabilities, or impairments, rather than age, should be considered in disaster preparation. Older adults should be included in disaster planning as population-specific experts. Implications for Practice A multifaceted approach to population-specific disaster planning and curriculum development should include consideration of the biophysical and psychosocial aspects of care, ethical and legal issues, logistics, and resources.

N2  - Renal functional reserve (RFR) represents the capacity of the kidney to increase  glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to certain physiological or pathological stimuli or conditions. Once baseline GFR is determined, RFR can be assessed clinically after an oral protein load or intravenous amino acid infusion. In clinical practice, baseline GFR displays variable levels due to diet or other factors. RFR is the difference between peak 'stress' GFR induced by the test (p.o. or i.v.) and the baseline GFR. In clinical scenarios where hyperfiltration is present (high baseline GFR due to pregnancy, hypertension or diabetic nephropathy, in solitary kidney or kidney donors), RFR may be fully or partially used to achieve normal or supranormal renal function. Since commonly used renal function markers, such as GFR, may remain within normal ranges until 50% of nephrons are lost or in patients with a single remnant kidney, the RFR test may represent a sensitive and early way to assess the functional decline in the kidney. RFR assessment may become an important tool to evaluate the ability of the kidney to recover completely or partially after a kidney attack. In case of healing with a defect and progressive fibrosis, recovery may appear complete clinically, but a reduced RFR may be a sign of a maladaptive repair or subclinical loss of renal mass. Thus, a reduction in RFR may represent the equivalent of renal frailty or susceptibility to insults. The main aim of this article is to review the concept of RFR, its utility in different clinical scenarios, and future perspective for its use.

N2  - In dialysis patients, physical function is associated with mortality.
However, the association between physical function at the time of
dialysis initiation and subsequent mortality remains unknown.
A total of 1496 patients with chronic kidney disease who initiated
dialysis at 17 centers participating in the Aichi Cohort Study of the
Prognosis in Patients Newly Initiated into Dialysis, a multicenter
prospective cohort study, were included. The patients were divided into
the high (H)-, middle (M)-, and low (L)-score groups according to
Barthel index (BI) at the time of dialysis initiation, and the
all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related, and infection-related
mortality rates were compared. Moreover, factors affecting all-cause
mortality were investigated. The effects of BI on mortality were
assessed in the patients stratified by age, sex, and history of CVD or
cerebral infarction.
A log-rank test for the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed significant
differences between the three groups in all-cause, CVD-related, and
infection-related mortality rates (p < 0.001). Cox proportional hazard
regression analysis with the step-wise method showed a significantly
higher risk of all-cause mortality in the M and L groups than in the H
group (M group: HR 1.612, 95 % CI 1.075-2.417; L group: HR 1.994, 95 %
CI 1.468-2.709). Regardless of the age categories and the history of
CVD, the risk of all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the L
group than in the H group.
Physical function assessed by BI at the time of dialysis initiation was
found to be associated with subsequent mortality.

N2  - AIM: To evaluate the relationship between kidney function without diabetes and components of the frailty phenotype in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. METHODS: Participants were 8343 residents who completed baseline assessments, classified into four categories according to eGFR. Frailty status was defined using five criteria: (i) slow gait speed; (ii) muscle weakness; (iii) low physical activity; (iv) exhaustion; and (v) unintentional weight loss. RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with the lowest kidney function were at higher risk of frailty (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02-3.50) than those with normal kidney function. In addition, after adjustment for multiple confounders, estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 was associated with a greater risk of the individual frailty components of weight loss (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.11-4.12), low physical activity (OR 1.35, 95% CI, 1.01-2.54) and slowness (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.36-3.77) compared with estimated glomerular filtration rate >/=60. CONCLUSIONS: Lower kidney function was associated with a higher risk of weight loss, low physical activity and slowness among community-dwelling Japanese older adults.

N2  - Observational studies have consistently documented independent, strong
associations of anemia-even if not severe-with major adverse functional
outcomes in older adults. In this chapter, recent epidemiologic evidence
linking mild anemia with decline in physical and cognitive function,
frailty, and disability in community-dwelling older adults is reviewed.
Altogether, these biologically plausible associations provide empirical,
though not conclusive, support for the notion of mild anemia as a cause
of adverse functional outcomes in older adults. Randomized clinical
trial data assessing the impact of anemia correction on functional
outcomes are lacking at this time.

N2  - Objectives: The combined effects of reduced functional mobility, muscle
weakness, and low serum albumin on mortality in hemodialysis patients
have not been clarified. Here, we examined the associations of reduced
functional mobility, muscle weakness, and low serum albumin-both alone
and in combination-with all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients.
Methods: A total of 490 patients treated between July 2010 and October
2016 were enrolled retrospectively in this study. The independent
prognostic effect of the combination of reduced functional mobility,
muscle weakness, and low serum albumin on survival was estimated by Cox
proportional hazard regression analysis. We calculated the increases in
predictive capacity by combining the associations of reduced functional
mobility, muscle weakness, and low serum albumin in comparison to each
component alone based on the receiver-operating characteristic curves,
continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated
discrimination improvement (IDI).
Results: The final study population consisted of 314 hemodialysis
patients, and 56 patients died during the 6.5-year follow-up period. The
high Combined score group showed a significantly lower cumulative
survival rate than the low Combined score group (hazard ratio, 3.30;
95% confidence interval, 1.59-6.87; P = .001). Both NRI and IDI
suggested that the addition of Combined score to patient characteristics
improved discrimination of patients at high risk of mortality (NRI,
0.038 95% CI: 0.096 - 0.064, P < .001 IDI, 0.029 95% CI: 0.004 -
0.055, P = .025).
Conclusions: The combined assessment of reduced functional mobility,
muscle weakness, and low serum albumin was associated with poorer
prognosis in patients on hemodialysis. The results presented here
indicated that the combination of reduced functional mobility, muscle
weakness, and low serum albumin is useful for accurate prediction of
prognosis in hemodialysis patients. (C) 2018 by the National Kidney

N2  - We report the case of an 85-year-old man with a recurrent thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm who underwent two-staged combined endovascular and surgical procedure. First, two retrograde bypasses using saphenous vein grafts were implanted from the right common iliac artery to the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery. Two weeks later the aneurysm was successfully excluded with a stent-graft. The postoperative course was uneventful. This two-staged combined endovascular and surgical approach may be a safe and effective alternative to open surgical repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm in high-risk patients.

N2  - Purpose of reviewMany frailty screening instruments have been proposed
due to the lack of consensus on a unified operational definition of
frailty. This review reports on recent frailty screening tools in
addition to revisiting the frailty concept.Recent findingsAlthough there
are two representative frailty models, both have issues that prevent
them from being implemented in clinical settings despite their
remarkable advantages. Due to their different characteristics, these
models are thought to be complementary rather than substitutive. The
recent introduction of frailty identification into primary care and
specific clinical settings has led to both a focus on its importance and
the development of new screening methods.SummaryThe phenotype model is
rather faithfully based on biological change with aging, while the
deficit model comprehensively captures risk of disability. Most of the
current frailty screening tools are based on these models. Screening
tools based on the former model primarily capture declines in physical
functions, whereas screening tools based on the latter model involve
questionnaires that examine functional impairments in multiple domains.
Implementation of a model in a clinical setting depends on both the
model characteristics and the clinical settings.

N2  - The numbers of older patients requiring dialysis therapy is rising, reflecting the ageing of the general population. Older dialysis patients have a tendency to present later for dialysis, have a higher number of comorbid conditions, are at higher risk of cognitive dysfunction and have increased levels of frailty. These are all barriers to home dialysis therapy so hospital haemodialysis (HD) is the predominant dialysis modality for older patients. Evidence suggests, however, that home treatment with peritoneal dialysis (PD) intrudes less into the life of older patients than hospital HD. Assisted PD is available in some countries and this enables more older patients to be treated in their own homes. Adjustments to patient education also need to be made to accommodate the barriers to learning and decision-making that often exist in older people.

N2  - Emphysematous pyelonephritis most often presents as an acute medical emergency, typically in a septic diabetic patient with acute renal failure. The management of this condition has traditionally been surgical, with nephrectomy. However, some recent reports have described successful medical interventions. We describe a case of acute bilateral emphysematous pyelonephritis in a frail patient not suitable for bilateral nephrectomy and long-term dialysis. This condition was managed medically, not surgically, with intensive antibiotic and circulatory support. The outcome was complete recovery after months of hospital-based treatment. We discuss the management of this rare but important condition in detail.

N2  - Quality of life is particularly important for older patients with end-stage kidney disease, particularly when likely survival is short because of the burden of comorbidities. The features of old age and frailty make it difficult to cope with both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Evidence exists that quality of life is better on peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis, yet the majority of older patients are placed on hemodialysis. Older patients should therefore receive appropriate education to enable choice of the appropriate dialysis modality for their lifestyle. The development of assisted peritoneal dialysis will enable those who cannot perform their own dialysis to have their treatment at home. Delaying dialysis to a time when it is actually needed and discussing the option of conservative care will also improve the quality of the end-of-life phase for patients with multiple comorbidities and with a poor overall prognosis.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The chronic use of renal replacement therapy in frail elderly patients sometimes  provides no tangible benefits and may even have a negative fallout on their quality of life, making prolonged conservative management a reasonable option. However, this is mostly a feeling, since very few papers have addressed this issue and there is no evidence-based medicine related to it. On the other hand, ethical issues are extraordinarily relevant and in this clinical setting extend beyond topics such as end-of-life care and advance care planning. It is evident that clinical decision-making in frail elderly patients with endstage renal disease may be very difficult and needs to be supported by ad hoc clinical trials. In the meantime, the ethical issues must be discussed in society.

However, Frailty Score was not an independent predictor of patient or technique survival.
N2  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies showed that frailty is prevalent in both pre-dialysis and dialysis patients. However, the prevalence and prognostic implication of frailty in Chinese peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients remain unknown. METHODS: We used a validated questionnaire to determine the Frailty Score of 193 unselected prevalent PD patients. All patients were then followed for 2 years for their need of hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS: Amongst the 193 patients, 134 (69.4%) met the criteria of being frail. Frailty Score significantly correlated with Charlson's comorbidity score (r = 0.40, p < 0.0001), Malnutrition Inflammation Score (r = 0.59, p < 0.0001), and inversely with Subjective Global Assessment score (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001). Frailty was closely associated with the need of hospitalization. Patients with nil, mild, moderate, and severe frailty required 2.4 +/- 6.0, 1.6 +/- 1.6, 2.7 +/- 2.5, 5.2 +/- 4.8 hospital admissions per year, respectively (p < 0.0001), and they stayed in hospital for 6.4 +/- 9.2, 5.3 +/- 6.2, 10.0 +/- 10.4, 12.9 +/- 20.1 days per hospital admission, respectively (p < 0.0001). However, Frailty Score was not an independent predictor of patient or technique survival. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is prevalent among Chinese PD patients. Frail PD patients have a high risk of requiring hospitalization and their hospital stay tends to be prolonged. Early identification may allow timely intervention to prevent adverse health outcomes in this group of patients.

only frailty was associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up (OR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.32-5.90) and worsening HRQOL at follow-up (RR: 2.91, 95%CI: 1.08-7.80).
N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with worse health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older adults and worse clinical outcomes in adults of all ages with end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is unclear whether frail adults of all ages with ESRD are more likely to experience worse HRQOL. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to identify factors associated with worsening HRQOL in this population. DESIGN, SETTING AND MEASUREMENTS: We studied 233 adults of all ages with ESRD enrolled (11/2009-11/2013) in a longitudinal cohort study. Frailty status was measured at enrollment and HRQOL was reported (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor) at the initial assessment and follow-up (median follow-up 9.4 months). We studied factors associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up using logistic regression and factors associated with HRQOL change using multinomial regression. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, BMI, diabetes status, history of a previous transplant, type of dialysis and time between assessments. RESULTS: Fair/Poor HRQOL was reported by 28% at initial assessment and 33% at follow-up. 47.2% of participants had stable HRQOL, 22.8% better HRQOL, and 30.0% worse HRQOL at follow-up (P<0.001). In adjusted models, only frailty was associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up (OR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.32-5.90) and worsening HRQOL at follow-up (RR: 2.91, 95%CI: 1.08-7.80). CONCLUSIONS: Frail adults of all ages with ESRD are more likely to experience fair/poor HRQOL and worsening HRQOL over time. Frailty represents a state of decreased physiologic reserve that impacts not only clinical outcomes but also the patient-centered outcome of HRQOL.

N2  - In patients with lymphoma, an important issue that has been recognized
is renal involvement, including glomerulonephritis, acute kidney injury,
and lymphoma infiltrating the kidney. However, the prevalence and
mortality of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not been fully understood
in lymphoma patients. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of CKD
and its impact on mortality in those patients.
This was a retrospective cohort study of 429 consecutive lymphoma
patients who were admitted or regularly visited our hospital from
January 2013 to October 2016. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) < 60mL/min/1.73m(2) and/or proteinuria >= 1+ that
was sustained for at least 3 months. The prevalence of CKD at enrollment
was evaluated according to the modified CKD classification by Kidney
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) (eGFR and proteinuria
category). Dipstick proteinuria was classified into 3 grades: A1 for -
and +/-; A2 for 1+ or 2+; and A3 for >= 3+. The eGFR (mL/min/1.73m(2))
was classified into 6 stages: G1 for >= 90, G2 for 60 to 89, G3a for 45
to 59, G3b for 30 to 44, G4 for 15 to 29, and G5 for <15. The cumulative
mortality rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with
stratification into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of CKD.
Furthermore, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model
was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence
interval (CI) for all-cause mortality, after adjustments for age, sex,
pathologic type, clinical stage of lymphoma, presence or absence of
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.
The mean follow-up period was 3.06 +/- 0.96 years, and the prevalence of
CKD at study enrollment was 34.5%. The cumulative mortality rate was
20.7%, and was significantly higher in the CKD group than in the group
without CKD (36.4% vs 18.0%, P = .02). Multivariate analysis found
mortality to be significantly associated with CKD (HR 1.58; 95% CI,
1.01-2.46), and this association was the most robust with very high-risk
CKD (HR 6.94; 95% CI, 2.50-17.33).
The prevalence of CKD in lymphoma patients was high. CKD should be
considered an independent risk factor for mortality among patients with
lymphoma.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - New advances in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) change the perspective from which many of its features and treatment are viewed. Calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D have been shown to be important determinants of survival associated with kidney diseases. Now ROD dependent and independent of these factors is linked to survival more than just skeletal frailty. This review focuses on recent discoveries that renal injury impairs skeletal anabolism decreasing the osteoblast compartment of the skeleton and consequent bone formation. This discovery and the discovery that PTH regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche alters our view of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) from that of a disease to that of a necessary adaptation to renal injury that goes awry. Furthermore, ROD is shown to be an underappreciated factor in the level of the serum phosphorus in CKD. The discovery and the elucidation of the mechanism of hyperphosphatemia as a cardiovascular risk in CKD change the view of ROD. It is now recognized as more than a skeletal disorder, it is an important component of the mortality of CKD that can be treated.

N2  - The World Federation of Occupational Therapists defines Occupational Therapy as "...the treatment of physical and psychiatric conditions through specific activities in order to help people reach their maximum level of function and independence in all aspects of daily life." Occupational Therapy has long been associated with the frail and elderly, both in hospital and the community. In the United Kingdom however, it appears formal input to the renal multidisciplinary team is a relatively new development. Certainly across Europe, none of us needs reminding of the increasing incidence of older patients with renal failure. United Kingdom figures released in the Second Annual Report of the UK Renal Registry in December 1999 state that, "At the start of treatment 46% of patients were aged 65 or more" (1).

N2  - ObjectivesTo determine the association between frequency of leaving the
house and mortality.
DesignProspective follow-up of an age-homogenous, representative,
community-dwelling birth cohort (born 1920-21) from the Jerusalem
Longitudinal Study (1990-2015).
SettingHome.
ParticipantsIndividuals aged 70 (n=593), 78 (n=973), 85 (n=1164), and 90
(n=645), examined in 1990, 1998, 2005, and 2010, respectively.
MeasurementsFrequency of leaving the house, defined as daily (6-7/week),
often (2-5/week), and rarely (1/week); geriatric assessment; all-cause
mortality (2010-15). Kaplan-Meier survival charts and proportional
hazards models adjusted for social (sex, marital status, financial
status, loneliness), functional (sex, self-rated health, fatigue,
depression, physical activity, activity of daily living difficulty), and
medical (sex, chronic pain, visual impairment, hearing impairment,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney
disease) covariates.
ResultsAt ages 70, 78, 85, and 90, frequency of going out daily was
87.0%, 80.6%, 65.6%, and 48.4%; often was 6.4%, 9.5%, 17.4%, and
11.3%; and rarely was 6.6%, 10.0%, 17.0%, and 40.3% respectively.
Decreasing frequency of going out was associated with negative social,
functional, and medical characteristics. Survival rates were lowest
among those leaving rarely and highest among those going out daily
throughout follow-up. Similarly, compared with rarely leaving the house,
unadjusted mortality hazard ratios (HRs) were lowest among subjects
leaving daily and remained significant after adjustment for social,
functional and medical covariates. Among subjects leaving often,
unadjusted HRs showed a similar effect of smaller magnitude, with
attenuation of significance after adjustment in certain models. Findings
were unchanged after excluding subjects dying within 6months of
follow-up.
ConclusionIn community-dwelling elderly adults aged 70 to 90, leaving
the house daily was associated with lower mortality risk, independent of
social, functional, or medical status.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - A significant interaction between kidneys and lungs has been shown in physiological and pathological conditions. The two organs can both be targets of the same systemic disease (eg., some vasculitides). Moreover, loss of normal function of either of them can induce direct and indirect dysregulation of the other one. Subjects suffering from COPD may have systemic inflammation, hypoxemia, endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic activation and increased aortic stiffness. As well as the exposure to nicotine, all the foresaid factors can induce a microvascular damage, albuminuria, and a worsening of renal function. Renal failure in COPD can be unrecognized since elderly and frail patients may have normal serum creatinine concentration. Lungs and kidneys participate in maintaining the acid-base balance. Compensatory role of the lungs rapidly expresses through an increase or reduction of ventilation. Renal compensation usually requires a few days as it is achieved through changes in bicarbonate reabsorption. Chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal diseases increase the risk of pneumonia. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumonia and seasonal influenza is recommended for these patients. Vaccines against the last very virulent H1N1 influenza A strain are also available and effective. Acute lung injury and acute kidney injury are frequent complications in critical illnesses, associated with high morbidity and mortality. The concomitant failure of kidneys and lungs implies a multidisciplinary approach, both in terms of diagnostic processes and therapeutic management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Geriatric conditions may influence outcomes among patients receiving  implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). We sought to determine the prevalence of frailty and dementia among older adults receiving primary prevention ICDs and to determine the impact of multimorbidity on mortality within 1 year of ICD implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The cohort included 83 792 Medicare patients from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry who underwent first primary prevention ICD implantation between 2006 and 2009. These data were merged with Medicare analytic files to determine the prevalence of frailty, dementia, and other conditions before ICD implantation, as well as 1-year mortality. A validated claim-based algorithm was used to identify frail patients. Mutually exclusive patterns of chronic conditions were examined. The association of each pattern with 1-year mortality was assessed using logistic regression models adjusted for selected patient characteristics. Approximately 1 in 10 Medicare patients with heart failure receiving a primary prevention ICD had frailty (10%) or dementia (1%). One-year mortality was 22% for patients with frailty, 27% for patients with dementia, and 12% in the overall cohort. Several multimorbidity patterns were associated with high 1-year mortality rates: dementia with frailty (29%), frailty with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%), and frailty with diabetes mellitus (23%). These patterns were present in 8% of the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: More than 10% of Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure receiving primary prevention ICDs have frailty or dementia. These patients had significantly higher 1-year mortality than those with other common chronic conditions. Frailty and dementia should be considered in clinical decision-making and guideline development.

N2  - The present article provides an update on anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation in distinct clinical scenarios requiring particular considerations, such as ischaemic heart disease, electrical cardioversion, pulmonary vein ablation, the presence of valvular disease with or without prosthetic valves, and renal insufficiency, as well as old age and frailty. In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, the presence of renal insufficiency increases both thrombotic and haemorrhagic risk. In mild and moderate stages, direct-acting anticoagulants confer a greater benefit than warfarin, although they usually require dose adjustment. In renal failure/dialysis, there is no solid evidence that warfarin is beneficial and the use of direct-acting anticoagulants is not recommended. Because of its pathophysiology, oral anticoagulation could have a beneficial effect in patients with heart disease. However, vitamin K antagonists have not shown a satisfactory risk-benefit ratio. In contrast, direct-acting anticoagulants, at reduced doses, could have a beneficial effect in this scenario in association with antiplatelet agents. The use of direct-acting anticoagulants prior to electrical cardioversion in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation seems to be associated with a risk of cardioembolic events that is at least comparable to that of vitamin K antagonists. Their use avoids delay in the application of electrical cardioversion in patients without adequate INR levels. In the context of their use before and after atrial fibrillation ablation, dabiga-tran and rivaroxaban have demonstrated at least non-inferiority with vitamin K antagonists in terms of safety. In patients with any type or grade of valvular disease and atrial fibrillation, the indication of antithrombo-tic treatment must be evaluated in the same way as in patients with atrial fibrillation and no valvular di-sease. Whenever anticoagulation is required, direct-acting anticoagulants are the treatment of choice in nearly all situations, except in patients with mechanical valves or who have significant rheumatic mitral disease, who should be treated with vitamin K antagonists. The choice of appropriate antithrombotic stra-tegy in frail elderly patients is complex and involves multiple factors beyond assessment of embolic and haemorrhagic risk. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is essential for an individualised final decision. Moreover, any such decision should be consensus-based and periodically reviewed. Direct-acting anticoa-gulants could be the most beneficial alternative in most elderly patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.; Copyright © 2018 Elsevier España, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is directly associated with survival. However, the prognostic significance of GFR might be different according to the formula used to estimate it. We aimed at comparing the association between GFR estimated using three different formulas and 1-year survival in elderly patients discharged from acute care hospitals. METHODS: Our series consisted of 439 patients aged 65 and older admitted to 11 acute care medical wards enrolled in a multicentre prospective observational study. GFR was estimated by body surface area-adjusted Cockcroft-Gault (CG-BSA), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulas. The relative risk of mortality in patients with estimated GFR = 30-59.9 or < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) compared to people with estimated GFR >/= 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was calculated using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Participants with reduced GFR showed an increased mortality, regardless of the equation used, and the highest one was associated with CG-BSA-estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). After adjusting for potential confounders, CKD-EPI-estimated GFR remained significantly associated with the outcome [30-59.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), hazard ratio (HR) = 1.70, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.02-2.98; < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.20-5.66], while the strength of the association was clearly reduced for MDRD (30-59.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.83-2.38; < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.01-4.30) and CG-BSA (30-59.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 1.79, 95% CI = 0.67-4.53; < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 2.68, 95% CI = 0.92-7.55). CONCLUSION: GFR adds to the list of prognostic indicators in elderly and frail people, and CKD-EPI-derived GFR, which outperforms to some extent MDRD and CG-BSA-derived GFR in a multivariable predictive model, seems worthy of testing in wider populations.

N2  - We present a 77-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with
nephrotic-range proteinuria, microhematuria, renal impairment, and
extremely elevated blood pressure. She had a long history of
well-controlled type 2 diabetes. Renal biopsy revealed fibrillary
deposits in the mesangium and glomerular basement membrane consistent
with fibrillary glomerulopathy (FGN), with crescentic changes and
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). We could not identify any
radiological, clinical, or laboratory evidence of autoimmune disorders,
lymphoproliferative disorders, and malignancy. It was decided not to
offer her any immunosuppressive therapy, as she was frail with
substantial renal damage on the biopsy. Five months after presentation,
she gradually progressed to requiring renal replacement therapy and is
currently on maintenance hemodialysis. Crescentic changes in FGN, though
rare, have been previously described, but the concurrent presence of TMA
has never been previously reported. (c) 2018 The Author(s) Published by

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty among CKD patients
N2  - Frailty in the elderly is a state of vulnerability to poor resolution of homoeostasis after a stressor event and is a consequence of cumulative decline in many physiological systems during a lifetime. This cumulative decline depletes homoeostatic reserves until minor stressor events trigger disproportionate changes in health status. It is usually associated to adverse health outcomes and to one-year mortality risk. Physical exercise has found to be effective in preventing frailty and disability in this population. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a clinical condition where protein energy-wasting, sarcopenia and dynapenia ,very common symptoms in the frail elderly, may occur. Moreover elderly and CKD patients are both affected by an impaired physical performance that may be reversed by physical exercise with an improvement of the survival rate. These similarities suggest that frailty may be a common pathway of aging and CKD that may induce disability and that can be prevented by a multidimensional approach in which physical exercise plays an important role.

suggest that hospitalizations caused by frailty in children with chronic diseases leads to iatrogenic infections.
N2  - OBJECTIVE: The risk of invasive pneumococcal disease is increased among children  with some chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to quantify the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in a wide range of chronic diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases of invasive pneumococcal disease among children (aged 0-17 years) were identified from 1977 through 2005 by using a national surveillance program in Denmark. Rate ratios were assessed in a case-control study by using 10 age- and gender-matched controls per case. Chronic diseases were defined a priori. RESULTS: Among 1655 children with invasive pneumococcal disease, 19% had a history of chronic disease, according to our definition, versus 5% of controls. An increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease was observed for children followed >30 days after initial hospital contact for a chronic disease, but it was also increased in children with >or=5 hospital contacts for any other reason. Children with a history of cancer, chronic renal disease, splenectomy, and transplantation were particularly susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease. Adjusted for number of hospital contacts, the risk for children with other types of chronic disease was 1.4-fold more than for those with hospital contacts for any reason. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer, chronic renal diseases, splenectomy, and transplantation were strongly associated with an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in children. For children with other chronic diseases, their excess risk seemed to be attributable mostly to frail children having repeated hospital contact rather than their underlying condition.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the general population and adults with chronic diseases, however prognostic data for periodontitis in the setting of kidney failure are sparse. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether periodontitis was prognostic for all‐cause and cardiovascular‐related death in adults with kidney failure. Methods: ORALD is a multinational cohort study in adults with kidney failure treated with haemodialysis in Europe (France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain) and Argentina. Periodontitis was measured at baseline according to theWorld Health Organization Community Periodontal Index. The outcomes were all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality. Analyses were conducted using a fixed‐effect Cox proportional hazards analysis and additionally using a random effects model fitted using shared frailty to account for clustering within countries. Results: Periodontitis was evaluable in 3338 dentate participants of which 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe periodontitis. During 6150 person‐years of follow‐up, 650 deaths occurred of which 325 were cardiovascular. In multivariable analyses, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a lower hazard of all‐cause (HR 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (0.69, 0.54 to 0.87) mortality. There was evidence of decreasing mortality risks with more severe periodontal disease (P<0.001 for trend). However, when analyses accounted for clustering of participants within countries, the associations between periodontitis and all‐cause (0.92, 0.75 to 1.11) and cardiovascular (0.83, 0.63 to 1.09) mortality were not significant. Similar results were observed in analyses restricted to participants with 12 or more teeth and when competing risks for cardiovascular death were considered. Conclusions: Unlike in the general population, there is limited evidence that periodontitis is independently associated with increased all‐cause or cardiovascular mortality in adults with kidney failure.

N2  - Dialysis management is changing over time due to the changing dialysis population, with many overlapping issues between gerontological and nephrological care. The conditions that are focused on in this review are frailty, cognitive impairment, depression and changes in body composition. These factors should be considered when managing older patients on dialysis.

N2  - Recent studies have provided the impetus to update the recommendations for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). This article provides guidance on the implementation of CRT and is intended to serve as a framework for the implementation of CRT within the Canadian health care system and beyond. These guidelines were developed through a critical evaluation of the existing literature, and expert consensus. The panel unanimously adopted each recommendation. The 9 recommendations relate to patient selection in the presence of comorbidities, delivery and optimization of CRT, and resources required to deliver this therapy. The strength of evidence was weighed, taking full consideration of any risk of bias, and any imprecision, inconsistency, and indirectness of the available data. The strength of each recommendation and the quality of evidence were adjudicated. Trade-offs between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies were considered, as were values, preferences, and resource availability. These guidelines were externally reviewed by experts, modified based on those reviews, and will be updated as new knowledge is acquired.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: The Fried frailty phenotype, a measure of physiologic reserve defined by 5 components (exhaustion, unintentional weight loss, low physical activity, slow walking speed, and poor grip strength), is associated with poor outcomes among ESRD patients. However, these 5 components may not fully capture physiologic reserve in this population. We aimed to ascertain opinions of ESRD clinicians and patients about the usefulness of the Fried frailty phenotype and interventions to improve frailty in ESRD patients, and to identify novel components to further characterize frailty in ESRD. METHODS: Clinicians who treat adults with ESRD completed a 2-round Delphi study (n = 41 and n = 36, respectively; response rate = 87%). ESRD patients completed a survey at transplant evaluation (n = 460; response rate = 81%). We compared clinician and patient opinions on the constituent components of frailty. RESULTS: Clinicians were more likely than patients to say that ESRD makes patients frail (97.6% vs. 60.2%). There was consensus among clinicians that exhaustion, low physical activity, slow walking speed, and poor grip strength characterize frailty in ESRD patients; however, 29% of clinicians thought weight loss was not relevant. Patients were less likely than clinicians to say that the 5 Fried frailty components were relevant. Clinicians identified 10 new ESRD-specific potential components including falls (64%), physical decline (61%), and cognitive impairment (39%). Clinicians (83%) and patients (80%) agreed that intradialytic foot-peddlers might make ESRD patients less frail. CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus among clinicians and moderate consensus among patients that frailty is more common in ESRD. Weight loss was not seen as relevant, but new components were identified. These findings are first steps in refining the frailty phenotype and identifying interventions to improve physiologic reserve specific to ESRD patients.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Selecting peritoneal dialysis (PD) in older individuals is a complex, multi-step  process. At each step, older individuals may not have the opportunity to receive PD unless care is optimized. Older individuals are less likely to complete a PD assessment, because of unstable medical conditions, consideration of palliative care, or reluctance to approach frail patients once they are established on hemodialysis (HD). Older individuals are also more likely to have medical or social conditions that contraindicate PD or to have barriers to self-care PD that may not be overcome with support. Older individuals who are eligible for PD may be reluctant to choose it, leaving HD as the default modality. Finally, receipt of PD may be compromised by urgent HD or PD catheter-related complications at the time of insertion. Despite all these challenges, older patients can do very well on PD, so each step should be well understood and optimized in renal programs to maximize PD use in older patients.

N2  - Objective: To determine the association between hypertension at age 90
years, treatment, and 5-year mortality.
Design: A prospective observational study of a representative
community-dwelling birth cohort (born 1920-1921) by the Jerusalem
Longitudinal Study (1990-2015).
Setting: Home-assessment.
Participants: 480 subjects aged 90, examined 2010-2011. Measurements and
Main Outcome: Hypertension was defined as treatment with
antihypertensive medication, and/or sitting blood pressure (BP) > 140
mmHg systolic or >90 mmHg diastolic. Subjects were categorized as
normotensive (NORMO), untreated hypertensive (NonTx-HTN), and treated
hypertensive (Tx-HTN); assessment included activities of daily living
(ADL), handgrip strength, and all-cause mortality (2010-2015).
Results: NORMO, NonTx-HTN, and Tx-HTN prevalence was 12.3% (59/480),
12.7% (61/480), and 75% (360/480). Tx-HTN had higher rates of low
education, depression, low physical activity, chronic heart failure,
ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease. Five-year survival was
lowest among Tx-HTN and highest among NonTx-HTN versus NORMO among all
subjects (51%, 72%, 61%; P = .01), and subgroups with ADL
independence (64%, 91%, 74%; n = 265, P = .01), ADL dependence (37%,
55%, 48%; n = 194, P = .36), high grip strength (66%, 85%, 83%; n =
227, P = .04), low grip strength (38%, 60%, 61%; n = 149, P = .06),
low comorbidity (64%, 84%, 70%; n = 219, P = .13), and high
comorbidity (42%, 60%, 54%; n = 257, P = .12). Unadjusted mortality
hazards ratios (HR) were higher for Tx-HTN {[}HR 1.38; 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.89-2.15] versus NonTx-HTN (HR 0.7; 95% CI 0.37-1.31)
compared to NORMO (HR 1.0). After adjusting for medical and functional
covariates, adjusted HRs were higher for Tx-HTN (HR 1.39; 95% CI
0.83-2.33) versus NonTx-HTN (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.31-1.45) compared to
NORMO (HR 1.0). Findings were consistent in subsets according to ADL
status, grip strength, and comorbidity.
Conclusions: Untreated hypertension at age 90 years was not associated
with increased mortality risk among community-dwelling elderly,
irrespective of comorbidity, functional status, or muscle strength. (C)

N2  - Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements  among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; >/=15 days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95% CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy, which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

N2  - Evidence has recently been building that the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent contributor to decline in physical and cognitive functions in older adults. CKD affects 45% of persons older than 70 years of age and can double the risk for physical impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and frailty. To increase awareness of this relatively new concept of CKD as a risk factor for accelerated aging, we review studies on the association of CKD with physical function, frailty, and cognitive function. We also present a summary of the proposed mechanisms for these associations.

Dialysis patients with QRS longer than 120 ms had significantly lower severity of frailty than those with QRS less than 120 ms (p = 0.01 for the Edmonton frailty scale and 0.05 for simple FRAIL scale). Regression analysis showed that frailty severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale and simple FRAIL scale, was significantly associated with QRS duration independent of serum electrolyte levels.

.

QRS duration as dependent variable
N2  - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death, the risk of which is presumably related to arrhythmia. Electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters have been found to correlate with arrhythmia and predict cardiovascular outcomes in ESRD patients. Frailty is also a common feature in this population. We investigate whether the severity of dialysis frailty is associated with ECG findings, including PR interval, QRS duration, and QTc interval. Presence and severity of frailty was ascertained using six different self-report questionnaires with proven construct validity. Correlation analysis between frailty severity and ECG was made, and those with significant association entered into multiple regression analysis for confirmation. Among a cohort of chronic hemodialysis patients, we found that frailty severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale, is significantly associated with QRS duration (r = - 0.3, p < 0.05). Dialysis patients with QRS longer than 120 ms had significantly lower severity of frailty than those with QRS less than 120 ms (p = 0.01 for the Edmonton frailty scale and 0.05 for simple FRAIL scale). Regression analysis showed that frailty severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale and simple FRAIL scale, was significantly associated with QRS duration independent of serum electrolyte levels. In conclusion, a significant relationship exists between the severity of frailty and QRS duration in ESRD patients. This might be an under-recognized link between frailty and its adverse cardiovascular impact in these patients.

N2  - We investigated the burden of frailty across the spectrum of
ankle-brachial index (ABI < 0.9, 0.9 <= ABI < 1.1, 1.1 <= ABI < 1.4 and
>= 1.4) using data from the National Health and Nutritional Examination
Survey (NHANES) in respondents aged > 50 years. Criteria used to
identify frailty status included weight loss, slow walking speed,
weakness, exhaustion, and low physical activity. Participants meeting 1
to 2 criteria were classified as prefrail, and those meeting >= 3
criteria were classified as frail. Prevalence of frailty in respondents
with ABI < 0.9 (17.5%) and 0.9 <= ABI < 1.1 (6.7%) was higher than in
participants with normal ABI-1.1 <= ABI < 1.4 (4.7%). In multivariable
multinomial logistic regression models, ABI < 0.9 predicted frailty
(odds ratio {[}OR] = 2.31, 95% confidence interval {[}CI] = 1.08-4.94)
and prefrailty (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 0.90-2.07). Higher prevalence of
frailty was seen in participants with ABI >= 1.4 (7.3%), P = .39.
Frailty predicted general and cardiovascular mortality in participants
with ABI < 0.9. Frailty mediates increased morbidity and mortality seen
in peripheral arterial disease (PAD).

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - CONTEXT: There are few data on the frequency and current management of clinical ethical issues related to care of seriously ill dialysis patients in free-standing dialysis facilities. OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent of clinical ethical challenges experienced by care providers in free-standing facilities and their perceptions about how those issues are managed. METHODS: A total of 183 care providers recruited from 15 facilities in North Carolina completed a survey regarding the occurrence and management of ethical issues in the past year. Care plan meetings were observed at four of the facilities for three consecutive months. Also, current policies and procedures at each of the facilities were reviewed. RESULTS: The two most frequently experienced challenges involved dialyzing frail patients with multiple comorbidities and caring for disruptive/difficult patients. The most common ways of managing ethical issues were discussions in care plan meetings (n = 47) or discussions with the clinic manager (n = 47). Although policies were in place to guide management of some of the challenges, respondents were often not aware of those policies. Also, although participants reported that ethical issues related to dialyzing undocumented immigrants were fairly common, no facility had a policy for managing this challenge. Participants suggested that all staff obtain training in clinical ethics and communication skills, facilities develop ethics teams, and there be clear policies to guide management of ethical challenges. CONCLUSION: The scope of ethical challenges was extensive, how these challenges were managed varied widely, and there were limited resources for assistance. Multifaceted efforts, encompassing endeavors at the individual, facility, organization, and national levels, are needed to support staff in improving the management of ethical challenges in dialysis facilities.

N2  - As the population ages, the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in older people is rising. Nursing home residents are predominantly older and account for up to 4.8% of the ESRD population. This group of patients are frail and comorbid with multiple symptoms and cognitive impairment. Survival is poor in the older patient with ESRD, with the 1-year mortality rate approaching 35%. Therefore, managing such patients can be particularly challenging. The debate continues as to how best approach the management of ESRD in this high-risk group. This article discusses the dialysis options for nursing home residents, highlighting the potential advantages and disadvantages of each. It advocates conservative care as a valid alternative in this population. It also discusses the need for a multidisciplinary approach to medical care and advance care planning for end of life.

N2  - Objective: Recruitment is one of the most serious challenges in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), especially in the old and frail population. A Norwegian multicentre RCT targeting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients older than 70 years was initiated to compare the impact on quality of life of early or late start of dialysis. Owing to poor inclusion the RCT was closed. The aim of the present study was to explore possible reasons for the recruitment failure.; Material and Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to all Norwegian nephrologists. The questionnaire presented 11 statements which cited possible reasons for not including elderly ESRD patients in the RCT in question.; Results: The highest rated reasons for non-inclusion were the physician's wish to decide the timing of dialysis individually and the patient's wish to postpone the start of treatment. High mean scores were also found for reasons related to workload and capacity at the dialysis unit, whereas the influence of the doctor-patient relationship and competing studies were judged not to be important.; Conclusions: The results indicate that confidence in individually decided treatment and fear of losing professional autonomy make Norwegian nephrologists reluctant to include patients in RCTs. To succeed in recruitment, there seems to be a need for cultural changes as well as increased resources to meet practical challenges.;

N2  - Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with reduced health-related
quality of life (HRQL). However, the relationship between pre-dialysis
CKD, HRQL and clinical outcomes, including mortality and progression to
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is unclear.
Methods
All 745 participants recruited into the Renal Impairment In Secondary
Care study to end March 2014 were included. Demographic, clinical and
laboratory data were collected at baseline including an assessment of
HRQL using the Euroqol EQ-5D-3L. Health states were converted into an
EQ-5D(index) score using a set of weighted preferences specific to the
UK population. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression and
competing risk analyses were undertaken to evaluate the association of
HRQL with progression to ESRD or all cause mortality. Regression
analyses were then performed to identify variables associated with the
significant HRQL components.
Results
Median eGFR was 25.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (IQR 19.6-33.7ml/min) and median
ACR was 33 mg/mmol (IQR 6.6-130.3 mg/mmol). Five hundred and fifty five
participants (75.7%) reported problems with one or more EQ-5D domains.
When adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity, eGFR and ACR, both reported
problems with self-care {[}hazard ratio 2.542, 95% confidence interval
1.222-5.286, p = 0.013] and reduced EQ-5D(index) score {[}hazard ratio
0.283, 95% confidence interval 0.099-0.810, p = 0.019] were
significantly associated with an increase in all-cause mortality.
Similar findings were observed for competing risk analyses. Reduced HRQL
was not a risk factor for progression to ESRD in multivariable analyses.
Conclusions
Impaired HRQL is common in the pre-dialysis CKD population. Reduced
HRQL, as demonstrated by problems with self-care or a lower EQ-5D(index)
score, is associated with a higher risk for death but not ESRD. Multiple
factors influence these aspects of HRQL but renal function, as measured
by eGFR and ACR, are not among them.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Environmental lead and cadmium exposure is associated with higher risk of several age-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis. These diseases may lead to frailty, a geriatric syndrome characterized by diminished physiologic reserve in multiple systems with decreased ability to cope with acute stressors. However, no previous study has evaluated the association between lead or cadmium exposure and frailty. METHODS: Cross-sectional study among individuals aged >/= 60 years who participated in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and had either blood lead (N=5272) or urine cadmium (N=4887) determinations. Frailty was ascertained with a slight modification of the Fried criteria, so that individuals meeting >/= 3 of 5 pre-defined criteria (exhaustion, low body weight, low physical activity, weakness and slow walking speed), were considered as frail. The association between lead and cadmium with frailty was evaluated using logistic regression with adjustment for relevant confounders. RESULTS: Median (intertertile range) concentrations of blood lead and urine cadmium were 3.9 microg/dl (2.9-4.9) and 0.62 microg/l (0.41-0.91), respectively. The prevalence of frailty was 7.1%. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of frailty comparing the second and third to the lowest tertile of blood lead were, respectively, 1.40 (0.96-2.04) and 1.75 (1.33-2.31). Lead concentrations were also associated with the frequency of exhaustion, weakness and slowness. The corresponding odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for cadmium were, respectively, 0.97 (0.68-1.39) and 1.55 (1.03-2.32), but this association did not hold after excluding participants with reduced glomerular filtration rate: 0.70 (0.43-1.14) and 1.09 (0.56-2.11), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the US older adult population, blood lead but not urine cadmium concentrations showed a direct dose-response relationship with frailty. These findings support that lead exposure increases frailty in older adults.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate hypertension (HTN) management in patients 80 years of age and older who reside in a large, long-term care (LTC) facility. DATA SOURCE: A retrospective chart audit was conducted on 75 charts of patients 80 years of age and older and who had a diagnosis of HTN. Using the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) Expert Consensus Document on Management of Hypertension in the Elderly as a guide, blood pressure readings, significant comorbidities, and antihypertensive medication utilization were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: LTC residents in this sample were often not treated according to expert recommendations. Specifically, analysis revealed overtreatment of uncomplicated HTN and undertreatment of those with comorbid conditions. Additionally, those with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease were infrequently prescribed ace inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, as recommended. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Utilizing evidence-based practice (EBP) guidelines affords the best avenue for providing safe and effective treatment of HTN. While expert recommendations are available, researchers seldom recruit frail elders in LTC facilities into treatment investigations. In the absence of population-specific EBP guidelines, nurse practitioners must rely on expert opinion and diagnostic reasoning to individualize HTN treatment to this unique and vulnerable population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The majority of dialysis patients are elderly, and the trend towards  even more elderly people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will further determine the dialysis field in the future. METHOD: If these elderly ESRD patients do not opt for conservative ESRD care, they may still qualify for peritoneal dialysis (PD), which may be assisted or unassisted. RESULTS: Although they may be more frail and have a greater co-morbidity burden compared to their younger counterparts, elderly patients with ESRD may still be able to maintain a good functionality level with adequate quality of life by performing PD, which may be assisted (treatment performed or supported e.g. by partner or nurse) or unassisted (without support). PD may indeed further contribute to maintaining autonomy, and enhance quality of life compared to in-center conventional hemodialysis. In order to illustrate this strategy, we hereby describe a centenarian patient with ESRD who received assisted PD successfully. CONCLUSIONS: With appropriate management and infrastructure, (very) high age is not a contra-indication for PD.

N2  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frail patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased hospitalisation and mortality rate. However, many popular frailty screening methods have not been validated in patients with CKD. This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of several frailty screening methods in patients with CKD G4-5 and those established on haemodialysis (G5D). METHODS: Ninety participants with CKD G4-5D were recruited from Nephrology Outpatient Clinics and 2 Haemodialysis Units between December 2016 and December 2017. Frailty was diagnosed using the Fried Frailty Phenotype. The following frailty screening tests were evaluated: Clinical Frailty Scale, PRISMA-7, CKD Frailty Index, CKD FI-LAB, walking speed, hand grip strength and Short Physical Performance Battery. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 69 years (SD +/-13). One-third of participants were dialysis-dependent. Nineteen (21%) patients were categorised as frail, 42 (47%) as pre-frail and 29 (32%) as robust. Overall, walking speed was the most discriminative measure (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.93-1.00], sensitivity 0.84 [95% CI 0.62-0.94], specificity 0.96 [95% CI 0.88-0.99]). The Clinical Frailty Scale had the best performance of the non-physical assessment frailty screening methods (AUC 0.90 [95% CI 0.84-0.97], sensitivity 0.79 [95% CI 0.57-0.91], specificity 0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: Walking speed can be used to accurately screen for frailty in CKD populations. If it is not practical to perform a physical assessment to screen for frailty, the Clinical Frailty Scale is a useful alternative.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty has been increasingly used as a prognostic indicator for various surgical operations. Patients with peripheral arterial disease represent a cohort of population with advanced medical comorbidities. The aim of this study is to correlate the postoperative outcomes after lower extremity bypass surgery with preoperative modified frailty index (mFI). METHODS: Using 2010 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial bypass surgery were identified. mFI with 11 variables, based on the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index, was utilized. Based on mFI score, the patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 (mFI score: 0-0.09), group 2 (mFI score: 0.18-0.27), group 3 (mFI score: 0.36-0.45), and group 4 (mFI score: 0.54-0.63). A bivariate and multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 4,704 patients (64% males and 36% females) underwent infrainguinal arterial bypass. Mean age was 67.9 +/- 11.7 years. Distribution of patients based on mFI was as follows: group 1: 14.6%, group 2: 55.9%, group 3: 26.9%, and group 4: 2.6%. Increase in mFI was associated with higher mortality rates. Incidence of mortality for group 1 was 0.6%; for group 2, it was 1.4%; for group 3, it was 4%; and for group 4, it was 7.4%. Likewise, the incidence of other postoperative complications such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, progressive renal failure, and graft failure was significantly high among patients with high mFI scores. Following factors were associated with increased risk of mortality: high mFI score, black race, dialysis dependency, postoperative renal insufficiency, MI, and postoperative acute renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the mFI can be used as a valuable tool to identify patients at a higher risk for developing postoperative complications after lower extremity revascularization. For patients with mFI score of 0.54-0.63, the risk of mortality and complications increases significantly. mFI can be used as a useful screening tool to identify patients who are at a high risk for developing complications.

N2  - Older patients on dialysis have unique needs and characteristics and their outcomes vary from that of their younger counterparts. Comparatively fewer will start or be maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to younger patients, despite the fact that hemodialysis is often poorly tolerated. Barriers to PD for older patients include poor vision, frailty, cognitive dysfunction, accommodation issues, and a bias from renal teams that older patients cannot do PD. The development of assisted PD can overcome many of these barriers. The ability of older patients to use PD as their dialysis modality should not be determined by whether they live in an area where the nephrologist is a PD enthusiast. All patients should be given nonbiased information so they can choose the dialysis modality that gives them the best quality of life and suits their and their family's lifestyle.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Recruitment is one of the most serious challenges in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), especially in the old and frail population. A Norwegian multicentre RCT targeting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients older than 70 years was initiated to compare the impact on quality of life of early or late start of dialysis. Owing to poor inclusion the RCT was closed. The aim of the present study was to explore possible reasons for the recruitment failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to all Norwegian nephrologists. The questionnaire presented 11 statements which cited possible reasons for not including elderly ESRD patients in the RCT in question. RESULTS: The highest rated reasons for non-inclusion were the physician's wish to decide the timing of dialysis individually and the patient's wish to postpone the start of treatment. High mean scores were also found for reasons related to workload and capacity at the dialysis unit, whereas the influence of the doctor-patient relationship and competing studies were judged not to be important. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that confidence in individually decided treatment and fear of losing professional autonomy make Norwegian nephrologists reluctant to include patients in RCTs. To succeed in recruitment, there seems to be a need for cultural changes as well as increased resources to meet practical challenges.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Many older adults have decreased kidney function. Practitioners should be informed that no single clinical assessment method is validated in predicting their kidney function. DATA SOURCES: Primary literature identified through MEDLINE/PubMed (1950-2010) and EMBASE (1980-2010) databases. The search was limited to English language, human subjects, and individuals 65 years of age and older. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Research, review articles, and additional publications related to geriatric, elderly, kidney function assessment, and cystatin C. DATA SYNTHESIS: Screening and diagnosing chronic kidney disease are a challenge in older adults partially because of muscle loss and frailty. The various tools used to estimate creatinine clearance (Clcr) are not validated and may lead to under- or overdiagnosis of kidney function. The clinician must be cautious when using and interpreting results from these values. RESULTS: Estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with either the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) or Cockcroft-Gault (Clcr) formulae yielded better predictions of kidney function when compared with creatinine alone, or to measured Clcr. These estimation methods should be used in clinical practice to provide a better estimation of kidney function in older adults until a more valid assessment tool becomes available. CONCLUSIONS: There is no proven valid method for eGFR in older adults; however, the CG and MDRD equations are routinely applied in clinical practice. Kidney function assessment in older adults remains a challenge, and practitioners should know their limitations.

Rates of family-reported excellent quality of end-of-life care
N2  - IMPORTANCE: Efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on patients with cancer. High-quality end-of-life care is also critical for patients with other illnesses. OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of end-of-life care and family-rated quality of care for patients dying with different serious illnesses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in all 146 inpatient facilities within the Veteran Affairs health system among patients who died in inpatient facilities between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2012, with clinical diagnoses categorized as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cancer, cardiopulmonary failure (congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), dementia, frailty, or other conditions. Data analysis was conducted from April 1, 2014, to February 10, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Palliative care consultations, do-not-resuscitate orders, death in inpatient hospices, death in the intensive care unit, and family-reported quality of end-of-life care. RESULTS: Among 57753 decedents, approximately half of the patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty received palliative care consultations (adjusted proportions, 50.4%, 46.7%, and 43.7%, respectively) vs 73.5% of patients with cancer and 61.4% of patients with dementia (P < .001). Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty (adjusted proportions, 32.3%, 34.1%, and 35.2%, respectively) died in the intensive care unit, more than double the rates among patients with cancer and those with dementia (13.4% and 8.9%, respectively) (P < .001). Rates of excellent quality of end-of-life care reported by 34005 decedents' families were similar for patients with cancer and those with dementia (adjusted proportions, 59.2% and 59.3%; P = .61), but lower for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty (54.8%, 54.8%, and 53.7%, respectively; all P </= .02 vs patients with cancer). This quality advantage was mediated by palliative care consultation, setting of death, and a code status of do-not-resuscitate; adjustment for these variables rendered the association between diagnosis and overall end-of-life care quality nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Family-reported quality of end-of-life care was significantly better for patients with cancer and those with dementia than for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty, largely owing to higher rates of palliative care consultation and do-not-resuscitate orders and fewer deaths in the intensive care unit among patients with cancer and those with dementia. Increasing access to palliative care and goals of care discussions that address code status and preferred setting of death, particularly for patients with end-organ failure and frailty, may improve the overall quality of end-of-life care for Americans dying of these illnesses.

N2  - Background: Physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning are
frequently impaired in dialysis patients and impairment in these domains
relates to poor outcome. The aim of this analysis was to compare the
prevalence of impairment as measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of
Life-Short Form (KDQOL-SF) subscales between the different age
categories and to assess whether the association of these subscales with
mortality differs between younger and older dialysis patients.
Methods: This study included data from 714 prevalent hemodialysis
patients, from 26 centres, who were enrolled in the CONvective TRAnsport
STudy (CONTRAST NCT00205556, 09-12-2005). Baseline HRQOL domains were
evaluated for patients < 65 years, 65-74 years and over 75 years.
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to assess
the relation between the separate domains and 2-year mortality.
Results: Emotional health was higher in patients over the age of 75
compared to younger patients (mean level 71, 73 and 77 for increasing
age categories respectively, p = 0.02), whilst physical functioning was
significantly lower in older patients (mean level 60, 48 and 40, p <
0.01). A low level of physical functioning (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.72 {[}
95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.02-2.73]), emotional health (HR 1.85 {[}
95% 1.30-2.63]), and social functioning (HR 1.59 {[} 95% CI
1.12-2.26]), was individually associated with an increased 2-year
mortality within the whole population. The absence of effect
modification suggests no evidence for different relations within the
older age groups.
Conclusions: In dialysis patients, older age is associated with lower
levels of physical functioning, whilst the level of emotional health is
not associated with age. KDQOL-SF domains physical functioning,
emotional health and social functioning are independently associated
with mortality in prevalent younger and older hemodialysis patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Older dialysis patients have a high burden of mortality and morbidity. Frailty and functional disability are common. One of the main determinants of functional disability in nondialysis populations is acute hospitalization. Such episodes are predictive of increased mortality and a future need for long-term care. Based on the high prevalence of disability in the dialysis population, we undertook a pilot study to determine functional impairment at the time of admission and again at 1 week after discharge. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prevalent dialysis patients older than 65 years admitted to a single acute-care institution during a 3-month period. OUTCOMES: The proportion of dialysis patients with difficulty with activities of daily living at baseline and 1 week after discharge. MEASUREMENT: Basic activities of daily living; Lawton Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score; timed up-and-go and handgrip tests; Trails A & B, and the clock test. RESULTS: At the time of admission, only 8 of 35 individuals reported being independent with basic activities of daily living. None of the patients was independent with instrumental activities of daily living. At 1 week after discharge, patients showed deterioration in all aspects of function except the ability to use the telephone and manage their financial affairs. A total of 73.3% of patients (95% confidence interval, 54.1 to 87.7) experienced a decline in personal functional independence in association with hospitalization. LIMITATIONS: This is a pilot study with a small number of patients who were studied at only 2 times (admission and 1 week after discharge). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that hospitalization is associated with a high rate of disability in elderly dialysis patients. Further study is required to determine whether the functional deterioration seen with hospitalization improves over time.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Novel urinary kidney damage biomarkers detect AKI after cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB-AKI). Although there is growing focus on whether AKI leads to CKD, no studies have assessed whether novel urinary biomarkers remain elevated long term after CPB-AKI. We assessed whether there was clinical or biomarker evidence of long-term kidney injury in patients with CPB-AKI. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We performed a cross-sectional evaluation for signs of chronic kidney injury using both traditional measures and novel urinary biomarkers in a population of 372 potentially eligible children (119 AKI positive and 253 AKI negative) who underwent surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass for congenital heart disease at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center between 2004 and 2007. A total of 51 patients (33 AKI positive and 18 AKI negative) agreed to long-term assessment. We also compared the urinary biomarker levels in these 51 patients with those in healthy controls of similar age. RESULTS: At long-term follow-up (mean duration+/-SD, 7+/-0.98 years), AKI-positive and AKI-negative patients had similarly normal assessments of kidney function by eGFR, proteinuria, and BP measurement. However, AKI-positive patients had higher urine concentrations of IL-18 (48.5 pg/ml versus 20.3 pg/ml [P=0.01] and 20.5 pg/ml [P<0.001]) and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) (5.9 ng/ml versus 3.9 ng/ml [P=0.001] and 3.2 ng/ml [P<0.001]) than did AKI-negative patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Novel urinary biomarkers remain elevated 7 years after an episode of CPB-AKI in children. However, there is no conventional evidence of CKD in these children. These biomarkers may be a more sensitive marker of chronic kidney injury after CPB-AKI. Future studies are needed to understand the clinical relevance of persistent elevations in IL-18, kidney injury molecule-1, and L-FABP in assessments for potential long-term kidney consequences of CPB-AKI.

N2  - The impact of type 2 diabetes on ageing societies is great and
populations across the globe are becoming more diverse. Complications of
diabetes unequally affect particular groups in the UK older people, and
people with a South Asian background are two population groups with
increased risk whose numbers will grow in the future. We explored the
evidence about diabetes care for older people with South Asian ethnicity
to understand the contexts and mechanisms behind interventions to reduce
inequalities. We used a realist approach to review the literature,
mapped the main areas where relevant evidence exists, and explored the
concepts and mechanisms which underpinned interventions. From this we
constructed a theoretical framework for a programme of research and put
forward suggestions for what our analysis might mean to providers,
researchers, and policy makers. Broad themes of cultural competency;
comorbidities and stratification; and access emerged as mid-level
mechanisms which have individualised, culturally intelligent, and
ethical care at their heart and through which inequalities can be
addressed. These provide a theoretical framework for future research to
advance knowledge about concordance; culturally meaningful measures of
depression and cognitive impairment; and care planning in different
contexts which support effective diabetes care for aging and diverse
populations.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailyt in CKD patients
N2  - The initiation of dialysis is often not reasonable in very old patients
with high comorbidities. This is especially true for patients who are
geriatrically described as frail and show cognitive and executive
function deficits. For estimation of the impairments, scores and
standardized tests are more suitable than clinical experience or the
surprise question. During the clarification for geriatric patients about
the imminent need for dialysis, in addition to the options of various
dialysis procedures the option of conservative treatment should also be
discussed. In no way should all geriatric patients be given false hopes
and the prospect that after beginning dialysis the health-related
problems will be drastically improved. This is only the case with very
few patients. Often only a stabilization of the condition can be
achieved. In the case of conservative treatment an intensive orientation
to the symptoms is more important than treatment to avoid delayed
sequelae of dialysis. Inclusion in the palliative medicine network seems
to be advisable. Initiation of dialysis treatment should be carried out
by onset of uremia or other complications. A premature initiation of
dialysis treatment is not meaningful in geriatric patients; however,
there seems to be no doubt that dialysis in relatively healthy geriatric
patients increases the survival rate. Focusing on symptom control and
quality of life should be given priority in geriatric patients. A
rehabilitation treatment before or after starting dialysis can possibly
contribute to stabilization.

physical health and kidney disease effects component of KDQoL
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Frailty among the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population is highly prevalent and has been associated with mortality. Little is known about the relation of different aspects of body composition, a modifiable risk factor, with the risk of frailty in ESRD population. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-one patients including 85 men and 66 women, aged >/=18 years with ESRD who had been receiving conventional maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for at least 3 months were included. Body fat and muscle mass from both bioimpedance spectroscopy and skin-fold thickness and waist circumference as a surrogate of abdominal obesity were measured. Frailty was defined based on Fried's criteria. Health-related quality of life was collected using the RAND version of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36) Survey. RESULTS: We performed single and multiple predictor logistic regression analyses to determine factors associated with frailty. After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, fat mass (both by bioimpedance spectroscopy and anthropometry) and waist circumference, but not muscle mass remained the main predictors of frailty. The odds ratio of frailty in the third tertile compared with the first was 4.97 (1.70-14.55) and 3.84 (1.39-10.61) for fat mass and waist circumference, respectively (P for trends for both <.05). The scores of physical health and kidney disease effect component of quality of life were lower in frail compared with nonfrail patients (40.7 +/- 9.2 vs. 33.7 +/- 10.2, P < .01 and 66.8 +/- 22.4 vs. 51.6 +/- 25.7, P < .05 for physical health and effects of disease, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, which is associated with poor outcomes in chronic HD patients, is common and predicted by fat mass and waist circumference but not by body mass index and muscle mass. Interventions to modify abdominal obesity, reflected by waist circumference, could potentially lower the incidence of frailty and hence improve the quality of life in the HD population.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here. RECENT FINDINGS: The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy supplementation combined with low-protein diet for the management of CKD may prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23 mEq/l for nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven. SUMMARY: Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing comorbidities.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Patients suffering from end-stage renal disease experience multiple disabilities, such as muscle wasting, weakness, higher postural sway, and fall rates compared with healthy population, which has a negative effect on physical functioning and autonomy. The vital treatment of hemodialysis is recognized to induce important post-hemodialysis fatigue, hypotension, cramps, and headache due to the rapid fluid redistribution, among others. Nevertheless, even the well-known negative effect of aforementioned consequences of hemodialysis treatment, its effect on physical function, especially postural balance, is unclear. Thus, this study hypothesized the adverse effect of hemodialysis treatment on postural sway in 12 end-stage renal disease patients (mean age 63.3 +/- 11 years) through the analysis of center-of-pressure (COP) trajectories recorded before and immediately after hemodialysis session. Evident postural alterations were observed at post-hemodialysis balance assessment for COP position-based (Fs < 7.7, P < 0.02) and COP velocity-based variables (Fs > 2.33, P < 0.05), without changes in complexity of COP time series in anteroposterior and mediolateral directions. These results suggest that period after hemodialysis treatment is particularly unsafe, as evidenced by important disability in postural control, and highlight the importance of the medical support and falls-related prevention strategies of these older frail patients after hemodialysis treatment.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Abnormal bone architecture contributes to high incidence of hip fractures in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients. Their clinical epidemiology is incompletely described.We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the implications of hospitalization with hip fracture in HD patients compared to the non‐CKD population. Methods: Thirty three chronic HD patients admitted with hip fracture over 5 years were age‐ and sex‐matched on a 1:1 ratio with controls that had hip fracture and normal renal function. Demographic characteristics, deaths and readmissions at 6 months, hospitalization length, time to operation and laboratory results were recorded from electronic health files. Data were compared between the two groups using paired t‐test for continuous variables and McNemar's test for categorical variables. Results: The composite end‐point of death and/or readmission at 6 months was higher in HD patients (12.1% versus 6.2%, p<0.001). Furthermore, mean time to operation was more delayed due to comorbidities (4.7 versus 2.9 days, p=0.04). HD patients had more frequently anemia at presentation (hemoglobin below 10 mg/dl, 32.1% versus 12.5%, p=0.003). Finally, they were more likely to be considered too frail for surgery and were not operated (21.2% versus 6.2%, p<0.001). Conclusions: Hip fractures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and represent an important healthcare burden for chronic HD patients. Future research is needed to identify definite predictors of adverse outcomes and to implement prevention strategies.

Among all, frail individuals with ESRD had significantly lower average lumbar spine area, lower L4, FN, and total BMD and T-scores, lower FN and total Z-scores than non-frail ones, without differences in gender, body mass index, dialysis duration, and comorbidities. Furthermore, we discovered frail ESRD patients had significantly more prominent decrease in average lumbar spine area, percentage changes in L1 Z-scores and average lumbar spine area, and a trend toward more prominent decrease in L4 area than non-frail ones after one year of follow-up.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty exhibits a high prevalence in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and is associated with adverse health-related outcomes, including falls and fractures. Available studies do not address whether frailty is associated with temporal changes in BMD. We evaluated this issue by analyzing the follow-up dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results in an ESRD cohort. METHODS: In 2015, we enrolled forty-three ESRD patients, divided into frail, pre-frail, and robust ones based on a validated simple FRAIL scale, all receiving DXA at baseline. After one year of follow-up, survivors received another DXA, and we calculated the absolute and percentage changes in area, bone mineral density (BMD), T-, and Z-scores of lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN) between baseline and follow-up examinations. RESULTS: Among all, frail individuals with ESRD had significantly lower average lumbar spine area, lower L4, FN, and total BMD and T-scores, lower FN and total Z-scores than non-frail ones, without differences in gender, body mass index, dialysis duration, and comorbidities. Furthermore, we discovered frail ESRD patients had significantly more prominent decrease in average lumbar spine area, percentage changes in L1 Z-scores and average lumbar spine area, and a trend toward more prominent decrease in L4 area than non-frail ones after one year of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline frailty might be associated with deteriorating bone health, including shrinking L-spine areas and a more rapid decrease in L-spine Z scores, among ESRD patients. This frailty-bone association should be highlighted during our care of frail individuals with ESRD.

An association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.
N2  - Frailty is a common complication in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under dialysis, which is a strong risk factor for low quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of frailty in a group of Portuguese ESRD patients, and its association with socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. We performed a cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3 [+/-14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire. Social support, data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory markers were also evaluated. Our results confirmed that frailty is a highly prevalent condition in ESRD patients, particularly in female patients. An association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.

N2  - Objective. To analyse the cross-sectional association between measures
of renal function and inflammation in an elderly population and to
evaluate the confounding effect of impaired physical functioning on
these relationships. Material and methods. Cystatin C and creatinine
were measured in serum samples from 1110 elderly subjects in a
community-based cross-sectional survey (Lieto Study) in southwestern
Finland. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by means of the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Associations
between renal measures and sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) and the
impact of functional status were determined by multivariate linear
models. Results. Based on standardized coefficients, cystatin C (beta
0.19; p<0.001) showed the strongest association with CRP compared to
creatinine (beta 0.14; p<0.001) and estimated GFR (beta -0.13; p<0.001).
Levels of CRP linearly increased across quintiles of cystatin C, whereas
for creatinine and estimated GFR the increase was less graded. Impaired
physical functioning was strongly associated with elevated levels of
cystatin C (p<0.001) and CRP (p<0.001), but not with creatinine (p=0.45)
or estimated GFR (p=0.38). For persons with impaired physical
functioning, the odds ratio for belonging to the highest compared to the
lowest cystatin C quintile was 7.04 (95% confidence interval 3.49-14.9;
p<0.001), whereas for creatinine and estimated GFR this difference was
not significant. Conclusion. The weaker association observed between CRP
and creatinine-based measures, as compared to cystatin C, reflects the
misclassification of elderly frail subjects as having normal kidney
function rather than suggests cystatin C itself to be a marker of
inflammation.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: A well-accepted definition of frailty includes measurements of physical performance, which may limit its clinical utility. STUDY DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, we compared prevalence and patient characteristics based on a frailty definition that uses self-reported function to the classic performance-based definition and developed a modified self-report-based definition. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prevalent adult patients receiving hemodialysis in 14 centers around San Francisco and Atlanta in 2009-2011. INDEX TESTS: Self-report-based frailty definition in which a score lower than 75 on the Physical Function scale of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) was substituted for gait speed and grip strength in the classic definition; modified self-report definition with optimized Physical Function score cutoff points derived in a development (one-half) cohort and validated in the other half. REFERENCE TEST: Performance-based frailty defined as 3 of the following: weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed. RESULTS: 387 (53%) patients were frail based on self-reported function, of whom 209 (29% of the cohort) met the performance-based definition. Only 23 (3%) met the performance-based definition of frailty only. The self-report definition had 90% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 54% positive predictive value, 93% negative predictive value, and 72.5% overall accuracy. Intracellular water per kilogram of body weight and serum albumin, prealbumin, and creatinine levels were highest among nonfrail individuals, intermediate among those who were frail by self-report, and lowest among those who also were frail by performance. Age, percentage of body fat, and C-reactive protein level followed an opposite pattern. The modified self-report definition had better accuracy (84%; 95% CI, 79%-89%) and superior specificity (88%) and positive predictive value (67%). LIMITATIONS: Our study did not address prediction of outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the self-report-based but not the performance-based definition of frailty may represent an intermediate phenotype. A modified self-report definition can improve the accuracy of a questionnaire-based method of defining frailty.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
.
Of the 31 participants, 14 were frail and 17 non frail on the Reported Edmonton Frail Scale. The mean volume of distribution of gentamicin was 14.8 +/- 1.4 l in frail participants and 15.3 +/- 2.2 l in non frail (NS). Volume of distribution correlated best with lean bodyweight. Gentamicin clearance was significantly lower in frail participants (46.6 +/- 10.7 ml min-1) than in non frail (58.2 +/- 12.4 ml min-1, P = 0.01).
N2  - center dot Gentamicin pharmacokinetics show wide inter-individual
variability across all age groups and impaired gentamicin clearance is
associated with impaired creatinine clearance in older people.
center dot Changes in body composition and renal function with old age
and frailty are likely to affect the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin.
center dot There is current debate on whether the Modification of Diet
in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation estimate of glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) should replace the Cockcroft Gault equation estimate of creatinine
clearance for calculation of doses of renally excreted drugs.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
center dot The volume of distribution of gentamicin is not significantly
lower in frail than in non frail older people.
center dot The correlation between volume of distribution of gentamicin
and actual bodyweight is poor in frail and moderate in non frail older
people.
center dot Gentamicin clearance is significantly lower in frail than in
non frail older people.
center dot The Cockcroft Gault calculation of creatinine clearance,
calculated using ideal bodyweight, gave the best estimate of gentamicin
clearance in this population of frail and non frail older people.
center dot The MDRD estimate of GFR and Cockcroft Gault estimate of
creatinine clearance, calculated using actual bodyweight, overestimate
gentamicin clearance in frail and non frail older people.
AIMS
Frailty, a syndrome of decreased physiological reserve that is prevalent
in old age, impacts on clinical pharmacology. The aims of the study were
to (1) determine whether frailty affects the pharmacokinetics of
gentamicin and (2) assess the accuracy of different estimates of body
size and renal clearance as estimates of gentamicin pharmacokinetics in
older inpatients.
METHODS
This was an observational study of gentamicin pharmacokinetics in a
cohort of Australian hospital inpatients aged >= 65 years, who were
administered prophylactic intravenous gentamicin.
RESULTS
Of the 31 participants, 14 were frail and 17 non frail on the Reported
Edmonton Frail Scale. The mean volume of distribution of gentamicin was
14.8 +/- 1.4 l in frail participants and 15.3 +/- 2.2 l in non frail
(NS). Volume of distribution correlated best with lean bodyweight.
Gentamicin clearance was significantly lower in frail participants (46.6
+/- 10.7 ml min-1) than in non frail (58.2 +/- 12.4 ml min-1, P = 0.01).
The Cockcroft Gault estimate of creatinine clearance calculated using
ideal bodyweight gave the best estimate of gentamicin clearance (mean
error - 0.15 ml min-1, 95% CI -2.67, 2.39). The Cockcroft Gault
creatinine clearance calculated using actual bodyweight and the
estimated glomerular filtration rate from the modified diet in renal
disease equation overestimated gentamicin clearance, with mean errors of
-10.15 ml min-1 (95%CI -13.60, -6.71) and -18.86 ml min-1 (95% CI
-22.45, -15.27), respectively. The Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance
calculated using lean bodyweight underestimated gentamicin clearance
(mean error 6.54 ml min-1, 95% CI 4.18, 8.90).
CONCLUSIONS
Frail older people have significantly lower gentamicin clearance than
non frail. The best estimate of gentamicin clearance is obtained from
the Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance calculated using ideal
bodyweight.

N2  - The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation, Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease (CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent 'disease' and using age-specific cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis) and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the oldest old with CKD.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - Although the field of frailty research has expanded rapidly, it is still
a nascent concept within the clinical specialties. Frailty,
conceptualized as greater vulnerability to stressors because of
significant depletion of physiological reserves, predicts poorer
outcomes in several medical specialties, including cardiology, human
immunodeficiency virus care, and nephrology, and in the behavioral and
social sciences. Lack of a consensus definition, proliferation of
measurement tools, inadequate understanding of the biology of frailty,
and lack of validated clinical algorithms for frail individuals hinders
incorporation of frailty assessment and frailty research into the
specialties. In 2015, the American Geriatrics Society, the National
Institute on Aging (NIA), and the Alliance for Academic Internal
Medicine held a conference for awardees of the NIA-sponsored Grants for
Early Medical/ Surgical Specialists Transition into Aging Research
program to review the current state of knowledge regarding frailty in
the subspecialties and to highlight examples of integrating frailty
research into the medical specialties. Research questions to advance
frailty research into specialty medicine are proposed.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Iron overload, diagnosed by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is an increasingly recognized disorder in hemodialysis patients. Specific MRI protocols have been shown to provide a reliable estimation of tissue iron content in non-renal patient populations but have not been validated in dialysis patients. Such validation studies require liver biopsy for histological comparison, but this invasive and risky procedure raises ethical concerns, especially regarding frail patients with end-stage renal disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared in a pilot study Scheuer's histological classification and Deugnier and Turlin's histological classification of iron overload (Perls staining) with signal-intensity-ratio MRI values obtained with the Rennes University algorithm in 11 hemodialysis patients in whom liver biopsy was formally indicated for their medical follow-up. RESULTS: For Scheuer's histological classification, the Wilcoxon non-parametric matched-pairs test showed no significant difference in the ranking of iron overload by the two methods eg histology and MRI (sum of ranks = 1.5; p = 1). The MRI and Scheuer's histological classifications were tightly correlated (rho = 0.866, p = 0.0035, Spearman's coefficient), as were the absolute liver iron concentrations (LIC) at MRI (rho = 0.860, p = 0.0013, Spearman's coefficient). The absolute liver iron concentrations at MRI were also highly correlated with Deugnier and Turlin's histological scoring (rho = 0.841, p = 0.0033, Spearman's coefficient). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that liver iron determination based on signal-intensity-ratio MRI (Rennes University algorithm) very accurately identifies iron load in hemodialysis patients, by comparison with liver histology.

N2  - Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been advocated as a suitable substitution therapy in patients with failure of hemodialysis (HD) blood access, documentation of the performance of PD in such patients is limited. Here, we present an elderly patient with total failure of HD blood access who has had a remarkably successful course on PD. A 78-year-old man with several comorbidities started continuous ambulatory PD after a 3.5-year course of HD complicated by repeated vascular access infections and clotting episodes. These access complications resulted in 8 hospitalizations and led to inability to ambulate following a right femoral shaft fracture sustained in a fall secondary to confusion during an episode of access sepsis, and to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome following SVC thrombosis after internal jugular catheter insertion. Over approximately 3 years, PD has been very successful in this patient, with 2 early routine episodes of peritonitis and 1 early episode of exit-site infection, control of hematologic and biochemical values, no hospitalizations in the 2.5 years before the time of writing, and good quality of life. A dedicated spouse performing the PD tasks has been a major factor in the success of PD in this patient. Peritoneal dialysis can be successful as a renal replacement procedure in incapacitated elderly patients with failure of HD blood access. In these cases, the success of PD is enhanced by dedicated family members taking on PD tasks that the patient cannot perform.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

.

aged, hemodynamically frail patients, with several comorbidities and CKD, are at greater risk of MALA, despite MF dosage adjustment. 

N2  - Metformin (MF) accumulation during acute kidney injury is associated with high anion gap lactic acidosis type B (MF-associated lactic acidosis, MALA), a serious medical condition leading to high mortality. Despite dose adjustment for renal failure, diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III-IV are at risk for rapid decline in renal function by whatever reason, so that MF toxicity might arise if the drug is not timely withdrawn. Sixteen consecutive patients were admitted to our Hospital's Emergency Department with clinical findings consistent with MALA. Fifteen had prior history of CKD, 60 % of them with GFR between 30 and 60 ml/min. Of these, 5 required mechanical ventilation and cardiovascular support; 3 promptly recovered renal function after rehydration, whereas 10 (62 %) required continuous veno-venous renal replacement treatment. SOFA and SAPS II scores were significantly related to the degree of lactic acidosis. In addition, lactate levels were relevant to therapeutic choices, since they were higher in dialyzed patients than in those on conservative treatment (11.92 mmol/l vs 5.7 mmol/l, p = 0.03). The overall death rate has been 31 %, with poorer prognosis for worse acidemia, as serum pH was significantly lower in non-survivors (pH 6.96 vs 7.16, p > 0.04). Our own data and a review of the literature suggest that aged, hemodynamically frail patients, with several comorbidities and CKD, are at greater risk of MALA, despite MF dosage adjustment. Moreover, renal replacement therapy rather than simple acidosis correction by administration of alkali seems the treatment of choice, based on eventual renal recovery and overall outcome.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: We retrospectively assessed the initial clinical role of preoperative frailty in surgical patients with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD). METHODS: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients who underwent emergent or urgent surgical interventions for AAAD in our institute between April 2000 and March 2016 participated in this retrospective study. Patients with more than three of the following six modalities were defined as being frail: age older than 75 years, preoperative requirement of assistance in daily living, body mass index less than 18.5 kg/m(2), female, history of major stroke, and chronic kidney disease greater than class 3b. Twenty-three patients (20.2%) were diagnosed with frailty (group F), while 91 patients (79.8%) were not (group N). Early clinical outcomes, major postoperative complications, postoperative recovery of activity, and early or mid-term survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Although early clinical outcomes and the prevalence of major postoperative complications were similar in both groups, postoperative activity of daily living (ADL), such as the rate of being ambulatory on discharge (p < 0.05) and home discharge (p < 0.01), was significantly lower in group F than in group N. A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 1- and 5-year survival rates were similar in groups F (85.9 and 76.4%, respectively) and N (86.0 and 76.9%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative frailty in AAAD surgical patients has potential as a prognostic factor that affects delays in ADL recovery, but does not influence the early or mid-term clinical outcomes of prompt surgical strategies for life rescue in AAAD patients with frailty.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - The prevalence of chronic pain increases with age, although solid and
comparable epidemiological data addressing the oldest old and specific
settings are still sparse. Chronic pain is associated with
multimorbidity, disability and reduced quality of life. However, in many
cases it goes undetected, it is not adequately screened and assessed,
and treatment is suboptimal. Most drugs used for pain treatment carry a
higher risk of side effects in older subjects. This paper explores the
epidemiology, screening, diagnosis and management of chronic pain in old
age in three European countries. Chronic pain may go undiagnosed, as
screening programs for identification of this problem are yet uncommon,
both in community care and in hospitals and nursing homes. Pain
assessment is increasingly (but not universally) a part of comprehensive
geriatric assessment, and most geriatricians receive training and seem
to be confident in the diagnosis and management of chronic pain in
complex or frail patients. Primary care physicians are usually the first
providers to manage chronic pain, and only some patients are referred
for specialist care. Pain clinics are widely available in the three
countries, but older patients do not usually reach them. Acetaminophen
is the mainstay of treatment of chronic pain, with reducing - but yet
significant - use of NSAIDs and increasing use of weak opioids, mostly
tramadol. Strong opioids are not widely used in older subjects, and
concerns about side effects and on the choice of drugs in chronic renal
disease are still present. Non-pharmacological therapies are not
standardised. Attitudes towards chronic pain may hinder identification
and management of this highly prevalent geriatric problem. (C) 2013

N2  - Background: Environmental lead and cadmium exposure is associated with higher risk of several age-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis. These diseases may lead to frailty, a geriatric syndrome characterized by diminished physiologic reserve in multiple systems with decreased ability to cope with acute stressors. However, no previous study has evaluated the association between lead or cadmium exposure and frailty.; Methods: Cross-sectional study among individuals aged ≥ 60 years who participated in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and had either blood lead (N=5272) or urine cadmium (N=4887) determinations. Frailty was ascertained with a slight modification of the Fried criteria, so that individuals meeting ≥ 3 of 5 pre-defined criteria (exhaustion, low body weight, low physical activity, weakness and slow walking speed), were considered as frail. The association between lead and cadmium with frailty was evaluated using logistic regression with adjustment for relevant confounders.; Results: Median (intertertile range) concentrations of blood lead and urine cadmium were 3.9 µg/dl (2.9-4.9) and 0.62 µg/l (0.41-0.91), respectively. The prevalence of frailty was 7.1%. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of frailty comparing the second and third to the lowest tertile of blood lead were, respectively, 1.40 (0.96-2.04) and 1.75 (1.33-2.31). Lead concentrations were also associated with the frequency of exhaustion, weakness and slowness. The corresponding odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for cadmium were, respectively, 0.97 (0.68-1.39) and 1.55 (1.03-2.32), but this association did not hold after excluding participants with reduced glomerular filtration rate: 0.70 (0.43-1.14) and 1.09 (0.56-2.11), respectively.; Conclusions: In the US older adult population, blood lead but not urine cadmium concentrations showed a direct dose-response relationship with frailty. These findings support that lead exposure increases frailty in older adults.; Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Under normal conditions, inflammation is a protective and physiological response  to various harmful stimuli. However, in several chronic debilitating disorders, such as chronic kidney disease, inflammation becomes maladaptive, uncontrolled and persistent. Systemic persistent inflammation has, for almost 20 years, been recognized as a major contributor to the uraemic phenotype (such as cardiovascular disease, protein energy wasting, depression, osteoporosis and frailty), and a predictor of cardiovascular and total mortality. Since inflammation is mechanistically related to several ageing processes (inflammageing), it may be a major driver of a progeric phenotype in the uraemic milieu. Inflammation is likely the consequence of a multifactorial aetiology and interacts with a number of factors that emerge when uraemic toxins accumulate. Beside interventions aiming to decrease the production of inflammatory molecules in the uraemic milieu, novel strategies to increase the removal of large middle molecules, such as expanded haemodialysis, may be an opportunity to decrease the inflammatory allostatic load associated with retention of middle molecular weight uraemic toxins.

N2  - BACKGROUND: People's experiences of living with assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) have not been studied previously. Assisted PD is successfully used as renal replacement therapy for elderly and disabled patients with end-stage renal disease. To be treated with aPD implies being dependent on lifelong treatment at home. The aim of this study was to explore adults' experiences of living with aPD. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 participants with aPD, median age 82.5 years. The text was analyzed using a phenomenological-hermeneutical method. RESULTS: The participants experienced limitations and an uncertain future, but through different strategies and participation in healthcare, they could still enjoy what was important in life for them. The analysis of the text resulted in 4 main themes; 1) Facing new demands, 2) Managing daily life, 3) Partnership in care, and 4) Experiencing a meaningful life, leading to the comprehensive understanding: 'Striving for maintaining wellbeing'. CONCLUSION: The participants expressed that they experienced a good quality of life despite being physically frail, severely ill, and in need of home-based lifesaving treatment. The findings suggest that aPD should be available everywhere where PD is offered. Integrating the model of person-centered care may greatly improve the care for persons living with aPD.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To quantify the prevalence of frailty in adults of all ages undergoing chronic hemodialysis, its relationship to comorbidity and disability, and its association with adverse outcomes of mortality and hospitalization. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Single hemodialysis center in Baltimore, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-six individuals undergoing hemodialysis enrolled between January 2009 and March 2010 and followed through August 2012. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty, comorbidity, and disability on enrollment in the study and subsequent mortality and hospitalizations. RESULTS: At enrollment, 50.0% of older (>/= 65) and 35.4% of younger (<65) individuals undergoing hemodialysis were frail; 35.9% and 29.3%, respectively, were intermediately frail. Three-year mortality was 16.2% for nonfrail, 34.4% for intermediately frail, and 40.2% for frail participants. Intermediate frailty and frailty were associated with a 2.7 times (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-7.07, P = .046) and 2.6 times (95% CI = 1.04-6.49, P = .04) greater risk of death independent of age, sex, comorbidity, and disability. In the year after enrollment, median number of hospitalizations was 1 (interquartile range 0-3). The proportion with two or more hospitalizations was 28.2% for nonfrail, 25.5% for intermediately frail, and 42.6% for frail participants. Although intermediate frailty was not associated with number of hospitalizations (relative risk = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.49-1.16, P = .21), frailty was associated with 1.4 times (95% CI = 1.00-2.03, P = .049) more hospitalizations independent of age, sex, comorbidity, and disability. The association between frailty and mortality (interaction P = .64) and hospitalizations (P = .14) did not differ between older and younger participants. CONCLUSIONS: Adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis have a high prevalence of frailty, more than five times as high as community-dwelling older adults. In this population, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent predictor of mortality and number of hospitalizations.

N2  - AimA U-shaped relationship between body mass index (BMI) and all-cause
mortality has been reported, but there are few studies examining the
association between BMI and cause-specific mortality and
hospitalization. We carried out a longitudinal study to examine these
associations in Chinese older adults with multiple comorbidities, which
could provide a reference for the recommended BMI in this population.
MethodsFrom 2004 to 2013, a retrospective cohort of Chinese older adults
was selected from a geriatric day hospital in Hong Kong. They were
divided into groups according to their BMI: BMI <16; BMI 16-18; BMI
18.1-20; BMI 20.1-22; BMI 22.1-24; BMI 24.1-26; BMI 26.1-28; BMI 28.1-30
and BMI >30. Other assessments included medical, functional, cognitive,
social and nutritional assessment.
ResultsA total of 1747 older adults (mean age 80.87.1 years, 44.1%
male, 46.1% living in nursing homes, Charlson Comorbidity Index 2.0 +/-
1.6) with a median follow up of 3.5 years were included. Older adults
with BMI 24-28 had the lowest all-cause, infection-related and
cardiovascular mortality (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that
there was an inverted J-shaped association between BMI and hazard ratio
for all-cause and infection-related mortality in both nursing home and
community-dwelling older adults. The rate of all-cause hospitalization
was lower in older adults with BMI 22-28 (P=0.002). Multivariate
analysis showed that there was an inverted J-shaped association between
the odds ratio of recurrent hospitalization and BMI.
ConclusionChinese older adults with BMI 24-28 had lower all-cause
mortality, infection-related mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality
and all-cause hospitalization. This study provides a reference for the
recommended BMI in this population. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2015; 15 72-79.

N2  - In the case of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), physicians are facing more and more difficulties in managing VTE and their treatment in frail patients. These patients could present several risk situations such as: chronic kidney disease (CKD), underweight or malnourished, falls, cognitive impairment, multi-medicated patients, cancer and pregnancy. Guidelines typically recommend anticoagulation. There are multiple challenges in the safe use of anticoagulation in frail patients, including bleeding risk, monitoring and adherence, and polypharmacy. The objective of this review is to explore these at-risk situations and to suggest adequate anticoagulation therapy, when possible, in each of these complex situations.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of physical  activity on various aspects in Asian dialysis patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Study participants were recruited from 27 hospitals or dialysis centers in Korea (n = 1611). The participants were divided into 3 groups according to the degree of regular exercise: Inactive group, Intermediate group, and Active group. RESULTS: The proportions of patients with frailty and the presence of each component decreased as physical activity increased. The presence and numbers of disabilities decreased as physical activity increased. The number of participants with a history of fall during the last 12 months was 149 (20.5%) in the Inactive group, 88 (16.9%) in the Intermediate group, and 48 (13.2%) in the Active group. Physical component scale and mental component scale scores increased as physical activity increased. The survival rate for all-cause death at 500 days was 95.5% in the Active group, 95.2% in the Intermediate group, and 93.5% in the Inactive group. CONCLUSION: High physical activity was associated with favorable results for most health-related quality of life scale scores, including frailty, disability, and exhaustion, in Korean dialysis patients.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - During the last century the considerable increase in life expectancy has led to important demographic changes and, consequently, to new clinical scenarios. Nowadays, chronic conditions, comorbidities and socio-economic factors constitute a relevant health management issue. In particular, the definition of frail elderly individuals has proven to have a strong role in the identification of high-risk patients, their clinical management and prognosis. Reorganization of the medical system has been associated with the development of new instruments for clinical assessment, focused on clinical and socio-economic issues, resulting in a multidimensional geriatric assessment. A large number of approaches have been validated in different clinical settings and populations, until the development of multidimensional instruments demonstrated to have a crucial role in the identification of frail individuals and in their clinical management. Interestingly, some of these, such as the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), proved to play a relevant role in mortality risk stratification even in particular clinical settings such as chronic kidney disease.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) is now more available as an alternative to hospital haemodialysis (HD) for frail older patients but the lack of outcome data comparing HD with aPD has limited its use. FEPOD part 1 reported no significant difference in the primary outcomes of quality of life and physical functioning, except for higher prevalence of possible depression in the aPD group. This report describes the secondary outcomes for the study group. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Hospitalisation, falls, symptom burden, cognition and patient satisfaction. METHODS: aPD patients and HD patients were recruited from 11 centres. The HD patients were matched to recruited aPD participants by age, sex, diabetes status, time on dialysis, ethnicity and Index of Deprivation. The MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) and the Trail Making Form B were used to assess global cognitive function and executive function respectively. Falls and symptom burden were assessed using a falls questionnaire and the Palliative Outcome Symptom scale (renal) respectively. Patient satisfaction was measured using the Renal Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: 106 patients (52 HD; 54 aPD) were recruited. 35 % of the study group had at least one hospital admission in the preceding three months. 42% of all admissions were dialysis related. 28% of the study group had at least one fall in the preceding three months.83.3% of them occurred at home, with the HD group sustaining more fractures than the aPD group (26.7% HD vs. 6.7% aPD, p=0.329). Lethargy, pain and poor mobility were predominant in the study group. The median number of reported symptoms were 9 (IQR 7 – 11) in the HD group and 10 (IQR 7.75 to 13) in the aPD group.42.3% of HD patients reported no improvement in symptoms since starting dialysis, as against 25.9% of the aPD group. 10.5% of the study group had abnormal MMSE scores (<24). There was no statistical difference in MMSE scores between HD patients and aPD patients [mean MMSE – 27 (HD), 28 (aPD), p=0.120]. In contrast, 36.8% had executive dysfunction (trail making B test time > 300 seconds) .Executive dysfunction was more prevalent in the aPD group [54.2% aPD vs. 27.7% HD, (p = 0.089)]. Despite the above outcomes, 91.5% of the study group would recommend their therapy to others (mean total renal treatment satisfaction scores - 49.6 HD vs. 50.3 aPD, p=0.722). RELEVANCE: There is a high prevalence of falls, symptom burden, executive dysfunction and hospitalisation in frail elderly dialysis patients, irrespective of dialysis modality. This should be considered during discussions about renal replacement modalities (including non-dialytic care). FEPOD part 2, the longitudinal phase of the study, will provide information on the influence of dialysis modality on the trajectory of these outcomes.

N2  - Anemia is an important healthcare concern among the elderly. In these patients, the anemia is often mild, with a hemoglobin level >10 g/dL. It is usually well tolerated, but might be responsible for several proteiform and/or atypical presenting complaints. In the elderly, anemia is usually of multifactorial origin, including chronic inflammation, chronic kidney disease, nutrient deficiencies and iron deficiency (approximately two-thirds of all cases). The remaining cases are unexplained (unknown etiology). In the elderly, the classic diagnosis of anemia, which is based on the mean corpuscular volume associated with a low hemoglobin level, might not be accurate. A predefined standardized diagnostic procedure should be followed. In the common case of frail elderly patients, all investigations should be carefully considered and invasive examinations undertaken where justified (risk-benefit balance). Nevertheless, most cases of anemia require further investigation and the underlying cause should be identified and treated whenever possible.; © 2012 Japan Geriatrics Society.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes over the last decade has resulted in increasing numbers of frail older patients with a combination of these conditions. Current treatment guidelines may not necessarily be relevant for such patients, who are mostly excluded from the trials upon which these recommendations are based. There is a paucity of data upon which to base the management of older patients with CKD. Nearly all current guidelines recommend less-tight glycaemic control for the older population, citing the lack of proven medium-term benefits and concerns about the high short-term risk of hypoglycaemia. However, reports from large landmark trials have shown potential benefits for both microvascular and macrovascular complications, though the relevance of these findings to this specific population is uncertain. The trials have also highlighted potential alternative explanations for the hazards of intensive glycaemic control. These include depression, low endogenous insulin reserve, low body mass index and side effects of the medication. Over the last few years, newer classes of hypoglycaemic drugs with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia have emerged. This article aims to present a balanced view of advantages and disadvantages of intense glycaemic control in this group of patients, which we hope will help the clinician and patient to come to an individualized management approach.

N2  - Despite substantial improvements following the introduction of novel agents and antibodies, amyloid light-chain (AL)-amyloidosis still carries a grim prognosis. Here, we report on the case of a severely frail 86-year-old patient suffering from monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS)-associated AL-amyloidosis with a diuretic-refractory nephrotic syndrome. In this patient, treatment with bortezomib-dexamethasone effectively induced a serological response, but was unfortunately poorly tolerated and failed to promote renal recovery fast enough to prevent secondary complications. Facing ongoing nephrotic syndrome, we performed unilateral kidney embolization and observed a substantial improvement of hypoalbuminemia accompanied by a significant gain in overall quality of life despite the necessity for thrice weekly dialysis. It can be concluded that systemic drugs in MGRS typically do not lead to instantaneous organ recovery but may initially rather be associated with substantial treatment-related morbidity. In this setting, unilateral renal artery embolization is effective to treat nephrotic syndrome and its secondary complications. The risk of potentially adverse effects, including post-embolization syndrome, can be minimized by unilateral embolization, still noting that also one-sided renal ablation has to be balanced against the requirement for life-long renal replacement therapy. Prospective controlled trials in a more comprehensive cohort will be needed to estimate the overall benefit of kidney embolization relative to novel agent therapies in frail patients with MGRS-related AL-amyloidosis.

N2  - Structured follow-up after revascularisation for chronic critical limb
ischaemia (CLI) aims at sustained treatment success and continued best
patient care. Thereby, efforts need to address three fundamental
domains: (A) best medical therapy, both to protect the arterial
reconstruction locally and to reduce atherosclerotic burden
systemically; (B) surveillance of the arterial reconstruction; and (C)
timely initiation of repeat interventions. As most CLI patients are
elderly and frail, sustained resolution of CLI and preserved ambulatory
capacity may decide over independent living and overall prognosis.
Despite this importance, previous guidelines have largely ignored
follow-up after CLI; arguably because of a striking lack of evidence and
because of a widespread assumption that, in the context of CLI, efficacy
of initial revascularisation will determine prognosis during the short
remaining life expectancy. This chapter of the current CLI guidelines
aims to challenge this disposition and to recommend evidentially best
clinical practice by critically appraising available evidence in all of
the above domains, including antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy,
clinical surveillance, use of duplex ultrasound, and indications for and
preferred type of repeat interventions for failing and failed
reconstructions. However, as corresponding studies are rarely performed
among CLI patients specifically, evidence has to be consulted that
derives from expanded patient populations. Therefore, most
recommendations are based on extrapolations or subgroup analyses, which
leads to an almost systematic degradation of their strength.
Endovascular reconstruction and surgical bypass are considered
separately, as are specific contexts such as diabetes or renal failure;
and critical issues are highlighted throughout to inform future studies.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - In this paper, we propose a model for medical costs recorded at regular time intervals, e.g. every month, as repeated measures in the presence of a terminating event, such as death. Prior models have related monthly medical costs to time since entry, with extra costs at the final observations at the time of death. Our joint model for monthly medical costs and survival time incorporates two important new features. First, medical cost and survival may be correlated because more 'frail' patients tend to accumulate medical costs faster and die earlier. A joint random effects model is proposed to account for the correlation between medical costs and survival by a shared random effect. Second, monthly medical costs usually increase during the time period prior to death because of the intensive care for dying patients. We present a method for estimating the pattern of cost prior to death, which is applicable if the pattern can be characterized as an additive effect that is limited to a fixed time interval, say b units of time before death. This 'turn back time' method for censored observations censors cost data b units of time before the actual censoring time, while keeping the actual censoring time for the survival data. Time-dependent covariates can be included. Maximum likelihood estimation and inference are carried out through a Monte Carlo EM algorithm with a Metropolis-Hastings sampler in the E-step. An analysis of monthly outpatient EPO medical cost data for dialysis patients is presented to illustrate the proposed methods.

N2  - THE OPPORTUNITY BEDTIME PRESCRIBING MIGHT PROVIDE: Blood pressure normally exhibits a circadian rhythm with relatively lower pressures during sleep.(Ref 1) Lack of this sleep time "dip" correlates strongly with adverse cardiovascular events and BP correlates most strongly with such events when measured at night (i.e. during sleep).(Ref 2‐5) Motivated by such observations, Spanish researchers studied the effect of taking BP medication at BEDTIME (when the effect on nighttime BP would be greatest) versus conventional morning use, when most BP medications are taken. The results of this study (the MAPEC trial) were striking.(Ref 6) Over a median 5.6 years follow‐up, adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 187 of 1084 subjects taking BP medication in the morning but only 68 of 1072 subjects who took their BP medication at bedtime (relative risk 0.39, 95%CI [0.29‐0.51], p < 0.001). This 61% reduction in adverse events was similar for all individual components of the primary outcome (including death from all causes, stroke, MI, new angina pectoris, CHF and retinal artery occlusions). If true, a switch to bedtime prescribing would have more impact on the health of hypertensive patients than whether high BP is treated at all. However extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence ‐ independent replication of such surprising findings is needed for widespread practice change to occur. BEDMED: The BedMed trial is a pragmatic primary care trial intended to verify whether bedtime antihypertensive use, as compared to conventional morning use, reduces major adverse cardiovascular events. It is designed as an adaptive randomized registry trial within community primary care and draws both trial outcomes and baseline covariates from provincial administrative claims data (vital statistics, hospital separations, physician services, prescription dispenses, laboratory data). Covariates for the primary analysis will include age, sex, physical frailty (continuous, as determined by the Tilburg Frailty Indicator Physical Components sub‐score), cognitive impairment (continuous, as determined by the Short Blessed Test score), current smoking status, hospitalization in the 6 months prior to enrolment, ≥3 baseline BP meds (resistant hypertension), presence/absence of specific diagnoses (diabetes, CHF, stroke/TIA, coronary artery disease, sleep apnea), BMI > 30, ≥ 4 additional non‐BP lowering medications (polypharmacy), kidney disease (a claims data renal insufficiency diagnosis or eGFR less than 40), or end‐stage kidney disease on dialysis. Subgroup analysis based on the presence or absence of each of these covariates will be carried out (using an age threshold of ≥ 70 yrs, a Tilburg physical frailty threshold of ≥ 3, and a Short Blessed cognitive impairment threshold of ≥ 7). BedMed is government funded/facilitated, event driven (with the trial breaking upon 406 primary outcome events), will have over 300 volunteer primary care providers recruiting, is expected to enrol 8,750 consenting community patients with hypertension, and relies heavily on a collaboration between the volunteer family physicians of the Pragmatic Trials Collaborative (www.PragmaticTrials.ca) who will recruit for the trial and the Alberta SPOR Support Unit's Data Platform ‐ which will facilitate accessing and analyzing the relevant administrative databases (http://www.aihealthsolutions.ca/initiatives‐partnerships/spor/). DIURETIC SUB‐STUDY: The "adaptive" element of the BedMed trial design refers to an interim examination of bedtime diuretic tolerance. Although it is commonly believed that diuretics can't be taken at bedtime without inducing unwanted nocturia, the sparse evidence in the literature suggests this may not be the case.(Ref 7,8) Rather than excluding patients whose only medication is a diuretic the investigators will instead initially include such patients and evaluate bedtime diuretic tolerance early on in the trial to determine whether or not such patients should continue to be enrolled. Specifically, upon allocating to bedtime dosing 203 patients whose only BP medication is an AM diuretic (excluding diuretic / non‐diuretic combination pills) the investigators will analyze 6‐week compliance to bedtime allocation for all participants with a single morning BP medication (of all types). If diuretic compliance is worse, the "adaptive" trial design will exclude enrolment of additional patients whose only BP medication is a diuretic. The BedMed investigators will report on bedtime diuretic tolerance separate from (and in advance of) the main BedMed analysis. INTERIM SAFETY ANALYSIS: An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) organized and chaired by Jim Wright (Cochrane Hypertension Review Group Coordinating Editor) will review all data upon reaching 200 events (estimated to occur ~20 months in). If p is ≤ 0.001 for benefit (the Haybittle‐Peto boundary ‐ recommended to reduce the chance of stopping too early and magnifying benefit), or if p is ≤ 0.05 for harm, the DSMB will apply clinical judgement and make recommendations to the steering committee on whether the trial should break early.

After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality for the performance-based definition (2.16; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.41 to 3.29) was slightly higher than that of the self-reported function-based definition (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.00). Patients who met the self-report-based definition but not the physical performance definition of frailty (n=192) were not at statistically significantly higher risk of mortality than those who were not frail by either definition (n=330; HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.81 to 2.45), but those who met both definitions of frailty (n=204) were at significantly higher risk (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.51 to 4.01).
N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on dialysis and increases vulnerability to dependency and death. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We examined the predictive ability of frailty on the basis of physical performance and self-reported function in participants of a US Renal Data System special study that enrolled a convenience sample of 771 prevalent patients on hemodialysis from 14 facilities in the Atlanta and northern California areas from 2009 to 2011. Performance-based frailty was assessed using direct measures of grip strength (weakness) and gait speed along with weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity; poor self-reported function was substituted for weakness and slow gait speed in the self-reported function-based definition. For both definitions, patients meeting three or more criteria were considered frail. RESULTS: The mean age of 762 patients included in analyses was 57.1+/-14.2 years old; 240 patients (31%) met the physical performance-based definition of frailty, and 396 (52%) met the self-reported function-based definition. There were 106 deaths during 1.7 (interquartile range, 1.4-2.4) years of follow-up. After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality for the performance-based definition (2.16; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.41 to 3.29) was slightly higher than that of the self-reported function-based definition (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.00). Patients who met the self-report-based definition but not the physical performance definition of frailty (n=192) were not at statistically significantly higher risk of mortality than those who were not frail by either definition (n=330; HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.81 to 2.45), but those who met both definitions of frailty (n=204) were at significantly higher risk (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.51 to 4.01). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, defined using either direct tests of physical performance or self-reported physical function, was associated with higher mortality among patients receiving hemodialysis. Future studies are needed to determine the utility of assessing frailty in clinical practice.

N2  - BACKGROUND: With the Dutch population aging, the number of individuals 75 years old or more needing dialysis is growing. This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding nurse-assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) to the usual care pathway in frail Dutch end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. METHODS: THE CURRENT DUTCH TREATMENT PATHWAY (CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT, CM: 40% and PD in nursing home, nhPD: 60%) was compared in a decision-tree model with a new approach where the proportion of patients on dialysis would increase to 80% (i.e. CM: 20%; nhPD: 20%; and aPD: 60%). In-center hemodialysis was added in a secondary analysis. Inputs included survival (from literature), utility (from literature), and costs (2009 official tariffs). A healthcare payer's perspective was used with a 5-year horizon. RESULTS: The new approach was almost cost neutral in the primary analysis (despite more patients on dialysis) and dominant (more effective and less expensive) in the secondary analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was only euro52/QALY. In the sensitivity analyses (primary and secondary analyses), the new approach was either dominant or cost-effective in approximately 75% of the simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the investment required, offering aPD to frail elderly ESRD patients is a cost-effective alternative to the current pathway for Dutch healthcare payers.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during follow-up. RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change, 0.2 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity (0.6 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores (-1.1 points per g/dl; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition, patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction in frailty score (95% confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic rate was not independently associated with frailty. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores, with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.

N2  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid malignancy worldwide. Its incidence increases with age and about 40% of cases occur in patients over 70 years. Herein, we describe a case of a frail elderly patient with renal insufficiency and DLBCL treated with R-mini-CHOP. CASE REPORT: A 77-year-old man on maintenance hemodialysis started experiencing persistent fatigue. He was diagnosed with a large mass on the left lobe of the lung. Biopsy demonstrated a DLBCL, CD20 positive. The patient was assigned clinical stage IIBX, with a high age-adjusted international prognosis index. A proper geriatric assessment revealed a frail patient. Thus, an adapted chemotherapy regimen was proposed which consisted of R-mini-CHOP every 21 days, with a reduction of 10% in the doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. During the treatment, the patient went through regular dialysis sessions, 3 times per week, with an extra session performed 12 h after each chemotherapy administration. The patient experienced no adverse events or grade 3/4 toxicities. After 6 cycles of R-mini-CHOP, the patient achieved unconfirmed complete remission, and consolidation radiotherapy was performed. At the last follow-up, he was still in unconfirmed complete remission, with a progression-free survival of 11.3 months. CONCLUSIONS: R-mini-CHOP represented a reasonable treatment option for this patient with renal failure. The oncogeriatric approach led to a successful management of this frail patient, highlighting that an adapted plan of care is a key issue to improve the outcomes of elderly cancer patients.

N1  - Cause
N2  - Frailty is characterized by a decline in physiological reserves and is manifested by losses of body weight, muscle mass, strength, and energy. It is common in the elderly, and more prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), even in those at younger ages. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of frailty in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis and the possible factors common to both syndromes, for example, endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory markers, metabolic acidosis, anemia, and low level of vitamin D. We also aimed to develop a less subjective method of assessment of frailty and compare its performance with another used in patients with CKD, regarding to negative outcomes after one year of follow-up. In this study, we evaluated cross-sectionally 61 adult patients of both sexes with CKD stages 3 to 5 not yet in dialysis. The diagnosis of CKD was based on the criteria proposed by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQITM). The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated from serum creatinine using the MDRD formula. The diagnosis of frailty was based as proposed by Johansen et al. (2007), measuring slowness/weakness (SF-36), poor endurance/ exhaustion (SF-36), physical inactivity, and unintentional weight loss. A total of 5 points was possible, with 2 points for weakness and slowness and 1 point for each of the other criteria. Patients scoring ≥3 were defined as frail. Our instrument differed from Johansen’s since we use handgrip for assessment of weakness and 6 minutes walking test to assess physical inactivity. The patients were divided in not frail (NF) and frail (F). Besides the lab tests, the other variables assessed were C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), endothelial function (assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilatation), bone density (DXA), vitamin D (HPLC). The mean age of the 61 patients included in this study was 60,5±11,5 years old, 41 % were female, and 43,9% were white. There was no statistical difference between the main causes of CKD in frail and not frail patients: hypertension (26.9% vs. 31.4%), diabetes mellitus (11.4% vs. 18.0%), and glomerulonephritis (20.0% vs. 14.8%). The median (interquartil interval) serum creatinine was 2,3 (1,7-3,5) mg/dL, the GFR was 23 (16-39) mL/min/1.73 m2. The frailty syndrome was diagnosed in 42.6% of the patients. Although the frail patients were older (p= 0.0009), 30.8% were younger than 60 years. The frailty patients were more likely to be women (p= 0.02), had higher fat mass (p= 0.05), more osteoporosis (p= 0.01), higher PTH (p= 0.02), lower transferrin saturation ratio (p= 0.02) and more endothelial dysfunction (p= 0.05). The construct of frailty correlated positively with age (r= 0,25, p= 0.05), fat mass (r= 0.25, p= 0.04) and PTH (r= 0.30, p= 0.01), and negatively with endothelial dysfunction (r= -0.367, p= 0.004). In the regression analysis, female sex (OR: 11,3; IC 95% 2,3 - 55,6), age >60 years (OR: 4,0; IC 95% 1,0 – 16,2), obesity (OR: 6,6; IC 95% 1,1 – 36,7), and endothelial dysfunction (OR: 3,8; IC 95% 1,0 – 14,8) correlated with the frail phenotype. There was a 67% agreement of both criteria in identifying frail patients. However, when comparing both instruments of assessment of frailty, ours correlated better with negative outcomes. Frailty is frequent and early in CKD patients not yet in dialysis, and associates with negative outcomes. Bone mineral disorders, endothelial dysfunction seems to be potential mechanisms underlying the CKD and frailty.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Objectives The clinical condition of frailty is a common problem in the elderly population. However, the relationship between peripheral artery disease and frailty in hemodialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the relationships between peripheral artery disease and frailty in Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods A total of 362 chronic hemodialysis patients who regularly visited six institutions were enrolled. To evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty phenotype adjusted for Japanese were used. Peripheral artery disease was defined as ankle-brachial index <0.9. Results Of 362 patients, 62 patients (17.1%) were categorized as peripheral artery disease group and 300 patients (82.9%) as Non-peripheral artery disease group. The prevalence of frailty in the peripheral artery disease group was significantly higher than in the Non-peripheral artery disease group (34% vs. 18%, P = 0.0103). Non-shunt side grip strength was significantly stronger in the Non-peripheral artery disease group (23.6 kg vs. 17.0 kg, P < 0.0001). Thigh circumferences were also significantly larger in the Non-peripheral artery disease group (41.7 cm vs. 39.7 cm, P = 0.0054). A multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the factors independently associated with peripheral artery disease were as follows: frailty (odds ratio = 2.06, 95% confidence interval 1.09-3.89) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 3.74, 95% confidence interval 2.05-6.83). Conclusions It is concluded that peripheral artery disease is closely associated with frailty in hemodialysis patients.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - This paper charts the development of haemodialysis, the cornerstone of renal replacement therapy (RRT). It has enabled patients with end-stage renal failure to survive for years, in many cases with a surprisingly good quality of life. Through technological advances, RRT can be offered to patients who are older and more frail. Many have intercurrent comorbid illness. Such patients can have good quality of life, but their survival is shorter since they are likely to succumb early to comorbid illnesses. The challenge to nephrologists is to provide treatment based on exacting standards for all those patients who can benefit, yet to maintain cost-effectiveness. There is increasing recognition that, however good the technology underpinning dialysis, what justifies the cost and commitment that dialysis entails is the provision for the patient of a satisfactory quality of life.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The aging of the US population, and Western society populations in general, has been of concern to demographers and health planners for a number of years. The implications of this demographic shift include both increased economic and health care burdens for the United States. The growth of the end-stage renal disease population in the 1980s and 1990s suggested massive increases in this very expensive and frail population. However, recent incidence rates suggest that future growth may not be as great as thought just a few years ago.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with
increased postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with
peripheral artery disease who underwent lower extremity surgical
revascularization; however, outcomes after peripheral vascular
intervention (PVI) are less well established. This study sought to
determine the impact of CKD on adverse outcomes in patients with
peripheral artery disease who underwent PVI. Using data from the Veteran
Affairs Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System Program, we
identified a cohort of 755 patients who underwent lower extremity PVI
from June 2005 to August 2010 at 33 sites. The outcomes of interest were
mortality, progression to dialysis, myocardial infarction, limb
amputation, and stroke. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox
proportional hazard frailty models assessed the association between CKD
and adverse outcomes. Of the patients who underwent lower extremity PVI,
201 patients (27%) had CKD. The presence of CKD was associated with
decreased survival (5-year survival probability of CKD compared with
non-CKD: 49.9% {[}41.6% to 59.9%] vs 80.1% {[}76.2% to 84.1]),
which persisted after risk adjustment (BR 1.57; 95% confidence interval
1.13 to 2.19). In addition, there was a significant association between
CKD and progression to dialysis (HR 6.62; 95% confidence interval 2.25
to 19.43). In contrast, there was no association between CKD and
re-hospitalization for myocardial infarction, limb amputation, or
stroke. In conclusion, CKD is present in 1 of 4 patients who underwent
PVI and is associated with increased risk of mortality and progression
to dialysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Renal function declines with age, but little is known about the extent of renal insufficiency among the institutionalized elderly. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a large sample of elderly adults living in long-term care facilities, and to compare two commonly used methods for estimating GFR. METHODS: A total of 9931 residents aged 65 years and older participated in a retrospective cross-sectional study of 87 long-term care facilities in Ontario. GFR was estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) equations. The prevalence of low GFR, using the Cockcroft-Gault equation (<30 mL/min), was compared with the MDRD equation (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2). RESULTS: A total of 17.0% (95% CI 15.6 to 18.5) of men and 14.4% (95% CI 13.6 to 15.3) of women had a serum creatinine concentration above the laboratory reported upper reference limit of normal. The prevalence of both elevated serum creatinine and low GFR were observed to increase with age (P < 0.0001). The Cockcroft-Gault equation produced a consistently lower estimate of GFR than did the MDRD equation, a discrepancy most pronounced in the oldest residents. Among all men, a low GFR was more prevalent using the Cockcroft-Gault (10.3%, 95% CI 9.2 to 11.5) than MDRD (3.5%, 95% CI 2.8 to 4.2) equation, with a similar difference also seen in women (23.3%, 95% CI 22.4 to 24.3 versus 4.0%, 95% CI 3.6 to 4.5, respectively). Of all residents whose Cockcroft-Gault estimated GFR was under 30 mL/min, 14.7% (95% CI 13.2 to 16.3) were found to have GFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 according to the MDRD equation. CONCLUSION: Age-associated renal impairment is common among elderly long-term care residents, but there exists a clear discrepancy between the Cockcroft-Gault and MDRD equations in predicting GFR. Consideration should be given to medication dose adjustment, based on a practical estimate of GFR. However clarification is needed about which method, if either, is most valid among the frail elderly. Complex patient and societal issues surrounding advanced care directives, treatments associated with renal insufficiency, and, if and when to initiate dialysis, require further attention.

N2  - Objectives To derive and validate a risk prediction equation to estimate the short term risk of death, and to develop a classification method for frailty based on risk of death and risk of unplanned hospital admission.Design Prospective open cohort study.Participants Routinely collected data from 1436 general practices contributing data to QResearch in England between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used to develop the scores and a separate set of 357 practices to validate the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 65-100 years were in the derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the validation cohort.Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort were used to derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation of the risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group. The new mortality equation was used in conjunction with the existing QAdmissions equation (which predicts risk of unplanned hospital admission) to classify patients into frailty groups.Main outcome measure The primary outcome was all cause mortality.Results During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the derivation cohort arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The final model included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic group, smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the past 12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive heart failure, corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, learning disability, leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, poor mobility, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result, high platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite loss, unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the equation explained 55.6% of the variation in time to death (R(2)), and had very good discrimination-the D statistic was 2.29, and Harrell's C statistic value was 0.85. The corresponding values for men were 53.1%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining predicted risks of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7% of patients (n=13 665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4% (n=46 770) as moderately frail, 43.1% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8% (n=223 790) as fit.Conclusions We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of death in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social, and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction with the QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty groups (known as QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be identified for further assessment or interventions.

N2  - In this consensus paper, the Belgian Bone Club aims to provide a state of the art on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of osteoporosis in frail individuals, including patients with anorexia nervosa, patients on dialysis, cancer patients, persons with sarcopenia, and the oldest old. All these conditions may indeed induce bone loss that is superimposed on physiological bone loss and often remains under-recognized and under-treated. This is of particular concern because of the major burden of osteoporotic fractures in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic cost. Therefore, there is an urgent need to appreciate bone loss associated with these conditions, as this may improve diagnosis and management of bone loss and fracture risk in clinical practice.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) elderly patients have a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to the combination of ageing and chronic nephropathy damage. This situation is very important to be taken into account in order to prescribe an adequate medication and dialysis dose in this aged group. Besides, cognitive and urinary incontinence problems make difficult to obtain an adequate 24-h urine collection in order to evaluate creatinine clearance in this group. Thus, a reliable GFR estimating equation would be very useful for assisting elderly CKD patients. Additionally, Kt/V is the main parameter currently used for dosing dialysis in stage V CKD young and elderly patients. However, frailty and sarcopenia are prevalent disorders usually suffered by old people, who also present many physiological changes that could make GFR estimating equations and standard Kt/V value to become unreliable in this particular group. In conclusion, based on all these facts, it seems crucial for clinical geriatric nephrology to carefully evaluate how reliable current GFR estimating equations are, as well as which would be an adequate Kt/V value in CKD frail elderly patients.

N2  - As people live longer, chronic illness care will consume an ever-larger part of a nation's financial resources. With the 'baby-boomer' generation reaching retirement age beginning in 2011, there will be an increased demand for chronic services/care in the population aged 65 years and older. Innovative approaches to quality care must be sought, while understanding the financial costs associated with the delivery of such care to the geriatric population. Elderly persons utilize more physical resources and it is important to identify early those beneficiaries who would benefit medically from intervention. Disease management is built on a model of integrated care, with each member of the healthcare team working together toward a common set of objectives. The ultimate goal is to keep the patient functioning well in an outpatient setting, thus avoiding the high debility and costs associated with hospitalization and institutionalization. Creating such a system requires a substantial investment in infrastructure. The concept of 'spending $5.00 to save $10.00' must be incorporated into the planning process. In chronically ill seniors there is a need for care as well as cure, which involves improving function and quality of life (QOL) for the frail elders by paying attention to the psychological and socioeconomic status in addition to the physical condition. Small gains in function can mean large gains in patients' QOL. Reducing the progression of functional decline among the physically frail who live at home is a goal. Home visits are a critical component of the total care delivered. Changing physician behavior to accept the tenets of disease management requires education in advance of launching such a program. There must be healthcare team buy-in for a program to achieve success. Personnel requirements include senior nurses, social workers, physical therapists and nutritionists, supported by a sophisticated information technology system. Components of an information technology system must allow for adequate data collection and subsequent generation of reports. Continuous quality improvement will occur only if such a system is in place. While the average chronologic age of the patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is almost 62 years, the physiologic age is much older. Therefore, ESRD serves as a model for chronic illness that affects a geriatric population and the benefits achieved by a disease management approach to this chronic disease are noted. Disease management improved glycemic control in the ESRD patient with diabetes mellitus by establishing a protocol for frequency of measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c). For this population at risk, a decreased hospitalization rate for diabetic complications resulted from this initiative. Also, a vascular access initiative in the described ESRD disease management program resulted in an increase in the creation of arterio-venous fistulas and a decrease in the placement of tunneled-cuff catheters. Fistula creation was associated with less infections and access thrombosis compared with catheter use for access. QOL improved for these patients with ESRD because of decreased hospitalization rate for access-related issues. Significant cost savings were achieved because of fewer hospital admissions and a decrease in the number of bed days per year. The lessons learned from the ESRD model can help in developing future disease management programs for the geriatric population.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In frail elderly patients, the chronic use of renal replacement therapy sometimes affords no tangible benefits and may even negatively affect their quality of life (Qol), making prolonged conservative management a reasonable option. METHODS: This observational, uncontrolled study was conducted on 11 end-stage renal disease patients over 75 years of age, on prolonged conservative treatment with a follow-up of at least 6 months, to assess compliance with the Italian clinical guidelines concerning the treatment of renal failure, comorbidities, hospital stays, and several psychometric and Qol indicators in the patients and their caregivers. RESULTS: We found a substantial compliance with the targets recommended in the guidelines, a moderate tendency for disease progression and satisfactory psychometric and Qol parameters, which proved much the same as those observed in a parallel (uncontrolled) group of patients on haemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that a conservative strategy is feasible for frail uraemic patients, achieving acceptable clinical results and a Qol comparable with patients on haemodialysis. The study also provides indications on how to plan trials on this topic, to obtain the evidence needed to guide the difficult choice of whether to recommend dialysis or conservative treatment for such frail patients.

physical and mental quality of life.
N2  - Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.

Methods

Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.

Results

Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower physical and mental quality of life.

Conclusions

Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients’ quality of life.

N2  - The dialysis community has increasingly shown the health benefits of short daily hemodialysis (sDHD) at home. While this appears mainly suitable for younger and more independent patients, it seems likely that older and frailer patients would benefit from short daily dialysis as well. Humber River Regional Hospital has an in-center daily dialysis program in Canada, offering services to 31 patients. The experiences of patients, challenges for the health care team, and funding issues are discussed and point toward a promising future for in-center daily dialysis. However, a need for studies of greater quality and quantity is outlined as a major obstacle in gaining widespread support for in-center daily dialysis from the funders of dialysis care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patient-centered quality outcomes such as disposition after surgery are increasingly being scrutinized. Preoperative factors predictive of nonhome discharge (DC) may identify at-risk patients for targeted interventions. This study examines the association among preoperative risk factors, frailty, and nonhome DC after elective vascular surgery procedures in patients living at home. METHODS: The 2011-2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was queried to identify all home-dwelling patients who underwent elective vascular procedures (endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair, suprainguinal and infrainguinal bypasses, peripheral endovascular interventions, carotid endarterectomy, and stent). Preoperative frailty was measured using the modified frailty index (mFI; derived from Canadian Study of Health and Aging). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association of frailty and nonhome DC. RESULTS: Of 15,843 home-dwelling patients, 1,177 patients (7.4%) did not return home postoperatively. Frailty (mFI > 0.25) conferred a significantly increased 2-fold risk of nonhome DC disposition for each procedure type. Frailty, female gender, open procedures, increasing age, end-stage renal disease, and occurrence of any postoperative complication were associated with increased risk of nonhome DC. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, frailty increased the odds of nonhome DC by 60% (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4-1.8) after adjusting for other covariates. In the presence of complications, the risk of nonhome DC was 27.5% in frail versus 16.5% in nonfrail patients (P < 0.001). In the absence of complications, although absolute risk was lower, frail patients were nearly twice as likely to not return home (frail 5.5% vs. nonfrail 2.75%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frail home-dwelling patients undergoing elective vascular procedures are at high risk of not returning home after surgery. Preoperative frailty assessment appears to hold potential for counseling regarding postsurgery disposition and DC planning.

N2  - ObjectivesTo compare the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin, a sodium
glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor developed to treat type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM), in individuals younger than 75 and those aged 75 and
older.
DesignRandomized Phase 3 studies.
SettingInternational study centers.
ParticipantsAdults with T2DM.
MeasurementsChanges from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)),
fasting plasma glucose (FPG), blood pressure (BP), and body weight were
measured. Efficacy was evaluated using pooled data from six randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (N=4,158; n=3,975 aged <75,
n=183 aged 75). Safety was assessed based on adverse event (AE) reports
from eight randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled
studies (N=9,439; n=8,949 aged <75, n=490 aged 75).
ResultsCanagliflozin 100 and 300mg were associated with
placebo-subtracted mean reductions in HbA(1c) in participants younger
than 75 (-0.69% and -0.85%, respectively) and aged 75 and older
(-0.65% and -0.55%, respectively). Dose-related reductions in FPG,
body weight, and BP were seen with canagliflozin 100 and 300mg in
participants in both age groups. Overall AE incidence was 67.1% with
canagliflozin 100mg, 68.6% with canagliflozin 300mg, and 65.9% with
non-canagliflozin (pooled group of comparators in all studies) in
participants younger than 75, and 72.4%, 79.1%, and 72.3%,
respectively, in those aged 75 and older, with a similar safety profile
in both groups. The incidence of volume depletion-related AEs was 2.2%,
3.1%, and 1.4% in participants younger than 75 with canagliflozin 100
and 300mg and non-canagliflozin, respectively, and 4.9%, 8.7%, and
2.6%, respectively, in those aged 75 and older.
ConclusionCanagliflozin improved glycemic control, body weight, and BP
in participants aged 75 and older. The overall incidence of AEs was high
across treatment groups in participants aged 75 and older and higher
than in those younger than 75. The safety profile of canagliflozin was
generally similar in both age groups, with a higher incidence of AEs
related to volume depletion observed with canagliflozin in participants
aged 75 and older than in those younger than 75. These findings support
canagliflozin, starting with the 100-mg dose, as an effective
therapeutic option for older adults with T2DM.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many different populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its multitude of complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly higher risk for cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual. However, it is clear now that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of the complications but also prevent them. Therefore, various important public health organizations all over the world have turned their focus and attention to CKD and its risk factors, early detection and early intervention. Nevertheless, the general goals in preventing the increase in CKD and its complications are far from being completely achieved. Why is this so? What is the magnitude and complexity of the problem? How is it affecting the population - are there differences in its affection by age, gender or frail elderly versus the robust? Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and aggressively? Are there subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on dialysis versus the non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of CKD aggressively, will it make a difference in the disease progression, its complications or to quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly succumb to? What do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire dialysis or transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for those who refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly with CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist? The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality of life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other vital aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day practice by each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the elderly with men being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively the vital aspects of CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical standpoint.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A geriatric assessment is an appropriate method for identifying frail elderly patients. In CKD, it may contribute to optimize personalized care. However, a geriatric assessment is time consuming. The purpose of our study was to compare easy to apply frailty screening tools with the geriatric assessment in patients eligible for dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 123 patients on incident dialysis >/=65 years old were included <3 weeks before to </=2 weeks after dialysis initiation, and all underwent a geriatric assessment. Patients with impairment in two or more geriatric domains on the geriatric assessment were considered frail. The diagnostic abilities of six frailty screening tools were compared with the geriatric assessment: the Fried Frailty Index, the Groningen Frailty Indicator, Geriatric8, the Identification of Seniors at Risk, the Hospital Safety Program, and the clinical judgment of the nephrologist. Outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. RESULTS: In total, 75% of patients were frail according to the geriatric assessment. Sensitivity of frailty screening tools ranged from 48% (Fried Frailty Index) to 88% (Geriatric8). The discriminating features of the clinical judgment were comparable with the other screening tools. The Identification of Seniors at Risk screening tool had the best discriminating abilities, with a sensitivity of 74%, a specificity of 80%, a positive predictive value of 91%, and a negative predictive value of 52%. The negative predictive value was poor for all tools, which means that almost one half of the patients screened as fit (nonfrail) had two or more geriatric impairments on the geriatric assessment. CONCLUSIONS: All frailty screening tools are able to detect geriatric impairment in elderly patients eligible for dialysis. However, all applied screening tools, including the judgment of the nephrologist, lack the discriminating abilities to adequately rule out frailty compared with a geriatric assessment.

N2  - Peritoneal dialysis is troubled with declining utilisation as a form of renal replacement therapy in developed countries. We review key aspects of therapy evidenced to have a potential to increase its utilisation. The best evidence to repopulate PD programmes is provided for the positive impact of timely referral and systematic and motivational predialysis education: average odds ratio for instituting peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis was 2.6 across several retrospective studies on the impact of predialysis education. Utilisation of PD for unplanned acute dialysis starts facilitated by implantation of peritoneal catheters by interventional nephrologists may diminish the vast predominance of haemodialysis done by central venous catheters for unplanned dialysis start. Assisted peritoneal dialysis can improve accessibility of home based dialysis to elderly, frail, and dependant patients, whose quality of life on replacement therapy may benefit most from dialysis performed at home. Peritoneal dialysis providers should perform close monitoring, preventing measures, and timely prophylactic therapy in patients judged to be prone to EPS development. Each peritoneal dialysis programme should regularly monitor, report, and act on key quality indicators to manifest its ability of constant quality improvement and elevate the confidence of interested patients and financing bodies in the programme.

N2  - We performed a large genome-wide association study to discover genetic
variation associated with muscular strength, and to evaluate shared
genetic aetiology with and causal effects of muscular strength on
several health indicators. In our discovery analysis of 223,315
individuals, we identified 101 loci associated with grip strength (P <5
x 10(-8)). Of these, 64 were associated (P < 0.01 and consistent
direction) also in the replication dataset (N=111,610). eQTL analyses
highlighted several genes known to play a role in neuro-developmental
disorders or brain function, and the results from meta-analysis showed a
significant enrichment of gene expression of brain-related transcripts.
Further, we observed inverse genetic correlations of grip strength with
cardiometabolic traits, and positive correlation with parents' age of
death and education. We also showed that grip strength had shared
biological pathways with indicators of frailty, including cognitive
performance scores. By use of Mendelian randomization, we provide
evidence that higher grip strength is protective of both coronary heart
disease (OR= 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.79, P < 0.0001) and atrial
fibrillation (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90, P = 0.003). In conclusion,
our results show shared genetic aetiology between grip strength, and
cardiometabolic and cognitive health; and suggest that maintaining
muscular strength could prevent future cardiovascular events.

N2  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent
chronic condition with a dramatic impact on the health status that is
evident even in milder stages of the disease. However, deaths due to
respiratory causes account for only a fraction of mortality in COPD.
Thus, comorbid conditions as potential co-determinants of the effects of
COPD on both health status and survival have received much attention in
the last years. COPD is almost invariably associated with other
diseases, and three mechanisms most likely underpin this association.
First, COPD is an age-related diseases, and as such tend to be
associated with other age-related diseases. Second, COPD shares its most
important risk factor-cigarette smoking-with several other diseases, in
particular cardiovascular diseases. Third, COPD, or COPD treatment, may
impact other systems or organs, as is the case of COPD-associated anemia
or osteoporosis. The aim of this article is to provide an overview on
the comorbidities of COPD that are most relevant for the elderly,
providing information relevant for patients' management. COPD is a
highly prevalent chronic condition, the only one whose prevalence is
steadily rising in western countries (1). Currently the sixth, it is
expected to rank the third cause of death by 2020 (2). Furthermore, it
dramatically impacts the health status and the personal independence
(3). However, deaths due to respiratory causes account for only a
fraction of mortality in COPD (4), whereas health status is frequently
impaired even in the milder stages of the disease (5). This fact has
switched the attention to comorbid conditions as potential
co-determinants of the effects of COPD on both health status and
survival.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients reaching end-stage kidney disease face difficult decisions, including choosing among renal replacement therapies (RRTs). With an increasingly elderly and frail population, there is growing interest in conservative kidney management (CKM) as a viable alternative to dialysis. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a patient-centered approach to these decisions, in which choices are viewed within the explicitly discussed values and preferences of the patient. Patient decision aids (PDAs) are tools designed to facilitate these discussions. The choice between dialysis and CKM is particularly complex, given the poor prognostication data for CKM. This is an emerging area for PDAs in nephrology. This review highlights care gaps around SDM for dialysis versus CKM, presents current PDAs for making choices about RRTs and CKM and discusses exciting new work around the development of novel PDAs. RECENT FINDINGS: Many PDAs have been created recently, primarily to help with decisions about RRTs. Three new PDAs are in testing phases to aid with the more complex decision of choosing between dialysis and CKM. SUMMARY: International nephrology communities are moving toward improved SDM with their patients and PDAs are being developed to facilitate this process.

N2  - Introduction: The number of elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD) has increased in recent years, and the best therapeutic approach has not been determined due to a lack of evidence.; Objectives: To observe the progression of elderly patients with ACKD (stages 4 and 5) and to compare the survival of stage 5 CKD patients with and without dialysis treatment.; Material and Methods: All patients ≥70 years who began ACKD follow-up from 01/01/2007 to 31/12/2008 were included, and their progression was observed until 31/12/2013. Demographic data, the Charlson comorbidity index, history of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) were assessed.; Results: A total of 314 patients ≥70 years with stages 4 and 5 CKD were studied. Of these patients, 162 patients had stage 5 CKD at the beginning of follow-up or progressed to stage 5 during the study, and 69 of these patients were treated with dialysis. In the stage 5 group: median age was 77 years (74-81); 48% had IHD; 50% had DM, Charlson 7 (6-9). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis: ≥70 years (93 vs. 69 patients with dialysis, log rank: 15 P<.001); patients ≥75 years (74 vs. 46 patients with dialysis, log rank: 8.9 P=.003); patients ≥80 (40 vs. 15 patients with dialysis) and p=0,2. Patients receiving dialysis were younger, with a lower Charlson comorbidity index and shorter follow-up time.; Conclusions: Our study shows that dialysis treatment improves survival, although this benefit is lost in patients ≥80 years.; Copyright © 2016 Sociedad Española de Nefrología.

N2  - Background: Given the volume and cost of inpatient care during the last year of life, there is a critical need to identify patterns of dying as a means of planning end-of-life care services, especially for the growing number of older persons who receive services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Methods: A retrospective computerized record review was conducted of 20,933 VHA patients who died as inpatients between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002. Diagnoses were aggregated into one of five classification patterns of death and analyzed in terms of health care resource utilization (mean number of inpatient days and cumulative outpatient visits in the year preceding the patient's death). Results: Cancer deaths were the most common (30.4%) followed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (23.2%), cardiopulmonary failure (21.4%), frailty (11.6%), 'other' diagnoses (7.3%), and sudden deaths (6.1%). Those with ESRD were more likely to be male and nonwhite (p < 0.05) and those with frailty were more likely to be older and married (p < 0.05). Controlling for demographic variables, those with frailty had the highest number of inpatient days while those with ESRD had the highest number of outpatient visits. Nonmarried status was associated with more inpatient days, especially among younger decedents. Conclusion: As a recognized leader in end-of-life care, the VHA can play a unique role in the development of specific interventions that address the diverse needs of persons with different dying trajectories identified through this research.

N2  - PURPOSE: Prognosis of the increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is poor with high risk of functional decline and mortality. Frailty seems to be a good predictor for those patients that will not benefit from dialysis. Varying prevalences between populations are probably related to the instrument used. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of frailty among ESRD patients with two different validated instruments. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients, aged >/=18 years, receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis care between September 2013 and December 2013 in a single dialysis center in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. Frailty was measured with the frailty index (FI) and frailty phenotype (FP). RESULTS: Prevalence of frailty by the FI was 36.8 % among 95 participants with ESRD (age: 65.2 years, SD +/- 12.0). Frailty prevalence among participants aged >/=65 and <65 years was 43.6 and 27.5 %, respectively. Female sex [odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.3-8.0] and a Charlson comorbidity index score of >/=5 (OR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.0-6.6) were associated with frailty. The FI identified different but overlapping participants as frail compared with the FP; 62.5 % of frail participants according to FI were also frail according to the FP. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of frailty among young and elderly ESRD patients is high; being female and having more comorbidity was associated with frailty. Use of a broader definition of frailty, like the FI, gives a higher estimation of prevalence among ESRD patients compared with a physical frailty assessment.

Cox proportional hazards modeling indicated that frailty was independently associated with higher risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.60–3.15) and with the combined outcome of death or hospitalization (adjusted HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.41–1.87).
N2  - The construct of frailty has been associated with adverse outcomes among elderly individuals, but the prevalence and significance of frailty among patients with end-stage renal disease have not been established. The aim of the current study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of frailty among a cohort of incident dialysis patients and to determine the degree to which frailty was associated with death and hospitalization. We studied a cohort of 2275 adults who participated in the Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Wave 2 study, of whom two-thirds met our definition of frailty: a composite construct that incorporated poor self-reported physical functioning, exhaustion/fatigue, low physical activity, and undernutrition. Multivariable logistic regression analysis suggested that older age, female sex, and hemodialysis (rather than peritoneal dialysis) were independently associated with frailty. Cox proportional hazards modeling indicated that frailty was independently associated with higher risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.60–3.15) and with the combined outcome of death or hospitalization (adjusted HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.41–1.87). Frailty is extremely common and is associated with adverse outcomes among incident dialysis patients. Given its prevalence and consequences, increased research efforts should focus on interventions aimed to prevent or attenuate frailty in the dialysis population.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Management of chronic uremia in elderly patients presents several clinic and organizational difficulties. Hemodialysis (HD) and chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) are both available for the elderly, and the choice depends on the individual, clinical and familial conditions. Several reports have compared the outcomes for older patients treated by HD or peritoneal dialysis, with those for younger or older patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. CPD is a successful dialysis option for elderly patients, in both patient and technique survival terms. All nutritional parameters are of pivotal importance. Several barriers, such as medical and social factors, physician bias, late referral and education irrespective of the needs of older patients, influence the choice of CPD. The development of assisted peritoneal dialysis, using community-based nurses or health care assistants, can overcome some of the barriers and enable frail older patients to have home-based dialysis treatment. Increasing age is associated with higher peritonitis rates among patients who started CPD in the 1990s, while age is not associated with peritonitis in more recent CPD cohorts, and no greater frequency of adverse outcomes of peritonitis has been seen among those who began CPD after the year 2000. In elderly dialysis patients, the management of quality of life (QOL) is important as well as adequacy of dialysis, nutritional status and survival rate. To obtain a good standard of QOL, it is essential to select carers who are properly educated and who can access an adequate support system, both physical and psychological, to help them cope with their burden.

N2  - A chronic disease in older adults usually runs a course that is less predictable  than in younger individuals. Unexplained variations in disease incidence, prognosis, therapeutic responses, and toxicity are frequently observed among older adults. This heterogeneity poses huge challenges to the current one-size-fits-all health care systems, and calls for more personalized managements of chronic diseases in older adults. Aging is characterized by progressive deterioration of bodily functions with increasing risk of failure over time. The entire process is hierarchically organized, and progresses from intracellular events to changes at systemic and ultimately organism levels at different rates among different individuals. Aging biology exerts great influences on the development and progression of most age-related chronic diseases. Thus, aging biology could contribute to the complexity of illnesses that increase with age, and aging biomarkers possess a great potential to enable personalized health risk assessment and health care. We review evidences supporting the roles of aging biomarkers in risk assessment of prevalent age-related diseases. Frailty phenotype is an objectively measured indicator of advanced-stage aging that is characterized by organism-level dysfunction. In contrast, altered inflammation markers level signifies an earlier stage between cellular abnormalities and systems dysfunction. Results of human observational studies and randomized controlled trials indicate that these measures, albeit simple, greatly facilitate classification of older patients with cancer, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus into groups that vary in disease incidence, prognosis and therapeutic response/toxicity. As the detailed mechanisms underlying the complex biologic process of aging are unraveled in the future, a larger array of biomarkers that correlate with biologic aging at different stages will be discovered. Following the translational research framework described in this article, these research efforts would result in innovations in disease prevention and management that address the huge unmet health needs of aging populations.

N2  - The metaphor of a frail older person as a car running out of petrol seems to have resonance in the lay media. Though it may be an over simplistic representation of a complex and dynamic process, it does facilitate discussion with patients and their relatives about the appropriateness of interventions, such as whether or not there is enough fuel (physiological reserves) to get up a really steep hill (undergo a coronary bypass graft). It can also be used as a way to emphasise what can be done to help. For example, in some longitudinal studies, 5% of older patients are less frail after 5 years follow up, suggesting there are things that can still be done to “fill up the tank”. This review will consider whether drug therapies can fulfil this role. Frail older people are often prescribed long lists of medications but it is debatable whether current treatments actually address the causes or consequences of frailty itself. Here, we explore the associations between frailty and co-morbidity and evaluate whether the management of chronic disease may impact frailty development or progression. We consider how the management of hypertension may have an important role in the prevention of frailty, mediated by reduction of cerebrovascular disease, but why aggressive management of hypertension may have negative consequences for those who are already frail. We also summarise the evidence linking immunosenescence, inflammation and endocrine changes to frailty and investigate whether targeted drug therapy has the potential to influence frailty pathophysiology.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in patients with CKD
N2  - Frailty is a distinct phenotype that is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and appears to be more prevalent with decreasing glomerular filtration rate. Exercise training or intervention to increase physical activity may ameliorate poor physical functioning and frailty, and even may improve survival in patients with CKD. Although exercise interventions improve outcomes across the spectrum of CKD, including patients treated with dialysis, patients treated with dialysis face barriers to exercise that patients with predialysis CKD do not. Rehabilitation at earlier stages of CKD (or prehabilitation before dialysis) might be more beneficial than not addressing the decreasing physical functioning and low physical activity until patients are receiving dialysis. This review summarizes available literature on frailty in the CKD and end-stage renal disease population, including exercise interventions and the limited evidence for prehabilitation as a strategy.

N2  - PURPOSE: Acetate in hemodialysis solutions exerts inflammatory, vasodilatatory and cardio-depressive effects. Citrate has been proposed as an optimal substitute. The aim of the present trial was the comparison of the hemodynamic and biological parameters on a group of patients dialysed consecutively with 4 acetate-free haemodialysis techniques. METHODS: In a prospective crossover manner, we measured the hemodynamic and biological effects of four acetate-free hemodialysis methods: he acetate-free biofiltration with variable potassium (AFBK) and three methods with a citrate buffer: onventional hemodialysis (HD), on-line hemodiafiltration (HDF) and on-line hemofiltration (HF). Fourteen chronic hemodialysis patients (9 males mean age 72.21+/-11.21 years old) underwent 6 four-hour dialysis sessions for 2 weeks on each of the 4 studied techniques. RESULTS: The AFBK technique presented less intradialytic hypotensive episodes (1 in 84 sessions) compared to the other techniques (HD: 29/84, HDF 22/82 and HF: 14/78; P<0.001). The blood pressure after one, two, three hours of dialysis and at the end of the hemodialysis session was significantly higher in the AFBK technique. On AFBK the net ultrafiltration (UF) (P<0.001) and the UF as a percentage of the dry weight (P=0.005) were significantly higher. A significant correlation between the prevalence of hypotensive episodes and the change of serum potassium levels (P=0.002) during the first hour of dialysis was detected. CONCLUSIONS: AFBK is associated with a better intradialytic hemodynamic tolerance and could be an optimal method for frail hypotension-prone hemodialysis patients.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The scope of this article is to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with the frailty of elderly people with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. This involved a correlational, cross-sectional study conducted in a dialysis center in the state of Sao Paulo. The sample consisted of 60 participants. The Participant Characterization Instrument was used for extracting sociodemographic and clinical data and the Edmonton Frail Scale was used to evaluate the level of frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with frailty. The mean age of the 60 patients included was 71.1 (+/- 6.9) years, predominantly male (70%), of which 36.7% were classified as frail. With respect to the factors associated with frailty among the variables of gender, age, self-reported skin color, schooling, monthly per capita income, hemodialysis time, number of associated diseases, falls in the year, hematocrit level, parathyroid hormone and use of calcitriol, it was found that only the monthly per capita income was significantly associated with frailty (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.1-0.9; p = 0.04). There was an association between frailty and income, showing that the elderly most at risk of frailty were those with lower income.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Frailty has been recognized as an important geriatric outcome predictor. However, few studies focus on its influence on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different self-report questionnaires for frailty assessment among these patients has not been attempted before. Methods: A prospectively enrolled rural chronic dialysis cohort was used for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered to these patients. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and clinical parameters/dialysis complications, including anemia, inflammation, and dyselectrolytemia were performed. Variables demonstrating significant correlations were further tested in multiple regression analyses to determine their associations. Results: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire were significantly associated with each other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated significantly with age (p = 0.02), female gender (p = 0.03), higher Liu’s comorbidity index (p = 0.02), lower serum albumin (p = 0.03) and creatinine levels (p < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (p = 0.02) (figure). The other 5 questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis confirmed an independently negative association between serum albumin and the simple FRAIL scale scores (p = 0.01). Conclusions: This is the first study establishing the utility of different self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients. This simple FRAIL scale demonstrated a stronger relationship with important dialysis-related complications.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Nocardiosis are uncommon. The diagnosis may be difficult, with significant morbidity and mortality, often occurring on frail patients. Few data are available in France. METHODS: A retrospective single center study was conducted from 2002 to 2014 and included all patients with at least one positive microbiological sample for Nocardia with a follow-up in our hospital. RESULTS: Nineteen patients, including 15 men, were included with a mean age of 58 years (25-85). Seventeen had a risk factor (lung diseases [13], corticosteroids [12], solid neoplasia [2], HIV infection [2], diabetes mellitus [3], kidney transplant [2], lymphopenia [1]). Infections' locations were: pulmonary (12), brain (3), skin (2), lymph node (1) and corneal (1). The slow growth leads to a median of 35 days for a positive result (3-95). Nine species were identified. Fifteen patients (79%) received one or more lines of antibiotics including: cotrimoxazole (9), amoxicillin (7) cefotaxime/ceftriaxone (7) imipenem (3), or amikacin (3). The average duration of antibiotic therapy was 207 days. Four patients did not receive antibiotics due to a late result or a bacterial co-infection masking nocardiosis. Five patients died (26%) including 2 with cerebral nocardiosis. Six patients were cured, 4 suffered a relapse, 4 had an unknown evolution, and 1 was still treated. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that nocardiosis is a disease difficult to treat. A better understanding of this type of infection is necessary.

N2  - Objectives: There is no consensus on the best immunosuppressive regimen
for elderly renal transplant recipients. The objective of this study was
to assess cytomegalovirus infection incidence and kidney transplant
outcomes in elderly recipients treated with mammalian target of
rapamycin inhibitors sirolimus/ tacrolimus at low doses compared with
those receiving tacrolimus/mycophenolate sodium.
Materials and Methods: In this single-center prospective randomized
study (Trial Registration No. NCT02683291), kidney transplant recipients
over 60 years of age were randomly allocated into 2 groups:
tacrolimus-sirolimus (21 patients) and tacrolimus-mycophenolate (23
patients). Cytomegalovirus infection rate and patient survival,
biopsy-proven acute rejection, and renal function at 12 months were
assessed.
Results: Cytomegalovirus infection rate was higher in the mycophenolate
group (60.9%) than in the sirolimus group (16.7%; P=.004). The rates
of biopsy-proven acute rejection, patient survival, graft survival, and
estimated glomerular filtration rate over 12 months did not
significantly differ between groups.
Conclusions: The incidence of cytomegalovirus infection was
significantly lower in the sirolimus group. The use of tacrolimus
combined with sirolimus in elderly kidney transplant recipients is safe.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - As people age, chronic kidney disease becomes more common, but it rarely leads to end-stage kidney disease. When it does, the choice between dialysis and conservative care can be daunting, as much depends on life expectancy and personal expectations of medical care. Shared decision making implies adequately informing patients about their options, and facilitating deliberation of the available information, such that decisions are tailored to the individual's values and preferences. Accurate estimations of one's risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease and death with or without dialysis are essential for shared decision making to be effective. Formal risk prediction models can help, provided they are externally validated, well-calibrated and discriminative; include unambiguous and measureable variables; and come with readily applicable equations or scores. Reliable, externally validated risk prediction models for progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage kidney disease or mortality in frail elderly with or without chronic kidney disease are scant. Within this paper, we discuss a number of promising models, highlighting both the strengths and limitations physicians should understand for using them judiciously, and emphasize the need for external validation over new development for further advancing the field.

N2  - Background-Recent findings suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) may
be associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).
Given the high prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD in the general
population, in depth analysis of this association is warranted.
Methods and Results-We pooled individual participant data from 5
community-based cohorts from Europe (second Nord-Trondelag Health Study
{[}HUNT2], Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease
{[}PREVEND], and the Tromso study) and the United States
(Atherosclerosis Risks in Communities {[}ARIC] and Cardiovascular Health
Study {[}CHS]) to assess the association of estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and CKD with objectively verified
VTE. To estimate adjusted hazard ratios for VTE, categorical and
continuous spline models were fit by using Cox regression with
shared-frailty or random-effect meta-analysis. A total of 1178 VTE
events occurred over 599 453 person-years follow-up. Relative to eGFR
100 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), hazard ratios for VTE were 1.29 (95%
confidence interval, 1.04-1.59) for eGFR 75, 1.31 (1.00-1.71) for eGFR
60, 1.82 (1.27-2.60) for eGFR 45, and 1.95 (1.26-3.01) for eGFR 30
mL/min per 1.73 m(2). In comparison with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio
(ACR) of 5.0 mg/g, the hazard ratios for VTE were 1.34 (1.04-1.72) for
ACR 30 mg/g, 1.60 (1.08-2.36) for ACR 300 mg/g, and 1.92 (1.19-3.09) for
ACR 1000 mg/g. There was no interaction between clinical categories of
eGFR and ACR (P=0.20). The adjusted hazard ratio for CKD, defined as
eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or albuminuria >= 30 mg/g, (versus no CKD)
was 1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.06). Associations were
consistent in subgroups according to age, sex, and comorbidities, and
for unprovoked versus provoked VTE, as well.
Conclusions-Both eGFR and ACR are independently associated with
increased risk of VTE in the general population, even across the normal
eGFR and ACR ranges. (Circulation. 2012;126:1964-1971.)

N2  - With the ageing of the population in the Western world, an increasing proportion  of patients seen in cardiology practice is represented by the elderly. Although approximately one third of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are >75 years old and the mortality rate in this age group is doubled compared with younger patients, this population is underrepresented in randomized controlled trials and, consequently, clinical guidelines do not always provide clear indications for the management of elderly patients. Therefore, there is an unmet need for clinical guidance regarding this rapidly growing subset of ACS patients, also considering that decisions about optimal antithrombotic treatment strategies in the elderly are often challenging, mostly due to age-related organ dysfunction, the frequency of comorbidities and concomitant medications and an increased risk of both ischemic and bleeding events. A panel of Italian cardiology experts assembled under the auspices of the Italian Society of Interventional Cardiology (SICI-GISE) for comprehensive discussion and consensus development, with the aim to provide practical recommendations, for both clinical and interventional cardiologists, regarding optimal management of antithrombotic therapy in patients with ACS aged >/=75 years. In this position paper, various clinical scenarios in patients with ST-elevation and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina are presented and discussed, including special subsets (e.g., patients aged >/=85 years, patients with chronic renal disease or previous cerebrovascular events, patients requiring triple therapy or long-term antithrombotic therapy), with the panel's recommendations being provided for each scenario.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis and is traditionally measured using tools that assess physical impairment. Alternate measurement tools highlight cognitive and functional domains, requiring clinician, patient, and/or caregiver input. In this study, we compared frailty measures for incident dialysis patients that incorporate patient, clinician, and caregiver perspectives with an aim to contrast the measured prevalence of frailty using tools derived from different conceptual frameworks. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients was conducted between February 2014 and June 2015. Frailty was assessed at dialysis onset using: 1) modified definition of Fried Phenotype (Dialysis Morbidity Mortality Study definition, DMMS); 2) Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS); 3) Frailty Assessment Care Planning Tool (provides CFS grading, FACT-CFS); and 4) Frailty Index (FI). Measures were compared via correlation and sensitivity/specificity analyses. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients participated (mean age of 61 +/- 14 years). Participants were primarily Caucasian (91%), male (58%), and the majority started on hemodialysis (83%). The median score for both the CFS and FACT-CFS was 4 (interquartile range of 3-5). The mean FI score was 0.31 (standard deviation +/- 0.16). The DMMS identified 78% of patients as frail. The FACT-CFS demonstrated highest correlation (r = 0.71) with the FI, while the DMMS was most sensitive (97%, 100%) and a CFS >/= 5 most specific (100%, 77%) at corresponding FI cutoff values (>0.21, >0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessments of incident dialysis patients that include clinician, caregiver and patient perspectives have moderate to strong correlation with the FI. At specified FI cutoff values, the FACT-CFS and DMMS are highly sensitive measures of frailty. The CFS and FACT-CFS may represent viable alternative screening tools in dialysis patients.

Aim 2: To determine the patterns of change in physical functioning and physical activity over the first 18 months of initiating dialysis therapy. Hypothesis 2: Physical functioning and physical activity will be maintained in patients initiating home dialysis therapy, whereas, those initiating in‐center dialysis will deteriorate in physical functioning and physical activity. Aim 3: To determine the effects of counseling and encouragement of physical activity in prevalent home dialysis patients on physical functioning, physical activity. Hypothesis 3: Compared to usual care, patients who are counseled and encouraged to participate in independent home walking exercise will improve physical functioning and health‐related quality of life. Aim 4: To determine the association of inflammation with physical functioning in home dialysis patients and with changes in physical activity. Hypothesis 4: Lower physical functioning is associated with inflammation and increased physical activity will improve physical functioning and reduce the associated inflammation.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Management of older people on dialysis requires focus on the wider aspects of aging as well as dialysis. Almost all frail and older patients receiving dialysis will default to in-center hemodialysis, although the availability of assisted peritoneal dialysis enables dialysis at home. As with any disease management decision, patients approaching end-stage renal disease need all the appropriate facts about their prognosis, the natural history of their disease without dialysis, and the resulting outcomes and complications of the different dialysis modalities. Hemodialysis in the older age group can be complicated by intradialytic hypotension, prolonged time to recovery, and vascular access-related problems. Peritoneal dialysis can be difficult for older patients with impaired physical or cognitive function and can become a considerable burden. Use of incremental dialysis, changes in hemodialysis frequency, and delivery and use of assistance for peritoneal dialysis can ameliorate quality of life for older patients. Understanding each individual's goals of care in the context of his or her life experience is particularly important in the elderly, when overall life expectancy is relatively short, and life experience or quality of life may be the priority. Indeed, some patients select the option of no dialysis or conservative care. With multifaceted assessments of care, physicians should be able to give individual patients the ability to select and continue to make the best decisions for their care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established. METHODS: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty status. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49 (36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61 points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p <0.01 for all comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p = 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p <0.001) were associated with worse frailty status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). CONCLUSIONS: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted interventions.

N2  - The health status of older people is frequently complicated by one or
more chronic diseases. Some conditions might have a different meaning in
certain groups of elderly subjects, like in frail people or older
patients with heart failure. Cut-off values defining these conditions
may require adjustment in such groups. Indeed, several such conditions
(e.g. obesity and hypercholesterolemia) have been discussed recently in
light of so-called paradoxical situations, which are -
counter-intuitively - associated with better outcome instead of a
negative impact on survival in the general population. Therefore,
different cut-off values may be needed in some groups of older subjects.
The pathophysiological mechanisms for these paradoxical situations need
to be understood in at least two different ways, causal and non-causal.
The aim of this review is to provide an overview of a variety of
conditions (obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes) in which
new cut-offs may have diagnostic, clinical, or prognostic value,
focusing on heart failure as a chronic disease, which is frequently
observed in older patients. Haemoglobin concentration may need a
different cut-off in heart failure for a reason other than paradox.
Namely, underlying iron deficiency itself, both in those with or without
anaemia, can have effects on symptoms and quality of life. Further
studies will be needed for re-defining cut-off values in heart failure
and maybe in the other chronic illnesses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

N2  - Prehabilitation is the process of enhancing preoperative functional capacity to improve tolerance for the upcoming stressor; it was associated with improved postoperative outcomes in a handful of studies, but never evaluated in transplantation. Kidney transplant (KT) candidates may be uniquely suited for prehabilitation because they experience a profound loss of functional capacity while waiting years on dialysis. To better understand the feasibility and effectiveness of prehabilitation in KT, we conducted a pilot study of center-based prehabilitation for candidates; this intervention consisted of weekly physical therapy sessions at an outpatient center with at-home exercises. We enrolled 24 participants; 18 participated in prehabilitation (75% of enrolled; 17% of eligible). 61% were male, 72% were African American, and mean age = 52 (SD = 12.9); 71% of participants had lower-extremity impairment, and 31% were frail. By 2 months of prehabilitation, participants improved their physical activity by 64% (P = 0.004) based on accelerometry. Participants reported high satisfaction. Among 5 prehabilitation participants who received KT during the study, length of stay was shorter than for age-, sex-, and race-matched control (5 vs 10 days; RR = 0.69; 95% CI:0.50-0.94; P = 0.02). These pilot study findings suggest that prehabilitation is feasible in pretransplant patients and may potentially be a strategy to improve post-KT outcomes.

N2  - Background: Frailty has been defined as a tool to define individuals who lack functional reserve and are at risk for functional decline. We hypothesized that chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) would be associated with a greater prevalence of frailty and disability in the elderly. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data collected from the Cardiovascular Health Study, which enrolled 5,888 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older from 4 clinical centers in the United States. Renal insufficiency is defined as a serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL or greater (≥115 μmol/L) in women and 1.5 mg/dL or greater (≥133 μmol/L) in men. Frailty is defined by the presence of 3 of the following abnormalities: unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, measured weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Disability is defined as any self-reported difficulty with activities of daily living. Results: Among 5,808 participants with creatinine levels measured at entry, 15.9% of men (n = 394) and 7.6% of women (n = 254) had CRI. Prevalences of frailty (15% versus 6%; P < 0.001) and disability (12% versus 7%; P = 0.001) were greater in participants with CRI compared with those with normal renal function. After multivariate adjustment for comorbidity, CRI remained significantly associated with frailty (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.41), but not disability (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.69). Conclusion: Elderly persons with CRI have a high prevalence of frailty, which may signal their risk for progression to adverse health outcomes. If confirmed in other studies, identification of frailty in patients with CRI may warrant special interventions to preserve their independence, quality of life, and survival. © 2004 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is the concept of accumulating physiologic declines that make people less able to deal with stressors, including surgery. Prehabilitation is intervention to enhance functional capacity before surgery. Frailty and prehabilitation among transplant populations and the role of wearable fitness tracking devices (WFTs) in delivering fitness-based interventions will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty is associated with increased complications, longer length of hospital stay and increased mortality after surgery. Frail kidney transplant patients have increased delayed graft function, mortality and early hospital readmission. Frail lung or liver transplant patients are more likely to delist or die on the waitlist. Prehabilitation can mitigate frailty and has resulted in decreased length of hospital stay and fewer postsurgical complications among a variety of surgical populations. Increasingly, WFTs are used to monitor patient activity and improve patient health. Interventions using WFTs have resulted in improved activity, weight loss and blood pressure. SUMMARY: Frailty is a measurable parameter that identifies patients at risk for worse health outcomes and can be mitigated through intervention. Prehabilitation to reduce frailty has been shown to improve postsurgical outcomes in a variety of populations. WFTs are being integrated in healthcare delivery for monitoring and changing health behavior with promising results.

N2  - As people live longer, chronic illness care will consume an ever-larger
part of a nation's financial resources. With the `baby-boomer'
generation reaching retirement age beginning in 2011, there will be an
increased demand for chronic services/care in the population aged 65
years and older. Innovative approaches to quality care must be sought,
while understanding the financial costs associated with the delivery of
such care to the geriatric population. Elderly persons utilize more
physical resources and it is important to identify early those
beneficiaries who would benefit medically from intervention.
Disease management is built on a model of integrated care, with each
member of the healthcare team working together toward a common set of
objectives. The ultimate goal is to keep the patient functioning well in
an outpatient setting, thus avoiding the high debility and costs
associated with hospitalization and institutionalization. Creating such
a system requires a substantial investment in infrastructure. The
concept of `spending $5.00 to save $10.00' must be incorporated into
the planning process. In chronically ill seniors there is a need for
care as well as cure, which involves improving function and quality of
life (QOL) for the frail elders by paying attention to the psychological
and socioeconomic status in addition to the physical condition. Small
gains in function can mean large gains in patients' QOL. Reducing the
progression of functional decline among the physically frail who live at
home is a goal. Home visits are a critical component of the total care
delivered.
Changing physician behavior to accept the tenets of disease management
requires education in advance of launching such a program. There must be
healthcare team buy-in for a program to achieve success. Personnel
requirements include senior nurses, social workers, physical therapists
and nutritionists, supported by a sophisticated information technology
system. Components of an information technology system must allow for
adequate data collection and subsequent generation of reports.
Continuous quality improvement will occur only if such a system is in
place.
While the average chronologic age of the patient with end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) is almost 62 years, the physiologic age is much older.
Therefore, ESRD serves as a model for chronic illness that affects a
geriatric population and the benefits achieved by a disease management
approach to this chronic disease are noted.
Disease management improved glycemic control in the ESRD patient with
diabetes mellitus by establishing a protocol for frequency of
measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA(1c)). For this population
at risk, a decreased hospitalization rate for diabetic complications
resulted from this initiative. Also, a vascular access initiative in the
described ESRD disease management program resulted in an increase in the
creation of arterio-venous fistulas and a decrease in the placement of
tunneled-cuff catheters. Fistula creation was associated with less
infections and access thrombosis compared with catheter use for access.
QOL improved for these patients with ESRD because of decreased
hospitalization rate for access-related issues. Significant cost savings
were achieved because of fewer hospital admissions and a decrease in the
number of bed days per year.
The lessons learned from the ESRD model can help in developing future
disease management programs for the geriatric population.

N2  - This study investigated mortality in 568 individuals from the Goessel Mennonite community in rural central Kansas. There were three main objectives to this research: 1) characterize mortality trends within a biologically well-defined Mennonite community; 2) determine what biochemical, morphological, and physiological risk factors could be related to all-cause mortality, stratified by age and sex; and 3) compare these results to previously described variables that were associated with both biological age and mortality in this population. Mortality data were obtained from three sources: Kansas Vital Records, the Social Security death index, and church records. In total, 221 (39%) individuals were found to have died in this population between January 1980-June 2002. Analogous to the larger US population, the three leading causes of death in this community were heart disease, cancer, and stroke, accounting for 60% of all deaths. Besides advancing age, the greatest biological risk factor in this population was decreased amounts of albumin in men (relative risk, 2.47), potentially indicating underreported cases of either chronic kidney disease or frailty syndrome for males. Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated that increased amounts of total cholesterol may provide a protective effect for elderly individuals. We conclude, based on the previously described heritability of both albumin (h(2) = 0.40) and total cholesterol (h(2) = 0.50) in this population, that underlying genetic factors associated with both chronic degenerative diseases and biological aging may have important implications for understanding mortality patterns in this community.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: The risk of incorrect medication dosing is high in frail older people. Therefore, accurate assessment of the glomerular filtration rate is important. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the estimated glomerular filtration rate using creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, in frail older people. We hypothesized that frailty determines the difference between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae. METHODS: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C was determined using (cross-sectional) data of 55 patients (mean age 73 years) admitted to a psychiatric ward for older adults. The level of agreement of these estimations was assessed by a Bland-Altman analysis. In all patients, the Rockwood's Frailty Index was derived and correlated with the mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C. RESULTS: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine (mean 71.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and CKD-EPI cystatin C (mean 57.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was 13.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (p < 0.0001). The two standard deviation limit in the Bland-Altman plot was large (43.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), which represents a low level of agreement. The Frailty Index did not correlate with the mean difference between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based glomerular filtration rate (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.182, p = 0.184). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant gap between a creatinine- and cystatin C-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate, irrespective of frailty. The range of differences between the commonly used estimated glomerular filtration rate formulae might result in clinically relevant differences in drug prescription and differences in chronic kidney disease staging.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years. Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically, overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

N2  - AIM: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty, but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited. Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not (Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined the risk factors for frailty. RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients (n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty. CONCLUSIONS: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 1597-1602.

N2  - Background and objectives Hypertension is the most important treatable
risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes. Many patients with CKD are
elderly, but the ideal BP in these individuals is unknown.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements From among 339,887
patients with incident eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, we examined
associations of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) with all -cause
mortality, incident coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic strokes, and
ESRD from the time of developing CKD until the end of follow-up (July
26, 2013, for mortality, CHD, and stroke, and December 31, 2011, for
ESRD) in multivariableadjusted survival models categorized by patients'
age.
Results Of the total cohort, 300,424 (88%) had complete data for
multivariable analysis. Both SBP and DBP showed a U-shaped association
with mortality. SBP displayed a linear association with CHD, stroke, and
ESRD, whereas DBP showed no consistent association with either. SBP>140
mmHg was associated with higher incidence of all examined outcomes, but
with an incremental attenuation of the observed risk in older compared
with younger patients (P<0.05 for interaction) The adjusted hazard
ratios and 95% confidence intervals associated with SBP170 mmHg
(compared with 130-139 mmHg) in patients <50, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and
>80 years were 1.95 (1.34 to 2.84), 2.01 (1.75 to 2.30), 1.68 (1.49 to
1.89), 1.39 (1.25 to 1.54), and 1.30 (1.17 to 1.44), respectively. The
risk of incident CHD, stroke, and ESRD was incrementally higher with
higher SBP in patients aged <80 years but showed no consistent
association in those aged >80 years (P<0.05 for interaction for all
outcomes).
Conclusions In veterans with incident CKD, SBP showed different
associations in older versus younger patients. The association of higher
SBP with adverse outcomes was present but markedly reduced in older
individuals, especially in those aged >80 years. Elevated DBP showed no
consistent association with vascular outcomes in patients with incident
CKD.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high morbidity, mortality, and symptom burden. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) often contribute to these burdens and should be considered when providing recommendations for care. This review aims to summarize recent literature relevant to the provision of palliative and end-of-life care for patients with progressive CKD and specifically highlights issues relevant to those with CVD and CHF. RECENT FINDINGS: Dialysis may not benefit older, frail patients with progressive CKD, especially those with other comorbidities. Patients managed conservatively (i.e., without dialysis) may live as long as patients who elect to start dialysis, with better preservation of function and quality of life and with fewer acute care admissions. Decisions regarding dialysis initiation should be made on an individual basis, keeping in mind each patient's goals, comorbidities, and underlying functional status. Conservative management of progressive kidney disease is frequently not offered but is likely to benefit many older, frail patients with comorbidities such as CHF and CVD. SUMMARY: A palliative approach to the care of many patients with progressive CKD is essential to ensuring they receive appropriate quality care.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that in the very elderly dialysis patients in the United States, institutionalization in nursing homes would increase mortality in addition to age alone. METHODS: Incident dialysis patients from 2001 to 2008 above the age of 70 were included. Patients above 70 were categorized into 4 groups according to age as 70-75, 76-80, 81-85, and >85 years and further divided into institutionalized and noninstitutionalized. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to assess patient survival. RESULTS: A total of 349,440 patients were identified above the age of 70 at the time of initiation of dialysis. For institutionalized patients, the mean survival was significantly lower, 1.71 +/- 0.03 years for those in the age range 70-75, 1.44 +/- 0.02 years for those in the age range 76-80, 1.25 +/- 0.02 years for those in the age range 81-85, and 1.04 +/- 0.02 for those in the >85 years age group (p = 0.0001). The hazard ratio for mortality in institutionalized elderly patients on dialysis was 1.80 ([95% CI 1.77-1.83]; p = 0.0001). After adjustment for other variables (multivariate Cox regression), to be institutionalized was still an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.57 [95% CI 1.54-1.60]; p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: There was increased mortality in institutionalized elderly patients as compared to noninstutionalized elderly patients in the same age group. In accordance with the increased frailty and decreased benefits of therapies in the very elderly, especially in those with additional co-morbidities besides age, palliative and end-of-life care should be considered.

N2  - Introduction: People with chronic kidney disease, who are haemodialysis (HD)-dependent, rely on functioning vascular access to enable effective regular treatment. The native arteriovenous fistula has reduced risk of complication and increased long-term viability; therefore, it is considered the optimal vascular access. Appropriate cannulation technique is vital to maintain fistula viability and reduce risk of access-related complications. Two differing cannulation techniques predominate the HD community worldwide, 'rope laddering' and 'buttonholing'. A third technique, 'area puncturing' is less widely used.The following literature review was undertaken to assess the clinical benefits of buttonhole cannulation for HD. Search strategies: Current literature published that discusses buttonhole cannulation of native arteriovenous fistulas was systematically searched utilising three different electronic databases: Current Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus and Medline via Pubmed. Findings: Five major themes were identified: increased infection rates, reduced pain, decreased aneurysm development, reduced haematoma formation and shortened time to achieve haemostasis post-treatment. Discussion: Buttonhole cannulation may provide several benefits to HD-dependent individuals with a functioning arteriovenous fistula, many of which may be attributed to the use of blunt needles. It requires a different needling technique to rope ladder cannulation. Strict adherence to aseptic technique is vital as clinical benefits ofthe buttonhole technique may be overshadowed by an increase in infective complications. Conclusion: The buttonhole technique potentially may provide benefits for individuals with frail arteriovenous fistulae or limited cannulation area. Careful consideration must be given regarding patient preference, fistula characteristics and the primary cannulator before selecting cannulation technique.

N2  - Background Cachexia describes a complex pathological syndrome of muscle
wasting, anorexia and weight loss. Progesterone therapies have been
shown to improve appetite and promote weight gain in patients with
cachexia; however, research has focused heavily on patients with cancer,
and its effectiveness in other diseases remains unclear.
Aims This systematic review aimed to present the evidence available for
progesterone therapy as a treatment for non-cancer cachexia.
Method Surrogate outcome measures used were weight change, lean body
mass (LBM), muscle strength, appetite, health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) and serum albumin. Both randomised and non-randomised trials
were included. A literature search of clinical trials using the medical
subject heading (MeSH) terms `cachexia' OR `anorexia' OR `weight' OR
`frail (truncated)' OR `appetite' OR `wasting syndrome' PLUS `megestrol
acetate' OR `medroxyprogesterone acetate' was performed.
Results Eighteen studies were included in this review; 12 randomised
control trials and 6 non-randomised trials. This collated results from
916 patients with HIV/AIDS, end-stage renal failure, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and geriatric cachexia. Meta-analysis comparing
progesterone therapy with placebo concluded mean change in weight was
not significant (mean difference (MD) 1.56, 95% CI -0.36 to 3.52,
p=0.12). There was little evidence to show significant impact on LBM,
and no trials looked at muscle strength. There was a paucity of evidence
looking at appetite and HRQOL; however, results were generally positive.
Conclusions Current evidence does not support the use of progesterone
therapies for non-cancer cachexia. There may however be a limited role
for its use as an appetite stimulant in a palliative context on a
case-by-case basis.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the acute and late outcomes of a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) program including both the transfemoral (TF) and transapical (TA) approaches; and 2) to determine the results of TAVI in patients deemed inoperable because of either porcelain aorta or frailty.; Background: Very few data exist on the results of a comprehensive TAVI program including both TA and TF approaches for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk.; Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with the Edwards valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, California) between January 2005 and June 2009 in 6 Canadian centers were included.; Results: A total of 345 procedures (TF: 168, TA: 177) were performed in 339 patients. The predicted surgical mortality (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score) was 9.8 +/- 6.4%. The procedural success rate was 93.3%, and 30-day mortality was 10.4% (TF: 9.5%, TA: 11.3%). After a median follow-up of 8 months (25th to 75th interquartile range: 3 to 14 months) the mortality rate was 22.1%. The predictors of cumulative late mortality were peri-procedural sepsis (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48 to 8.28) or need for hemodynamic support (HR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.11 to 6), pulmonary hypertension (PH) (HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.38 to 3.84), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.83). Patients with either porcelain aorta (18%) or frailty (25%) exhibited acute outcomes similar to the rest of the study population, and porcelain aorta patients tended to have a better survival rate at 1-year follow-up.; Conclusions: A TAVI program including both TF and TA approaches was associated with comparable mortality as predicted by surgical risk calculators for the treatment of patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk, including porcelain aorta and frail patients. Baseline (PH, COPD, CKD) and peri-procedural (hemodynamic support, sepsis) factors but not the approach determined worse outcomes.; Copyright  2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The number of elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD) has increased in recent years, and the best therapeutic approach has not been determined due to a lack of evidence. OBJECTIVES: To observe the progression of elderly patients with ACKD (stages 4 and 5) and to compare the survival of stage 5 CKD patients with and without dialysis treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients >/=70 years who began ACKD follow-up from 01/01/2007 to 31/12/2008 were included, and their progression was observed until 31/12/2013. Demographic data, the Charlson comorbidity index, history of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 314 patients >/=70 years with stages 4 and 5 CKD were studied. Of these patients, 162 patients had stage 5 CKD at the beginning of follow-up or progressed to stage 5 during the study, and 69 of these patients were treated with dialysis. In the stage 5 group: median age was 77 years (74-81); 48% had IHD; 50% had DM, Charlson 7 (6-9). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis: >/=70 years (93 vs. 69 patients with dialysis, log rank: 15 P<.001); patients >/=75 years (74 vs. 46 patients with dialysis, log rank: 8.9 P=.003); patients >/=80 (40 vs. 15 patients with dialysis) and p=0,2. Patients receiving dialysis were younger, with a lower Charlson comorbidity index and shorter follow-up time. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that dialysis treatment improves survival, although this benefit is lost in patients >/=80 years.

N2  - Elderly patients are the largest and fastest growing group of patients with chronic kidney disease maintained on dialysis in the world. Because of advanced age and a heavy burden of comorbidities, the elderly are usually not candidates for kidney transplantation and are less likely to be offered peritoneal dialysis (PD). There is, however, growing evidence that the use of community nurses to assist with PD and the introduction of programs for assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) targeting these frail, elderly patients may enable more elderly patients to have their PD treatment at home. Suitable candidates for aPD are incident end-stage kidney disease patients preferring PD but unable to perform their own treatment because of comorbidities, physical disabilities, or psychosocial problems; prevalent, previous autonomous PD patients who have lost their independence because of advanced age or an increased burden of comorbidities; or prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients switched from HD to aPD because of their own preference, failure of vascular access for HD, or an inability to tolerate HD. We believe that aPD in the future will prove to be a safe and feasible complementary alternative to in-center HD for the growing group of frail, elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease.

N2  - The recent epidemiologic data pointed out, that the general number of
patients on hemodialysis is steadily increasing, especially in group of
elderly patients over 75 years old. The geriatric syndromes are
amultietiological disorder related to physiological aging and partly
associated with comorbid conditions. Frailty, falls, functional decline
and disability, cognitive impairment and depression are main geriatric
syndromes and occurs in patients with impaired renal function more often
than among general population. The causes of higher prevalence of those
syndromes are not well known, but uremic environment and overall renal
replacement therapy may have an important impact on its progress. The
patient with geriatric syndrome require comprehensive treatment as well
as physical rehabilitation, psychiatric cure and support in everyday
activities.
Herein below we would like to review recent literature regarding to
particular features of main geriatric syndromes in agroup of

older Americans. J Intern Med 2010; 268: 171-180.
Objective.
To explore the relation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and
frailty. Frailty is a multidimensional phenotype that describes
declining physical function and a vulnerability to adverse outcomes in
the setting of physical stress such as illness or hospitalization. Low
serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are known to be associated
with multiple chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and
diabetes, in addition to all cause mortality.
Design.
Using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES
III), we evaluated the association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
concentration and frailty, defined according to a set of criteria
derived from a definition previously described and validated.
Subjects.
Nationally representative survey of noninstitutionalized US residents
collected between 1988 and 1994.
Results.
25-Hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, defined as a serum concentration < 15 ng
mL-1, was associated with a 3.7-fold increase in the odds of frailty
amongst whites and a fourfold increase in the odds of frailty amongst
non-whites. This association persisted after sensitivity analyses
adjusting for season of the year and latitude of residence, intended to
reduce misclassification of persons as 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficient or
insufficient.
Conclusion.
Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are associated with frailty
amongst older adults.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although therapeutic failure may be a common cause of drug-related morbidity in older adults, few studies have focused on this problem. The study objective was to determine the frequency and types of, and the factors associated with, therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients, using a new instrument named the Therapeutic Failure Questionnaire (TFQ). METHODS: The sample included 106 frail, hospitalised elderly patients enrolled in a 1-year-long health service intervention trial at 11 Veterans Affairs Medical Centres. The TFQ was developed by a team of clinical geriatricians and tested for reliability by two clinical pharmacists and a geriatrician on a sample of 32 patients. To establish validity, a geriatrician retrospectively reviewed the computerised medication records and clinical charts for these patients and applied the TFQ to determine probable therapeutic failures at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: Inter- and intra-rater reliability for the TFQ were very good (kappa = 0.82 for both). Overall, 11% of patients had one or more probable therapeutic failures (TFQ scores between 4 and 7) leading to hospitalisation. Cardiopulmonary disease was a common 'indicator' of therapeutic failure and was often the result of non-adherence. The only factor associated with therapeutic failure occurrence was severe chronic kidney disease (crude odds ratio 5.87; 95% CI 1.20, 28.69; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The TFQ was able to identify several cases of probable therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients. Non-adherence to effective therapies for chronic serious cardiopulmonary disease was a common cause of therapeutic failure and represents a target for interventions to reduce hospitalisation. Further research on the occurrence, risk factors for and types of therapeutic failure is needed in a larger cohort of older non-veterans.

N2  - End stage renal disease diabetic patients suffer from worse clinical outcomes under dialysis-independently of modality. Peritoneal dialysis offers them the advantages of home therapy while sparing their frail vascular capital and preserving residual renal function. Other benefits and potential risks deserve discussion. Predialysis intervention with early nephrology referral, patient education, and multidisciplinary support are recommended. Skilled and updated peritoneal dialysis protocols must be prescribed to assure better survival. Optimized volume control, glucose-sparing peritoneal dialysis regimens, and elective use of icodextrin are key therapy strategies. Nutritional evaluation and support, preferential use of low-glucose degradation products solutions, and prescription of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system acting drugs should also be part of the panel to improve diabetic care under peritoneal dialysis.

Little is known about the association of renal insufficiency with inflammatory and procoagulant markers, which are potential mediators for the cardiovascular risk of kidney disease. Methods and Results— The cross-sectional association of renal insufficiency with 8 inflammatory and procoagulant factors was evaluated using baseline data from the Cardiovascular Health Study, a population-based cohort study of 5888 subjects aged ≥65 years. C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, factor VIIc, and factor VIIIc levels were measured in nearly all participants; interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, plasmin-antiplasmin complex, and D-dimer levels were measured in nearly half of participants. Renal insufficiency was defined as a serum creatinine level ≥1.3 mg/dL in women and ≥1.5 mg/dL in men. Multivariate linear regression wa...

N2  - Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a life-threatening renal infection caused by gas-producing bacteria and fungi. It usually occurs in patients with diabetes and patients with urinary tract obstruction. A combination of systemic antibiotics, percutaneous catheter drainage, or open nephrectomy is typically required to achieve cure. Because of grim prognosis, resorting to interventional methods is frequently inevitable. We report the case of a 77-year-old woman with diabetes and end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis that presented with fever and left flank pain. A bubbly gas pattern inside the left kidney was demonstrated on abdominal computed tomography scan and blood cultures grew Escherichia coli. She was successfully treated solely with systemic antibiotics. This highlights the fact that prompt recognition of imaging findings associated with benign prognosis is essential for a favorable outcome. It allows for an effective management avoiding high-risk interventions, especially in frail patients with multiple comorbidities. Finally, we review all published cases of EPN in chronic dialysis patients.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Aim of our study is to describe, in people with CKD, the demographic  and clinical characteristics and outcomes with increasing age. The prevalence of CKD in Western populations, where longevity is the norm, is about 10-15%, but how age influence different characteristics of patients with CKD is largely not known. METHODS: One thousand two hundred sixty-five patients enrolled in the CKD.QLD registry at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital were grouped according to age at consent i.e. <35, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+ years age groups, and were followed till start of renal replacement therapy (RRT), death, discharge or the censor date of September 2015. RESULTS: Age ranged from 17.6 to 98.5 years with medians of 70.1 and 69.9 years for males and females respectively: 7% were <35 years of age, with the majority (63%) >65 years old. The leading renal diagnoses changed from genetic real disease (GRD) and glomerulonephritis (GN) in the younger patients to renovascular disease (RVD) and hypertension (HTN) in older patients. With increasing age, there were often multiple renal disease diagnoses, more advanced stages of CKD, greater number of comorbidities, more frequent and more costly hospitalizations, and higher death rates. The rates of initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) rose from 4.5 per 100 person years in those age < 35 years to a maximum of 5.5 per 100 person years in 45-54 years age group and were lowest, at 0.5 per 100 person years in those >85 years. Mortality rates increased by age group from 1.3 to 17.0 per 100 person years in 35-44 year and 85+ year age groups respectively. Rates of hospitalization, length of stay and cost progressively increased from the youngest to eldest groups. Patients with diabetic nephropathy had highest incidence rate of RRT and death. The proportion of patients who lost more than 5mls/min/1.73m(2) of eGFR during at least 12 months follow up increased from 13.3% in the youngest age group to 29.2% in the eldest. CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive view, with no exclusions, of CKD patients seen in a public renal specialty referral practice, in Australia. The age distribution of patients encompasses the whole of adult life, with a broader range and higher median value than patients receiving RRT. Health status ranged from a single system (renal) disease in young adults through, with advancing age, renal impairment as a component of, or accompanying multisystem diseases, to demands and complexities of support of frail or elderly people approaching end of life. This great spectrum demands a broad understanding and capacity of renal health care providers, and dictates a need for a wider scope of health services provision incorporating multiple models of care.

N2  - Introduction: Labeling a patient as "frail" may be useful in assessing the prognosis and therapeutic approach. Objective: The aim of the study is to define a pattern of frailty among our dialysis population, to analyse the incidence and clinical evolution of these patients. Materials and Methods: We analysed a total of 320 patients with stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were on hemodialysis between September 2014 and September 2015. To define a patient as frail we used the Fried phenotype model, and we added a new criteria-dialysis session length longer than 12 hours/week. Results: 5.6% of the 320 patients were frail. We found statistically significant differences regarding body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin (Hgb), and serum albumin, as well as the ability to perform the basic activities of daily living (p < 0.005), ability to ambulate (p = 0.01) and perform transfers (p < 0.005). We found statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of hospital admissions (p = 0.005) and mortality (p < 0.005). Conclusion: 5.6% of the study population were frail, with lower BMI, serum albumin and hemoglobin, lower capacity for basic activities of daily living, ambulation, and transference, as well as higher morbidity and mortality.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Pain is one of the most common symptoms among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and is often under recognized and not adequately managed in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Barriers to adequate pain management include poor awareness of the problem, insufficient medical education, fears of possible drug-related side effects, and common misconceptions about the inevitability of pain in elderly and HD patients. Caregivers working in HD should be aware of the possible consequences of inadequate pain assessment and management. Common pain syndromes in HD patients include musculoskeletal diseases and metabolic neuropathies, associated with typical intradialytic pain. Evaluating the etiology, nature, and intensity of pain is crucial for choosing the correct analgesic. A mechanism-based approach to pain management may result in a better outcome. Pharmacokinetic considerations on clearance alterations and possible toxicity in patients with ESRD should drive the right analgesic prescription. Comorbidities and polymedications may increase the risk of drug-drug interactions, therefore drug metabolism should be taken into account when selecting analgesic drugs. Automedication is common among HD patients but should be avoided to reduce the risk of hazardous drug administration. Further research is warranted to define the efficacy and safety of analgesic drugs and techniques in the context of patients with ESRD as generalizing information from studies conducted in the general population could be inappropriate and potentially dangerous. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for the management of complex pain syndromes in frail patients, such as those suffering from ESRD.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The aortic valve is a semilunar valve with three leaflets, which lies at the junction of left ventricle and aorta. It allows unidirectional blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. Because of the highly complex and sophisticated cellular and molecular functions, the thin valve leaflet can withstand extreme mechanical and hemodynamic forces with every cardiac cycle.[1] Various factors including age and congenital defects can compromise the normal valvular function leading to a wide variety of complications.[2] Although bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are the most common congenital abnormality, congenital valve defects can range from aortic atresia (missing or incomplete closure of aortic valves) to a sub or supra-valvular stenosis. BAV is reported to have an incidence of 1 to 2% with a male predominance. Lack of microfibrillar proteins during valvulogenesis has been reported to affect the leaflet development where two leaflets are fused to form one large leaflet. It frequently correlates with aortic abnormalities such as aortic dilation (root, ascending and arch) and coarctation of the aorta.[3] The bicuspid aortic valve leaflets can undergo accelerated calcific degeneration because of abnormal hemodynamic forces. Congenital abnormalities including BAV can lead to various valvular complications including aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation leading to an increased risk to infective endocarditis, which has a reported incidence of 12 to 39% in BAV.[3] Unless severe, BAV generally remains asymptomatic till the age of 50 to 60 years. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a narrowing of the valve aperture reducing the aortic valve area. Increased resistance to blood flow and transvalvular pressure gradient causes increased left ventricle workload causing hypertrophy. Its prevalence increases with age and can be as high as 4.6% in people greater than age 75 years. Being the most common valvular disease in Europe and America, estimates are that 3.5 million people in England alone will have AS by the year 2020.[4] Calcific degeneration leading to stiffening and restriction motion of valve leaflet is the most common cause of AS. Disruption of endothelium lining on the aortic side caused by increased mechanical stress seem to be the inciting event. Posterior leaflets are reported to be affected the most.[5] Rheumatic fever causing inflammation of the leaflets is still the leading cause of AS in developing countries. AS can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms of syncope, angina and heart failure.[6] Severe AS is fatal with a 50% mortality at 2 years.[7] As per The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, AS is graded severe when the orifice area is less than 1.0 cm, the mean gradient is greater than 40 mmHg or the jet velocity is greater than 4 m/s. Prognosis is poor in symptomatic or severe cases unless the valve is replaced. Up to 30% of patients aged > 75 do not undergo surgical valve replacement either because of technical reasons; this may include porcelain aorta, general frailty, refusal to undergo surgery, and serious comorbid conditions.[8] The operative death risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is as high as 10% in patients with LV dysfunction, chronic renal disease, and advanced age.[9] Trans-catheter aortic valve replacement and trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR/TAVI) have emerged as a more feasible and less risky option for patients not suitable for surgery. Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the backflow of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle when the valve leaflets fail to coapt. Common causes include congenital defects, calcific degeneration, infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever, and trauma.[10][11][12][13] Ventricular hypertrophy in chronic cases accommodates increased volume to maintain the normal stroke volume and end-diastolic pressure; hence, chronic AR can be asymptomatic for decades.[14] In contrast, with acute cases of AR, ventricles do not have enough time to undergo the needed changes such as hypertrophy to accommodate increased volumes. Because of decreased stroke volume, the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output but is insufficient to meet the demand resulting in increased left atrial pressure, pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. On physical examination, AR murmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after the aortic component of S (A); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal intercostal space. It also has associations with various other murmurs including: "Mid-systolic murmur" because of rapid ejection of an overload of blood from the left ventricle, "Austin Flint" murmur is mid-to-late diastolic murmur due to partial closure of mitral valve during ventricular systole because of regurgitant flow from aortic valve, "Cole-Cecil" is a diastolic murmur due to the fusion of an aortic murmur with the S3 because of simultaneous filling of the left ventricle from left atrium and AR. History of valvular surgery Dr. Theodore Tuffier, in 1912, used his finger to free the fused leaflets of a stenosed aortic valve.[15] Before the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mitral valve repair involved commissurotomy through access from the left atrial chamber. Thomas Homes Sellors performed first pulmonary valvulotomy in 1948 by using a tenotomy knife.[16] Charles Hufnagel developed the first artificial valve based on a reciprocating ball and cage. It was used to prevent backflow of blood into the ventricles due to aortic insufficiency.[17] CPB machine revolutionized the valve replacement in the anatomical position. Dr. Dwight Harken and his colleagues performed the first successful aortic valve replacement. Later that year, Drs. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards performed mitral valve replacement.[18] Bioprosthetic valves are closer in function to natural valves but have a limited life expectancy, whereas, Mechanical valves are more durable but require anticoagulation. The choice of valves, among other factors, depends upon the patient's age and well-being. Mechanical heart valves are known to last for approximately 25 years. Seventy different mechanical heart valves have been developed since 1960.[19] Ball and cage, bi-leaflet, and tilting disc are the common ones. Modification of the ball valve by Dr. Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards entailed developing a cage made of lucite with a silicone elastomer ball. The cage material was later changed to stainless steel and then cobalt-chromium alloys. The Starr-Edward valve also has a Teflon sewing ring, which enabled suturing into mitral and later into the aortic position.[20] Increased thrombogenicity has been a significant issue, for which valves underwent several modifications such as measures to reduce metal contact by covering the struts with cloth and using Silastic shields. Other issues included hemolysis due to excessive rubbing of the ball against the sewing ring and occlusion of coronary ostia because of high profile. Despite these issues, these valves showed the feasibility of prosthetic valve enabling Starr-Edwards to draw design criteria. Basic points included that the valves should be chemically inert, biocompatible, a-traumatic to blood, and non-thrombogenic.[21] In 1965, Kay-Shiley's non-rotating disc valve replaced the ball with a single disc but demonstrated poor hemodynamics and hemolysis and was discontinued. Bjork-Shiley in 1969 developed a tilting-disc valve, which overcame the problems with the single-disc valve. Free rotation of disc between metal struts allows it to open by tilting at a 60-degree angle. Bjork-Shiley replaced the flat with the convexo-concave disc to create a larger orifice in 1975 but were the object of a recall due to fracture of welded struts.[22] Medtronic Hall valve developed by Dr. Karl Hall and Robert Kaster is the most common tilting disc valve. Perforation in the middle of the disc served as a guide and an improved tilting angle.[23] In 1977, St Jude Medical developed Bi-leaflet valve, which comprised two semi-circular flaps with hinges close to the center of the orifice. Stagnation of blood flow leading to thrombus formation around the hinge region was a problem with the bi-leaflet valve.[15] A newly developed valve resolved this issue with a valve in which the continuous 360-degree rotation around the central axis of the valve ensured an even distribution of blood flow and prevent thrombus formation.[16] Predisposition for thrombosis, embolism, need for lifelong anticoagulation therapy are drawbacks of mechanical valves. Bioprosthetic valves can either be an allograft (cadaver or Ross procedure) or, a xenograft (native or pericardium). The Ross procedure involves replacing the diseased aortic valve with the patient's own pulmonary valve (autograft) and replace the pulmonary valve with aortic or pulmonary allograft. The pulmonary autograft grows with the patient and does not induce an immunologic response. The most common xenografts are porcine aortic valves and bovine pericardial valves. Lonescu-Shiley developed xenograft valves by using bovine pericardium on a titanium stent in 1971 but was later withdrawn in 1987 due to structural failure including abrasive tears because of fabric-tissue interface and leaflet calcification. Carpentier-Edwards bovine pericardial valve overcame those issues by making some structural modifications, like stitching pericardium to the inside of the fabric and using flexible stent posts. Although biological valves have better hemodynamics compared to mechanical valves, they have a shorter lifespan because of calcification, which stiffens the valve leaflets. Tissues engineering, a field in regenerative medicine restores and maintains the function of living tissues. Skin graft for burn victims is an example. Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) are perceived to be non-thrombogenic, and infection resistant. With advancement in material science and

N2  - Hip fracture is a common occurrence in the elderly. Due to the growing demand for the specific care of these patients, we established the Orthogeriatric Unit (OGU) at San Gerardo University Hospital (Italy) in 2007. However, simultaneous bilateral femoral neck fractures among the geriatric population (those aged >/=65 years) are rarely reported in the literature. Reporting the rare case of a frail 76-year-old woman admitted with bilateral hip fracture and end-stage renal disease, we explain the important role played by the OGU and its flexible multidisciplinary approach for providing comprehensive care to patients with multimorbidity and clinical complexity. The team of geriatricians, orthopedic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and, in this case, a nephrologist, helped in the careful planning and timing of the single-step surgical repair, decided the appropriate type of anesthesia, and optimized outcomes. After a prompt evaluation of the patient, the OGU approach can achieve clinical stabilization prior to intervention. Along with a strict follow-up in the postoperative phase, this could result in a significant reduction of complications and mortality rates and an early start to a tailored rehabilitation process. We strongly suggest employing facilities with multidisciplinary teams for cases involving complex patients at short-term high risk for poor clinical outcomes. Indeed, the usual single-specialist model of care is gradually being abandoned worldwide.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of physical functioning and encouragement of physical activity in management of the patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), implementation has been undermined by a lack of understanding of the evidence for this recommendation. The purpose of this review is to present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic cohorts that report associations between low levels of physical functioning and/or low physical activity and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD. RECENT FINDINGS: Low levels of physical activity and poor physical functioning are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical outcomes in adult patients with CKD, regardless of treatment modality. Low physical performance and activity limitations are more prevalent in patients with CKD, regardless of age, compared to older community-dwelling adults. SUMMARY: The strength of the evidence presented should strongly motivate a focus of treatment on assessing and improving physical activity and physical function as part of routine patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical activity interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that is similar to or higher than the general population of elderly adults; physical activity, physical function, and performance are strongly associated with all-cause mortality; and exercise training and exercise counseling have been shown to improve measures of physical functioning.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - This paper presents an extension of the joint modeling strategy for the case of multiple longitudinal outcomes and repeated infections of different types over time, motivated by postkidney transplantation data. Our model comprises two parts linked by shared latent terms. On the one hand is a multivariate mixed linear model with random effects, where a low-rank thin-plate spline function is incorporated to collect the nonlinear behavior of the different profiles over time. On the other hand is an infection-specific Cox model, where the dependence between different types of infections and the related times of infection is through a random effect associated with each infection type to catch the within dependence and a shared frailty parameter to capture the dependence between infection types. We implemented the parameterization used in joint models which uses the fitted longitudinal measurements as time-dependent covariates in a relative risk model. Our proposed model was implemented in OpenBUGS using the MCMC approach.

N2  - With the wider availability of antiretrovirals, the world's HIV
population is aging. More than 10% of the 34.5 million HIV-positive
individuals worldwide are over the age of 50 years and the average age
continues to increase. In the USA more than 50% of the 1.3 million
people with HIV are over 50 years old and by the year 2030 it is
estimated that 70% will be over the age of 50 years. Although the life
expectancy of HIV-positive people has increased dramatically, it still
lags behind that of HIV-negative individuals. There is controversy about
whether HIV itself accelerates the aging process. Elevated rates of
inflammation seen in people with HIV, even if their viral loads are
suppressed and their CD4 counts are preserved, are associated with
greater rates of cardiovascular, renal, neurocognitive, oncological, and
osteoporotic disease. These conditions increase exponentially in the
elderly and will represent a major challenge for HIV patients. In
addition, conditions such as geriatric syndromes including frailty are
also seen at higher rates. Management of the aging HIV patient includes
an emphasis on early diagnosis and treatment, preventative measures for
co-morbidities, and avoiding polypharmacy. Finally, the issue of quality
of life, prioritization of medical issues, and end of life care become
increasingly important as the patient grows older. (C) 2016 The

N2  - In a recent study of transplant outcomes, donor age, cerebrovascular
accident as the cause of death (CVA), renal insufficiency (serum
creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL), and history of hypertension have been
identified as donor factors associated with elevated risk of kidney
transplant failure. It is of great interest to know whether there remain
other unmeasured donor factors associated with elevated risk of graft
failure. In this article we study a sample of 6,024 deceased donor
kidney transplants performed in 194 centers from 1995 to 2000. In
addition to variation among transplant recipients, there are two other
random effects: unmeasured donor and unrecorded center factors (data not
available at the physician level). These two random effects are crossed,
because the two kidneys from the same donor can be transplanted in
different centers. Multivariate frailty models are applied to analyze
the data. The likelihood functions of both parametric (e.g., with
piecewise constant baseline hazard) and semiparametric multivariate
frailty models are shown to be proportional to the likelihood functions
of a class of mixed Poisson regression models. The penalized
quasi-likelihood method is used as the numerical procedure for these
mixed Poisson regression models. Thus we are able to estimate and model
crossed random-effects structures for survival analysis. Although about
30% of recipient graft survival rate variation due to donor factors is
explained by the measured donor characteristics, the remaining variation
among donors in graft survival rate is still statistically significant,
suggesting that there may be other unmeasured donor factors associated
with a reduced graft survival rate. We also find significant variation
of graft failure rates among transplant centers due to unrecorded center
factors. Therefore, this study suggests that practice patterns at
transplant centers and identification of other donor factors may merit
further investigation.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Dysregulation of skeletal remodeling is a component of renal osteodystrophy. Previously, we showed that activin receptor signaling is differentially affected in various tissues in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether a ligand trap for the activin receptor type 2A (RAP-011) is an effective treatment of the osteodystrophy of the CKD-mineral bone disorder. With a 70% reduction in the glomerular filtration rate, CKD was induced at 14 weeks of age in the ldlr-/- high fat-fed mouse model of atherosclerotic vascular calcification and diabetes. Twenty mice with CKD, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated activin A were treated with RAP-011, wherease 19 mice were given vehicle twice weekly from week 22 until the mice were killed at 28 weeks of age. The animals were then evaluated by skeletal histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography, mechanical strength testing, and ex vivo bone cell culture. Results in the CKD groups were compared with those of the 16 sham-operated ldlr-/- high fat-fed mice. Sham-operated mice had low-turnover osteodystrophy and skeletal frailty. CKD stimulated bone remodeling with significant increases in osteoclast and osteoblast numbers and bone resorption. Compared with mice with CKD and sham-operated mice, RAP-011 treatment eliminated the CKD-induced increase in these histomorphometric parameters and increased trabecular bone fraction. RAP-011 significantly increased cortical bone area and thickness. Activin A-enhanced osteoclastogenesis was mediated through p-Smad2 association with c-fos and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Thus, an ActRIIA ligand trap reversed CKD-stimulated bone remodeling, likely through inhibition of activin-A induced osteoclastogenesis.

N2  - Coronary artery disease has a significantly higher prevalence in chronic dialysis patients compared to the general population, explained by a cluster of non-specific and specific (uremia-associated) cardiovascular risk factors, typical for these patients. Nephrologists and cardiovascular surgeons worldwide are rather reluctant to offer CABG to dialysis patients, because of concerns about higher risks associated with this procedure in this frail population. However, there is an increasing opinion supporting a more aggressive management of coronary artery disease in uremic individuals. To illustrate this "positive attitude", we report here the first dialysis patient ever treated by CABG in Iasi; his good outcome was both rewarding and encouraging for us all.

N2  - Background: Elderly patients comprise the fastest growing population
initiating dialysis in United States. The impact of poor functional
status and pre-dialysis health status on clinical outcomes in elderly
dialysis patients is not well studied.
Methods: We studied a retrospective cohort of 49,645 incident end stage
renal disease patients that initiated dialysis between January 1, 2008
and December 31, 2008 from the United States Renal Data System with
linked Medicare data covering at least 2 years prior to dialysis
initiation. Using logistic regression models adjusted for pre-dialysis
health status and other cofounders, we examined the impact of poor
functional status as defined from form 2728 on 1-year all-cause
mortality as primary outcome, type of dialysis modality (hemodialysis
vs. peritoneal dialysis), and type of initial vascular access
(arteriovenous access vs. central venous catheter) among hemodialysis
patients as secondary outcomes.
Results: Mean age was 72 +/- 11 years. At dialysis initiation, 18.7%
reported poor functional status, 88.9% had at least 1 pre-dialysis
hospitalization, and 27.8% did not receive pre-dialysis nephrology
care. In adjusted analyses, 1-year mortality was higher in patients with
poor functional status (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.40-1.57). Adjusted odds of
being initiated on hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis (odds ratio
{[}OR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.16-1.66) were higher in
patients with poor functional status. Poor functional status decreased
the adjusted odds of starting hemodialysis with arteriovenous access as
compared to central venous catheter (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.86).
Conclusion: Poor functional status in elderly patients with end stage
renal disease is associated with higher odds of initiating hemodialysis;
increases the risk of central venous catheter use, and is an independent
predictor of 1-year mortality.

N2  - The prevalence of end-stage renal disease is rising in the United States, which bears high financial and public health burden. The most common modality of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the United States is in-center hemodialysis. Many patients report lack of comprehensive and timely education about their treatment options, which may preclude them from participating in home-based dialysis therapies and kidney transplantation evaluation. While RRT education has traditionally been provided in-person, the rise of telehealth has afforded new opportunities to improve upon the status quo. For example, technology-augmented RRT education has recently been implemented into telehealth nephrology clinics, informational websites and mobile applications maintained by professional organizations, patient-driven forums on social media, and multimodality programs. The benefits of technology in RRT education are increased access for geographically isolated and/or medically frail patients, versatility of content delivery, information repetition to enhance knowledge retention, and interpersonal connection for educational content and emotional support. Challenges center around privacy and accuracy of information sharing, in addition to differential access to technology due to age and socioeconomic status. A review of available scholarly and social media resources suggests that technology-aided delivery of education about treatment options for end-stage renal disease provides an important alternative and/or supplemental resource for patients and families.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism in elderly fragile patients presents clinical difficulties due to severity of symptoms and related comorbidity. The optimal surgical approach for this group of patients is still debated. AIM: The aim of the study was to define the optimal technique of parathyroidectomy in elderly patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. METHODS: Retrospective analysis in a series of 253 patients including 35 elderly individuals at a single institution was carried out. Postoperative parathyroid hormone decrease, surgical complications and symptoms control were analyzed for all patients in relation to the types of parathyroidectomy performed. RESULTS: In elderly patients, total parathyroidectomy was the most used approach. Subtotal parathyroidectomy was mostly reserved for younger patients suitable for kidney transplantation. No elderly patients treated with total parathyroidectomy were autotransplanted. No significant difference in surgical complications was observed between younger and elderly patients and considering the different procedures. Adequate symptom control after surgery was achieved in almost 90% of patients. A limited rate of recurrence requiring repeat surgery was observed only after subtotal parathyroidectomy. DISCUSSION: Considering the features of all types of parathyroidectomy, very low recurrence rate, contained postoperative hypocalcemia and limited complications following total parathyroidectomy, might represent specific advantages for elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: Total parathyroidectomy without parathyroid transplantation is safe for elderly patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and a good alternative to the well-established total parathyroidectomy with autografting.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the End-Stage Kidney Disease population has increased and is ever more frail, elderly and co-morbid. A care-focused approach needs to be incorporated alongside the disease focus, to identify those who are deteriorating and improve communication about preferences and future care. Yet many renal professionals feel unprepared for such discussions. AIM: To develop and pilot a REnal specific Advanced Communication Training (REACT) programme to address the needs of End-Stage Kidney Disease patients and renal professionals. DESIGN: Two-part study: (1) development of the REnal specific Advanced Communication Training programme informed by multi-professional focus group and patient survey and (2) piloting of the programme. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: The REnal specific Advanced Communication Training programme was piloted with 16 participants (9 renal nurses/health-care assistants and 7 renal consultants) in two UK teaching hospitals. RESULTS: The focus group identified the need for better information about end-of-life phase, improved awareness of patient perspectives, skills to manage challenging discussions, 'hands on' practice in a safe environment and follow-up to discuss experiences. The patient survey demonstrated a need to improve communication about concerns, treatment plans and decisions. The developed REnal specific Advanced Communication Training programme was acceptable and feasible and was associated with a non-significant increase in confidence in communicating about end-of-life issues (pre-training: 6.6/10, 95% confidence interval: 5.7-7.4; post-training: 6.9/10, 95% confidence interval: 6.1-7.7, unpaired t-test - p = 0.56), maintained at 3 months. CONCLUSION: There is a need to improve end-of-life care for End-Stage Kidney Disease patients, to enable them to make informed decisions about future care. Challenges include prioritising communication training among service providers.

N1  - did not measure frailty in patients with CKD
N2  - BACKGROUND: Hospital use near the end of life is often undesirable to patients, represents considerable Medicare cost, and varies widely across regions. OBJECTIVE: To concurrently examine regional and patient factors, including disability and functional decline, associated with end-of-life hospital use. DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: We sampled decedents aged 65 and older (n = 2,493) from the Health and Retirement Study (2000-2006), and linked data from individual Medicare claims and the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. Two-part regression models estimated the relationship between total hospital days in the last 6 months and patient characteristics including physical function, while adjusting for regional resources and hospital care intensity (HCI). KEY RESULTS: Median hospital days was 7 (range = 0-183). 53% of respondents had functional decline. Compared with decedents without functional decline, those with severe disability or decline had more regression-adjusted hospital days (range 3.47-9.05, depending on category). Dementia was associated with fewer days (-3.02); while chronic kidney disease (2.37), diabetes (2.40), stroke or transient ischemic attack (2.11), and congestive heart failure (1.74) were associated with more days. African Americans and Hispanics had more days (5.91 and 4.61, respectively). Those with family nearby had 1.62 fewer days and hospice enrollees had 1.88 fewer days. Additional hospital days were associated with urban residence (1.74) and residence in a region with more specialists (1.97) and higher HCI (2.27). CONCLUSIONS: Functional decline is significantly associated with end-of-life hospital use among older adults. To improve care and reduce costs, health care programs and policies should address specific needs of patients with functional decline and disability.

self-reported frailty was associated with a higher risk of falls or fractures requiring medical attention (hazards ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.16-2.20).
N2  - BACKGROUND: Although frailty has been linked to higher risk of falls and fracture in the general population, only few studies have examined the extent to which frailty is associated with these outcomes among patients with end-stage renal disease, who are at particularly high risk for these events. METHODS: A total of 1,646 patients who were beginning maintenance hemodialysis in 297 dialysis units throughout the United States from September 2005 to June 2007 were enrolled in the Comprehensive Dialysis Study, and 1,053 Medicare beneficiaries were included in this study. Self-reported frailty was defined by the patients endorsing 2 or more of the following: poor physical functioning, exhaustion or low physical activity. Falls and fractures requiring medical attention were identified through Medicare claims data. We examined the association between frailty and the time to first fall or fracture using the Fine-Gray modification of Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for demographics, Quetelet's body mass index, diabetes mellitus, heart failure and atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of patients were frail by self-report. The median length of follow-up was 2.5 (1.0-3.9) years. Crude rates of first medically urgent falls or fractures were 66 and 126 per 1,000 person-years in non-frail and self-reported frail participants, respectively. After accounting for demographic factors, comorbidities and the competing risk of death, self-reported frailty was associated with a higher risk of falls or fractures requiring medical attention (hazards ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.16-2.20). CONCLUSION: Participants reporting frailty experienced nearly twice the risk of medically urgent falls or fractures compared to those who did not report frailty.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - For many reasons patients on hemodialysis treatment have a low physical capacity. In this study the physical capacity was tested in 41 patients with chronic renal failure during their first weeks on hemodialysis and after 18 months of treatment. Compared to reference values the test result showed a significantly decreased physical strength, endurance and balance capacity already at the start of the dialysis. The patients were tested and got individually tailored information at the kidney unit and received some physical training outside the hospital. After 18 months the result for the group was not improved in spite of the fact that the 11 most frail patients had died. Diabetic and elderly patients had a significantly lower result than the rest of the patients. Future research will show, if more regular exercise (predialytic) individually programmed by a specially trained physiotherapist who can obtain up-to-date medical information as working in close contact to a dialysis unit, will further improve the condition of these patients.

N2  - Background: Frailty increases the risk of disability, long-term care and hospitalisations in the elderly and is recognised as an important challenge to improving healthy ageing. While frailty is known to be associated with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), risk factors underlying these associations remain unclear. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of frailty and investigate lifestyle, social and cardio-metabolic risk factors associated with frailty.Methods: Data come from a socially representative sample of 1622 men from 24 British towns aged 71-92 between 2010 and 2012. Frailty assessment was based on the Fried phenotype comprising weight loss, grip strength, exhaustion, slowness and low physical activity.Results: Among 1622 men, 19% were frail and 54% were pre-frail. Compared to non-frail men, those with frailty had a higher odds of obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2; odds ratio (OR) 2.03, 95%CI 1.38–2.99)), high waist circumference (≥102 cm; OR 2.30, 95%CI 1.67–3.17), and having low social network (OR 2.16; 95%CI 1.46–3.17). Frail individuals also had significantly higher odds of chronic conditions including CVD, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, anaemia, asthma, bronchitis, arthritis, falls, cataract and depression. Frail individuals had a worse cardio-metabolic profile with increased risk of dyslipidemia, increased heart rate, poor lung function (FEV1), raised white cell count, poor renal function (high creatinine, low estimated glomerular filtration rate), low alanine transaminase (ALT), and low serum sodium; some risk factors were also associated with being pre-frail. These associations remained in men without CVD.Conclusions: A range of social and cardiometabolic risk factors were associated with frailty, which highlights the burden of metabolic abnormalities in frail elderly individuals. Characterising and managing the social and metabolic profile is important to manage the high risk of cardiovascular disease in frail elderly individuals.

N2  - The majority of countries have enacted edicts to regulate organ transplantation due to mounting recognition of its intricacies and increasing level of global disquiet. Frail national economy and status of health care infrastructure restricts access of the local population to both dialysis and transplantation in Pakistan. There is a surge in kidney transplantation activities, however. I have reported the enormity of organ crime in Pakistan. The number of commercial renal transplants range from 3000 to 4500. Foreign nationals share the marketplace. There are current attempts from the government to stop organ trade by strictly enforcing a recently sanctioned law on organ transplantation. Scarcity of comprehensive reliable data has hampered plausible assessments and indispensable modifications to facilitate designs for the future health care. Alternatives to organ transplantation will augment the choice of treatment modalities for a proliferating end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. The whole array of existing therapeutic modalities for ESRD has to be utilized. Promoting a fresh culture of organ donation by strengthening of the family institution may be another objective.

N1  - did not measure frailty in the study population

N2  - BACKGROUND: The modified frailty index (mFI) has been shown to predict adverse outcomes in multiple nonorthopedic surgical specialties. This study aimed to assess whether mFI is a predictor of adverse events in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Patients who underwent THA and TKA from 2005-2012 were identified in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. mFI was calculated for each patient using 15 variables found in National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Bivariate and multivariate analyses of postoperative adverse events, including Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications, were performed. RESULTS: A total of 14,583 THA and 25,223 TKA patients were included for analysis. The mean (standard deviation, range) mFIs were 0.083 (0.080, 0-0.55) for THA and 0.097 (0.080, 0-0.64) for TKA cohorts. On bivariate analyses, incidence of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, septic shock, pulmonary embolism, postoperative dialysis, reintubation, and prolonged ventilator requirement), hospital-acquired conditions (surgical site infection, venous thromboembolism, and urinary tract infection), any complications, and mortality increased significantly with increase in mFI (P < .0001 for all). Adjusting for demographics, age >/= 75, body mass index >/=40, American Society of Anesthesiologists class >/=4, and nonclean wound status, mFI >/=0.45 was shown to be the strongest independent predictor of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications for both THA and TKA cohorts with odds ratios of 5.140 and 4.183, respectively. CONCLUSION: mFI >/=0.45 is an independent predictor of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications in TKA/THA patients with greater odds ratios than age >75, body mass index >/=40, American Society of Anesthesiologists class >/=4. mFI should be considered for risk stratifying joint arthroplasty patients preoperatively and perhaps determining immediate postoperative destination.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Background: Hospitalizations of chronic dialysis patients have not been previously studied at a national level in Canada. Understanding the scope and variables associated with hospitalizations will inform measures for improvement. Objective: To describe the risk of all-cause and infection-related hospitalizations in patients on dialysis. Design: Retrospective cohort study using health care administrative databases. Setting: Provinces and territories across Canada (excluding Manitoba and Quebec). Patients: Incident chronic dialysis patients with a dialysis start date between January 1, 2005, and March 31, 2014. Patients with a prior history of kidney transplantation were excluded. Measurements: Patient characteristics were recorded at baseline. Dialysis modality was treated as a time-varying covariate. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause and dialysis-specific infection-related hospitalizations. Methods: Crude rates for all-cause hospitalization and infection-related hospitalization were determined per patient year (PPY) at 7 and 30 days, and at 3, 6, and 12 months postdialysis initiation. A stratified, gamma-distributed frailty model was used to assess repeat hospital admissions and to determine the inter-recurrence dependence of hospitalizations within individuals, as well as the hazard ratio (HR) attributed to each covariate of interest. Results: A total of 38 369 incident chronic dialysis patients were included: 38 088 adults and 281 pediatric patients (age less than 18 years). There were 112 374 hospitalizations, of which 11.5% were infection-related hospitalizations. The all-cause hospitalization rate was similar for all adult age groups (age 65 years and older: 1.40, 1.35, and 1.18 admissions PPY at 7 days, 30 days, and 6 months, respectively). The all-cause hospitalization rate was higher for pediatric patients (1.67, 2.48, and 2.47 admissions PPY at 7 days, 30 days, and 6 months, respectively; adjusted HR: 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.37-3.15, referent age group: 45-64 years). Within the first 7 days after dialysis initiation, patients on peritoneal dialysis had a higher risk of all-cause hospitalization (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.07-1.50) and infection-related hospitalization (HR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.19-3.55) compared with patients on hemodialysis. Beyond 7 days, the risk did not differ significantly by dialysis modality. Female sex and Indigenous race were significant risk factors for all-cause hospitalization. Limitations: The cohort had too few home hemodialysis patients to examine this subgroup. The outcome of infection-related hospitalization was determined using diagnostic codes. Dialysis patients from Manitoba and Quebec were not included. Conclusions: In Canada, the rates of hospitalization were not influenced by dialysis modality beyond the initial 7-day period following dialysis initiation; however, the rate of hospitalization in pediatric patients was higher than in adults at every time frame examined.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: In elderly patients, especially those older than 80 years, atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an almost 25% increased risk of stroke. Stroke prophylaxis with anticoagulants is therefore highly recommended. The prevalence of factors that have been associated with a lower rate of prescription and adherence to anticoagulant therapy in these patients is little known. The objective of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics of elderly subjects, with and without AF, consecutively admitted to an acute geriatric unit, discussing factors that may decrease the persistence on stroke prophylaxis therapy. We also highlight possible strategies to overcome the barriers conditioning the current underuse of oral anticoagulants in this segment of the population. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed on a cohort of elderly patients with and without AF admitted to the Acute Geriatric Unit of San Gerardo Hospital (Monza, Italy). RESULTS: Compared to patients without AF (n = 1216), those with AF (n = 403) had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (3 vs. 2, P < 0.001), number of administered drugs (4 vs. 3, P < 0.001), rate of heart failure (36.5% vs. 12%, P < 0.001) and chronic kidney disease (20.6 vs. 13.2, P < 0.001). Many patients with AF were frail (54%) or pre-frail (29%). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with AF have higher rates of conditions that affect adherence to traditional anticoagulant therapy (vitamin K antagonists, VKA). New direct oral anticoagulants (DOAs) can help overcome this problem. In order to prescribe the most appropriate VKA or DOAs, with the best efficacy/safety profile and the highest compliance, a comprehensive geriatric assessment should always accompany the scores for thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk stratification.

N2  - AIM: A recent, growing concern regarding haemodialysis in Japan is a sustained increase in the elderly population. Among very elderly people who start haemodialysis, the prognosis is considered to be poor; however, this has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to discover the short-term prognosis and related factors in very elderly patients who commence haemodialysis. METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2013, 122 patients aged >/=85 years at haemodialysis initiation were documented in our hospital. Predictors of 90-day and 1-year mortality after haemodialysis initiation were assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Selection of covariates for the multivariate model was based on forward stepwise selection using the probability of a likelihood ratio statistics. RESULTS: The subjects' mean age was 87.4 +/- 2.5 years, and 48% were female. The most common cause of death was infection (38% of patients) and the leading cause of infectious death was pneumonia. The 90-day and 1-year survival rates were 81% and 62%, respectively. Suboptimal initiation was a significant prognostic factor for 90-day [hazard ratio (HR) 3.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-13.43] and 1-year [HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.51-6.76] mortality after adjusting for confounders in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Very elderly patients who started haemodialysis had a poor prognosis, and suboptimal initiation significantly predicted outcome. Shared decision-making with patients and their families is needed for initiating haemodialysis on the conditions that appropriate information on the expected prognosis is provided.

N2  - Kidney cancers account for 2-3% of all adult malignancies in the UK. Men are predominantly affected by renal cancer with an average age at diagnosis of 64 years. Renal (or clear) cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 90% of kidney cancers. Early diagnosis improves survival with five-year survival rates for renal cancer of 70-94% for localised tumours in the UK. RCC should be suspected in the presence of localising symptoms such as flank pain, a loin mass or haematuria; constitutional upset including weight loss, pyrexia and/or night sweats; or with unexplained laboratory tests. Smoking, obesity and hypertension are the most important and most common risk factors. Environmental exposure to asbestos, cadmium and trichloroethylene are less common risk factors. Patients on chronic dialysis and renal transplant recipients are at increased risk of RCC in their native kidneys. If kidney cancer is suspected on history, physical examination or initial screening tests then a red flag ultrasound examination of the renal tracts should be requested. Dipstick urinalysis is of great value as asymptomatic haematuria may be the only abnormal test in the presence of non-specific symptoms such as weight loss or loin pain. Visible or non-visible haematuria, in the absence of proteinuria, suggests an underlying structural abnormality is present in the kidneys, ureters or bladder. Surgical removal of RCCs, where feasible, may result in cure in up to 40-60% of cases. Individuals too frail for major surgery may benefit from thermal ablation and cryotherapy. Agents that target the VEGF and mTOR pathways are considered first line in the treatment of metastatic RCC. Sunitinib, recommended by NICE, is administered orally and acts by inhibiting the VEGF receptor.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frail and polypathological patients (PP) are often undertreated with  evidence-based cardiovascular drugs, as their benefits are uncertain in this population. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers/inhibitors (ACEI/ARB), statins and/or beta-blockers on survival rates and functional decline in PP with evidence-based clinical indications for treatment with any of these drug families. METHOD: Prospective observational multicentre cohort study with a 12-month follow-up period. We selected PP with any condition of the following: chronic heart failure, coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus with any visceral involvement, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. Clinical, functional (Barthel index), socio-familial risk data and drug prescriptions were measured at baseline. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models were used to identify variables independently associated with survival and functional decline. RESULTS: The analysis included 1260 PP. The mean age was 79+/-9.5 years. The mortality rate was 34.5%. Statin (aHR 0.671; P=0.001), beta-blocker plus statin (aHR 0.645; P=0.007), ACEI/ARB plus statin (aHR 0.680; P=0.002), or combined ACEI/ARB plus statin plus beta-blocker (aHR 0.541; P=0.000) prescriptions were associated with longer survival times. Additionally, PP whose Barthel index was >/=60 showed a lower risk of disability progression if treated with statins (aOR=0.476; P=0.000), or their combinations, mainly with ACEI/ARB plus beta-blockers (aOR 0.563; P=0.031). CONCLUSIONS: The prescription of statins, alone or in combination with other drugs, may impact the survival and functional decline in polypathological patients. Further prospective blinded randomised assays are needed to confirm these observations.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - INTRODUCTION: As the average age of haemodialysis patients rapidly increases around the world, the number of frail, elderly patients has increased. Frailty is well known to be an indicator of disability and a poor prognosis for haemodialysis patients. Exercise interventions have been safely and successfully implemented for middle-aged or younger patients undergoing haemodialysis. However, the benefits of exercise interventions on elderly patients undergoing haemodialysis remain controversial. The main objective of this study is to systematically review the effects of exercise training on the physical function, exercise capacity and quality of life of elderly patients undergoing haemodialysis, and to provide an update on the relevant evidence. METHODS AND ANALYSES: Published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the effectiveness of exercise training on haemodialysis patients with respect to physical function, exercise tolerance and quality of life will be included. Bibliographic databases include MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO and PEDro. The risk of bias of the included RCTs will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and TESTEX. The primary outcome will be physical function and exercise tolerance. This review protocol is reported according to the PRISMA-P 2015 checklist. Statistical analysis will be performed using review manager software (RevMan V.5.3, Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required because this study does not include confidential personal data nor does it perform interventions on patients. This review is expected to inform readers on the effectiveness of exercise training in elderly patients undergoing haemodialysis. Findings will be presented at conferences and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42015020701.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - BACKGROUND: The accuracy of prediction equations has not been validated in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 4‐5 in extreme situations of nutritional status and age. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The significance of nutritional status, calculated with the creatinine production (CP) formula, and age (< or =64 years and >64 years) in the application of different prediction equations‐‐modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD), simplified MDRD (sMDRD), Cockcroft‐Gault (CG)‐‐and the mean of urea and creatinine clearance (Cr‐Ur) compared with the isotopic glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation calculated by 51Cr‐EDTA was studied in 87 Caucasian adults with CKD stages 4‐5 (GFR: 30‐8 ml/min/1.73 m2). The Bland‐Altman method and Lin's concordance coefficient (Rc) were used to study accuracy (bias) and precision. RESULTS: The GFR calculated with 51Cr‐EDTA in the study group was 22.2 +/‐ 6.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 (range: 8‐30). CG and sMDRD were the best prediction equations with bias of ‐1.1 and ‐3.8 ml/min/1.73 m2 and Rc of 0.52‐0.50. In this situation, the mean Cr‐Ur proved the most inaccurate equation compared with the isotopic technique with bias of ‐5.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 and Rc of 0.32. In the analysis of patients with higher CP (> 0.90; n = 44), CG and sMDRD obtained the best bias of 1.2 and ‐2.7 ml/min/1.73 m2 and Rc of 0.54‐0.53. In patients aged < or =64 (n = 44), these equations obtained a bias of 1.1 and ‐3.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 and Rc 0.50‐0.49. Both in lower CP (< or =0.90; n = 43) and older age (>64 years; n = 43), all the equations underestimated the value obtained with isotopic GFR. In these situations, the results obtained with CG had a bias of ‐2.2 and ‐3.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 (Rc 0.29‐0.56) and with sMDRD ‐4.0 and ‐4.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 (Rc 0.39‐0.51). In these circumstances, Cr‐Ur was the most inaccurate equation, obtaining a bias of ‐10.1 and ‐13.2 ml/min/1.73 m2 (Rc 0.14‐0.16). CONCLUSIONS: In the group with higher CP and age < or =64 years, results of the presented data yielded no evidence for superiority of the MDRD equation over CG formula in patients with advanced renal failure. On the basis of our results, we do not recommend the use of the Cr‐Ur adjusted to 1.73 m(2) of body surface area, which was the most imprecise equation. Application of all the equations proved inaccurate in lower CP patients with or without advanced age, implying the premature start of substitution renal treatment. In these circumstances, ambulatory GFR determination by isotopic techniques would be indicated.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The number of elderly patients with end stage renal disease is constantly increasing. Conventional hamodiaylsis as the mainstay of renal replacement therapy is often poorly tolerated by frail eldery patients with multiple comorbidities. Although many of these patients would prefer a home based dialysis treatment, the number of elderly patients using peritoneal dialysis (PD) is still low. Impaired physical and cognitive function often generates insurmountable barriers for self care peritoneal dialysis. Assisted peritoneal dialysis can overcome many of these barriers and give elderly patients the ability of a renal replacement therapy in their own homes respecting their needs.

care in hemodialysis patients. However, there is no clear evidence to
support these recommendations. We investigated whether the proportion of
attendance at a regular program for management of physical activity and
physical function can predict all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
events in hemodialysis patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort
study consisted of 266 hemodialysis patients participating in the
management program at least once. Participants were tracked for 3 years
after their first attendance at the management program to determine
their attendance proportion. The main study outcomes included all-cause
mortality and a composite of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events.
Results: Median patient age was 64.5 (interquartile range, 56.8 72.0)
years, 45% were women, and the median time on hemodialysis was 35.5
(interquartile range, 12.0 114.3) months at baseline. Sixty-five
patients died over a median follow-up of 79 months. The incidence of
cardiovascular events was 60 over a median follow-up of 68 months. Even
after adjusting for any of the prognostic models, participants who
attended <= 75% of sessions (n = 140) had higher risks of mortality
(hazard ratio (HR), 1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00 3.36; P =
0.049) and cardiovascular events (HR, 1.84; 95% CI: 1.07 3.48; P =
0.03) than those attending > 75% of sessions (n = 126). Conclusion:
Hemodialysis patients in whom physical activity and physical function
could be assessed more regularly had better prognosis than those with
only intermittent assessment. (C) 2018 The Author(s) Published by S.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - As a result of the changing dialysis demographics, nephrologists are increasingly faced with problems traditionally considered to be geriatric issues. The specialty of nephrology has often been seen as using intensive, expensive, and complex technologies for patient care. Dialysis programs have evolved into highly efficient, fast-paced units that accommodate a rapid turnover of patients. They are in direct contrast to geriatric programs, which use geriatric principles to offer simple, multidimensional, holistic care to frail older patients. Finding the balance between nephrology and geriatric skill sets is a particular challenge for up-and-coming nephrologists who have an interest in geriatric nephrology. This mini-review addresses some of the challenges, increases awareness of specific issues, and highlights new opportunities in this field.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - Patients treated with dialysis have low levels of physical functioning and activity. Whether this translates into frailty or not may depend on how the frailty phenotype is operationalized. This is a secondary analysis of data from the Renal Exercise Demonstration Project to evaluate two methods of operationalizing the Fried phenotype for frailty: Using measured walking speed and muscle weakness (FRAILmeas) and using substitution of the Physical Function Scale (PF) from the SF-36 questionnaire for walking speed and muscle weakness (FRAILsubst). Complete data for both measures were available for 188 hemodialysis patients. The frailty score (FRAILmeas) was the sum of criteria scores for measured gait speed, chair stand, body mass index, vitality, and physical activity. The frailty score (FRAILsubst) substituted the PF scale score (<75) as a surrogate measure for gait speed and for weakness. The frailty score ranged from 0 to 5. Scores >/=3 were categorized as frail, and <3 as not frail. The substitution of the PF score for walking speed and muscle weakness resulted in 78% of patients being categorized as frail compared to 24% using actual measured walking speed and muscle weakness (P < .001). The component of frailty that had the highest prevalence was low physical activity (average 54% of subjects). Frailty (using the FRAILmeas) was higher in patients with increasing age, female gender, and lower self-reported PF. Frailty is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients; however, measured constructs of the components of frailty should be used to report the frailty phenotype.

N2  - Recommendations for the management of hypertension in the elderly are
largely consistent with the exception of the 2013 Joint National
Committee (JNC) 8 guidelines that recommend lowering systolic blood
pressure (SBP) in persons aged >= 60 years to <150 mmHg if they do not
have diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. In contrast, I concur
with the minority view from JNC 8 which recommends a SBP goal in these
persons aged 60 to 79 years of <140 mmHg. This view is consistent with
the 2011 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
(ACC/AHA) guidelines that also recommend a SBP goal of 140 to 145 mmHg
if tolerated in adults aged = 80 years. ACC/AHA consensus guidelines use
the totality of evidence in addition to randomized controlled trial
data. These guidelines are also consistent with treatment
recommendations from numerous other societies that recommend SBP goals
of <140 mmHg in persons aged 60 to 79 years and <150 mmHg in persons
aged >= 80 years. Hypertension is currently under-treated in the
elderly, and relaxation of ACC/AHA guidelines by JNC 8 will result in
substantially more cardiovascular events. Randomized clinical trial
studies on treatment of essential hypertension or secondary hypertension
in frail elderly persons have not been performed.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To update the evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of hypertension in adults for 2010. OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES: For lifestyle and pharmacological interventions, randomized trials and systematic reviews of trials were preferentially reviewed. Changes in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes of interest. However, for lifestyle interventions, blood pressure lowering was accepted as a primary outcome given the general lack of long-term morbidity and mortality data in this field. Progressive renal impairment was also accepted as a clinically relevant primary outcome among patients with chronic kidney disease. EVIDENCE: A Cochrane Collaboration librarian conducted an independent MEDLINE search from 2008 to August 2009 to update the 2009 recommendations. To identify additional studies, reference lists were reviewed and experts were contacted. All relevant articles were reviewed and appraised independently by both content and methodological experts using prespecified levels of evidence. RECOMMENDATIONS: For lifestyle modifications to prevent and treat hypertension, restrict dietary sodium to 1500 mg (65 mmol) per day in adults 50 years of age or younger, to 1300 mg (57 mmol) per day in adults 51 to 70 years of age, and to 1200 mg (52 mmol) per day in adults older than 70 years of age; perform 30 min to 60 min of moderate aerobic exercise four to seven days per week; maintain a healthy body weight (body mass index 18.5 kg/m(2) to 24.9 kg/m(2)) and waist circumference (less than 102 cm for men and less than 88 cm for women); limit alcohol consumption to no more than 14 standard drinks per week for men or nine standard drinks per week for women; follow a diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fibre, whole grains and protein from plant sources, and that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol; and consider stress management in selected individuals with hypertension. For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on the patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to less than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered in all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in elderly patients who are frail). For adults without compelling indications for other agents, considerations for initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics, angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in patients who are not black), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered as initial treatment of hypertension if systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above target or if diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above target. The combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used, unless compelling indications are present to suggest consideration of dual therapy. Agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include thiazide diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with coronary artery disease, ACE inhibitors, ARBs or betablockers are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. In selected high-risk patients in whom combination therapy is being considered, an ACE inhibitor plus a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB is preferable to an ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian lipid treatment guidelines. Selected patients with hypertension who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy, but who are otherwise at high risk for cardiovascular events, should nonetheless receive statin therapy. Once blood pressure is controlled, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered. VALIDATION: All recommendations were graded according to the strength of the evidence and voted on by the 63 members of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force. All recommendations reported here achieved at least 80% consensus. These guidelines will continue to be updated annually. SPONSORS: The Canadian Hypertension Education Program process is sponsored by the Canadian Hypertension Society, Blood Pressure Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the College of Family Physicians of Canada, the Canadian Pharmacists Association, the Canadian Council of Cardiovascular Nurses, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Dental disease is more extensive in adults with chronic kidney disease, but whether dental health and behaviors are associated with survival in the setting of hemodialysis is unknown. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multinational cohort. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,205 adults treated with long-term hemodialysis, 2010 to 2012 (Oral Diseases in Hemodialysis [ORAL-D] Study). PREDICTORS: Dental health as assessed by a standardized dental examination using World Health Organization guidelines and personal oral care, including edentulousness; decayed, missing, and filled teeth index; teeth brushing and flossing; and dental health consultation. OUTCOMES: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months after dental assessment. MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 22.1 months, 942 deaths occurred, including 477 cardiovascular deaths. Edentulousness (adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.51) and decayed, missing, or filled teeth score >/= 14 (adjusted HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.33-2.17) were associated with early all-cause mortality, while dental flossing, using mouthwash, brushing teeth daily, spending at least 2 minutes on oral hygiene daily, changing a toothbrush at least every 3 months, and visiting a dentist within the past 6 months (adjusted HRs of 0.52 [95% CI, 0.32-0.85], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64-0.97], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58-0.99], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-0.99], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.95], and 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.96], respectively) were associated with better survival. Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar. LIMITATIONS: Convenience sample of clinics. CONCLUSIONS: In adults treated with hemodialysis, poorer dental health was associated with early death, whereas preventive dental health practices were associated with longer survival.

N2  - AIM: To determine the factors that may prolong the length of stay (LOS) for older patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also to see if they are applicable to the younger patients. METHODS: A retrospective case record review was conducted of all adult patients who were discharged from the general medical service or the geriatric medicine service of an acute care hospital over 6 months. RESULTS: During the study period, 393 patients were discharged with the diagnosis of pneumonia. Based on the study criteria, 200 patients were included in the study. Of the elderly patients, 39% had severe pneumonia compared to 9.3% in the younger group (P < 0.001), resulting in a higher mortality rate. All patients with severe pneumonia had serum albumin levels of less than 3.7 g/dL. The median LOS was significantly shorter in the younger patients (4 days) compared to the elderly patients (9 days, P < 0.001). Severe pneumonia, dysphagia, chronic renal disease, hypoalbuminemia and older age group were found to be significantly associated with longer LOS. CONCLUSION: Compared to younger patients, older subjects aged 65 years and above hospitalized with CAP were more likely to have severe pneumonia and longer LOS. Presence of severe pneumonia, dysphagia, chronic renal disease, hypoalbuminaemia and age of more than 65 years were significantly associated with longer LOS for all patients. However, in the younger group, only hypoalbuminaemia remained a significant factor. In the elderly patients, severe pneumonia, dysphagia and type of residence were important factors predicting longer LOS.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - There has been a significant increase in the number of frail older patients diagnosed with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) over the past thirty years. These elderly patients have high levels of comorbidity, and as a consequence the face of renal medicine is changing-There is an increasing need to focus on traditionally geriatric areas of expertise such as falls prevention and rehabilitation, and to shift our emphasis onto improving patient well-being rather than longevity. Over the past decade, many nephrologists have found that they are already acting as de facto "amateur geriatricians". This denies patients both the benefits of specialist geriatric assessment, and equally importantly denies them access to the wider geriatric multidisciplinary team. This article describes the prevalence and underlying causes of the so-called "Geriatric Giants" in patients with advanced CKD, and discusses possible improvements in care that closer working with geriatricians could bring.

Recipients with both depressive symptoms and frailty had a 1.88 times (95% CI: 1.70-2.08, P&lt;0.001) longer LOS, 6.20-fold (95%CI:1.67-22.95, p&lt;0.01) increased risk of DCGF, and 2.62-fold (95%CI:1.03-6.70, p=0.04) increased risk of mortality, compared to those who were nonfrail and without depressive symptoms.
N2  - Depressive symptoms and frailty are each independently associated with morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. We hypothesized that having both depressive symptoms and frailty would be synergistic and worse than the independent effect of each. In a multicenter cohort study of 773 KT recipients, we measured the Fried frailty phenotype and the modified 18-question Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Using adjusted Poisson regression and survival analysis, we tested whether depressive symptoms (CES-D score > 14) and frailty were associated with KT length of stay (LOS), death-censored graft failure (DCGF), and mortality. At KT admission, 10.0% of patients exhibited depressive symptoms, 16.3% were frail, and 3.6% had both. Recipients with depressive symptoms were more likely to be frail (aOR = 3.97, 95% CI: 2.28-6.91, P < 0.001). Recipients with both depressive symptoms and frailty had a 1.88 times (95% CI: 1.70-2.08, P < 0.001) longer LOS, 6.20-fold (95% CI:1.67-22.95, P < 0.01) increased risk of DCGF, and 2.62-fold (95% CI:1.03-6.70, P = 0.04) increased risk of mortality, compared to those who were nonfrail and without depressive symptoms. There was only evidence of synergistic effect of frailty and depressive symptoms on length of stay (P for interaction < 0.001). Interventions aimed at reducing pre-KT depressive symptoms and frailty should be explored for their impact on post-KT outcomes.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease prevalence will continue to rise due to increased life expectancy and population ageing. It is likely that the decline in glomerular filtration rate with increasing age represents a renal manifestation of widespread vascular disease. In addition to its associated cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease in older people is associated with increased prevalence of geriatric syndromes such as functional and cognitive decline, which lead to disability and frailty. Competing risks for mortality, because of the co-existence of multiple co-morbidities in old age, means that the majority of older people with chronic kidney disease will not progress to end-stage renal disease. Management of chronic kidney disease in older people is complex and an individualized and holistic, rather than disease-orientated, approach is necessary, which takes into account patients’ priorities and wishes, especially frail and very elderly populations with multiple co-morbidities.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - The incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide, especially in the elderly. Recently, functional impairment and frailty have been recognized as factors affecting the quality of life, and outcomes in elderly patients with CKD and therapeutic interventions to improve function and reduce frailty are therefore being considered. Growth hormone (GH) levels decrease with age and GH actions are impaired in CKD patients. GH stimulates protein synthesis, bone, and glucose metabolism, and affects body composition by reducing body fat and increasing lean body mass. An increase in lean body mass may reduce frailty and thus avoid functional impairment. Thus, providing GH to elderly CKD patients could potentially improve outcomes and quality of life by lowering the risk of frailty and associated functional impairment. There are few studies assessing the long-term effects of GH administration on symptoms of frailty in elderly patients with CKD. In this review we will try to shed some light on the trials assessing the administration of GH to elderly subjects and to patients with CKD and focus on the possible role GH administration may play to improve frailty and quality of life in those patients.

N2  - Background: The pathogenesis of falling is complex, and identification
of risk factors may be essential for prevention. The relationship
between renal disease and falls is unclear, and the goal of this study
was to collect the available evidence and investigate the relationship
between accidental falls and renal dysfunction.
Methods: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid
SP and Web of Science databases to identify the appropriate literature.
The themes used were: falls (combined in the title/abstract fall or
falls or falling or faller{*} or fallen or slip{*} or trip{*} or (MeSH)
accidental falls) and renal insufficiency (chronic or renal
insufficiency or kidney diseases combined in title/abstract renal
disease{*} or kidney disease{*} or renal insufficiency or kidney
insufficiency or kidney failure or renal failure or MeSH renal
insufficiency, chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases). The
incidence, risk factors, complications, and characteristics of the falls
were analyzed.
Results: Eight prospective cohorts including five cross-sectional
studies, and one case-control study were identified. No randomized
controlled studies were found. The incidence of falls in chronic kidney
disease patients ranged between 1.18 and 1.60 fall/patient year. These
were frequent in frail older adults on hemodialysis treatment. Falling
relapses in the same group of patients caused serious consequences. Data
on pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) were scarce.
Conclusions: The risk of falling appears to be common in patients with
renal dysfunction especially in older adults undergoing hemodialysis. On
the other hand, we could not find any conclusive data on pre-ESRD
patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) in the elderly is a complex condition. It has a direct impact on the underuse of antithrombotic therapy reported in this population. DISCUSSION: All patients aged >/=75 years with AF have an individual yearly risk of stroke >4 %. However, the risk of hemorrhage is also increased. Moreover, in this population it is common the presence of other comorbidities, cognitive disorders, risk of falls and polymedication. This may lead to an underuse of anticoagulant therapy. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are at least as effective as conventional therapy, but with lesser risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The simplification of treatment with these drugs may be an advantage in patients with cognitive impairment. The great majority of elderly patients with AF should receive anticoagulant therapy, unless an unequivocal contraindication. DOACs may be the drugs of choice in many elderly patients with AF. In this manuscript, the available evidence about the management of anticoagulation in elderly patients with AF is reviewed. In addition, specific practical recommendations about different controversial issues (i.e. patients with anemia, thrombocytopenia, risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal dysfunction, cognitive impairment, risk of falls, polymedication, frailty, etc.) are provided.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or who are on dialysis should be able to live as fully and comfortably as possible. Geriatric patients are most interested in outcomes that will optimize mental and physical function and limit suffering and pain. Nephrologists must help them answer the question: "How will my kidney problem affect the way I live now and in the future?" This means management must move beyond glomerular filtration rate-related targets and incorporate geriatric principles that focus on assessment of function, comorbidities, geriatric syndromes, and quality of life issues. Therapeutic decisions should be individualized and directed by patient goals of care, which must be explored and documented. Accomplishing this requires inclusion of the patient's family-support system in the shared decision-making process. There is no substitute for spending time listening to and understanding the patient and family agenda, providing timely medical and prognostic updates; discussing realistic scenarios to balance expectations; and planting the seeds of change as the quantity and quality of medical events, geriatric syndromes, and comorbidities accumulate. Synergy of the interdisciplinary renal team with geriatric and palliative medicine specialists provides the expertise to achieve these goals. This falls into the domain of geriatric renal palliative or supportive care (1) and is the subject of this practical review.

N2  - Although the number of elderly patients requiring dialysis has increased, data regarding the prognosis of elderly patients undergoing hemodialysis are limited. In the present study, prognosis in Japanese hemodialysis patients aged >/=80 years was evaluated. From January 1988 to July 2013, 1144 consecutive patients with end-stage renal disease required renal replacement therapy at our institution; of these, 141 were aged >/=80 years. These patients' charts were retrospectively reviewed for relevant clinical variables and survival time. The life expectancies table from the National Vital Statistics database was used, and prognostic factors were assessed by multivariate analysis. In total, 107 deaths (76%) were recorded during the study period. The median survival time and estimated life-shortening period in the patients were 2.6 years and -5.3 years, respectively. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status and hemoglobin level were revealed as prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. Estimates of prognosis and prognostic factors may provide useful information for physicians as well as elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease.

N2  - Background. Seasonal influenza is responsible for high annual morbidity
and mortality worldwide, especially in elderly patients. The aim of the
study was to analyse the epidemiological, clinical and prognostic
features of influenza in octogenarians and nonagenarians admitted to a
general hospital, as well as risk factors associated with mortality.
Methods. Retrospective, cross-sectional, descriptive study in patients
admitted and diagnosed with influenza by molecular biology in the
General University Hospital of Alicante from 1 January to 31 April 2015.
Results. A total of 219 patients were diagnosed with influenza in the
study period: 55 (25.1%) were <= 64 years-old; 77 (35.2%) were aged
65-79; 67 (30.6%) were aged 80-89 years; and 20 (9.1%) were aged >= 90
years. Most flu episodes were caused by influenza A (n=181, 82.6%).
Patients aged 80 years or older had lower glomerular filtration rate
(mean: 49.7 mL/min vs. 62.2 mL/min; p=0.006), a greater need for
non-invasive mechanical ventilation (22% vs 9.3%; p=0.02), greater
co-morbidity due to cardiac insufficiency (40.5% vs. 16.4%; p<0.001)
and chronic renal disease (32.9 vs. 20%, p=0.03), and greater mortality
(19% vs. 2.9%; p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, mortality was
higher in those aged 80 or over (adjusted odds ratio {[}ORa] 9.2, 95%
confidence interval {[}CI] 1.65-51.1), those who had acquired the flu in
a long-term care facility (ORa 11.9, 95% CI 1.06-134), and those with
hyperlactataemia (ORa 1.89, 95% CI 1.20-3.00).
Conclusions. Seasonal influenza is a serious problem leading to elevated
mortality in octogenarian and nonagenarian patients admitted to a
general hospital.

N2  - Background: The mean age of people undergoing dialysis therapy has been
on the rise because of improved survival in this patient population, as
well as the reduced availability of transplants for elderly patients.
Aging in Japanese dialysis patients is more rapid than those in the
United States and Europe. Frailty is generally considered as an
age-related fragile state, and a condition in which the individual is in
a vulnerable state at increased risk of adverse health outcomes and/or
dying when exposed to a stressor. This review focuses on the
underscoring the importance of identifying physical frailty in
hemodialysis patients and proposes an algorithm integrating frailty
assessment into the routine care of patients treated with dialysis.
Summary: Physical frailty is highly prevalent in patients undergoing
hemodialysis, and can potentially be prevented or treated with
management of physical frailty. The management of physical frailty
consists of identifying physical inactivity and poor physical
performance and the individualized prescription of exercise. While
expert clinical guidelines focus on management of patients in the
outpatient dialysis care setting, it is not included in routine clinical
care of dialysis facilities. Little is known about the management of
frailty in the hemodialysis population and its effects on health
outcomes. Further research is needed to define optimal strategies for
screening and treatment of frailty in this vulnerable population. Key
Messages: Management of physical frailty, which is composed of
identification of poor physical performance and physical inactivity and
exercise intervention, as usual care in patients undergoing hemodialysis
may improve their quality of life and prognosis. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG,

LTCI need certification



N2  - CKD is associated with impairments in health status, physical function, and frailty. The aim of the current prospective cohort study was to determine whether CKD predicted new LTCI need certification among community-dwelling older Japanese adults. This was a prospective cohort study. We analyzed the cohort data from a prospective study, The Japan Multicenter Aging Cohort for Care Prevention (J-MACC). We followed 8063 elderly adults for 2 years, and we analyzed the relationship between CKD and LTCI need. The outcome studied was new certification for LTCI service need during a 2-year period. We measured serum creatinine (the estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR), serum albumin, frailty checklist scores, and body mass index. During the 2-year follow-up, 536 subjects (6.6%) were newly certified as needing LTCI services. We stratified the cohort according to eGFR quartile and performed multivariate analyses using an eGFR value of 71.4-83.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) as a reference. We found that subjects with eGFR values <60.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) had a significantly elevated risk of LTCI service need (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.44 [95% CI 1.12-1.86]). Our results indicate that CKD is independently associated with new LTCI service need certification and is an important marker of frailty in older adults.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the acute and late outcomes of a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) program including both the transfemoral (TF) and transapical (TA) approaches; and 2) to determine the results of TAVI in patients deemed inoperable because of either porcelain aorta or frailty. BACKGROUND: Very few data exist on the results of a comprehensive TAVI program including both TA and TF approaches for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with the Edwards valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, California) between January 2005 and June 2009 in 6 Canadian centers were included. RESULTS: A total of 345 procedures (TF: 168, TA: 177) were performed in 339 patients. The predicted surgical mortality (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score) was 9.8 +/- 6.4%. The procedural success rate was 93.3%, and 30-day mortality was 10.4% (TF: 9.5%, TA: 11.3%). After a median follow-up of 8 months (25th to 75th interquartile range: 3 to 14 months) the mortality rate was 22.1%. The predictors of cumulative late mortality were peri-procedural sepsis (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48 to 8.28) or need for hemodynamic support (HR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.11 to 6), pulmonary hypertension (PH) (HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.38 to 3.84), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.83). Patients with either porcelain aorta (18%) or frailty (25%) exhibited acute outcomes similar to the rest of the study population, and porcelain aorta patients tended to have a better survival rate at 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A TAVI program including both TF and TA approaches was associated with comparable mortality as predicted by surgical risk calculators for the treatment of patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk, including porcelain aorta and frail patients. Baseline (PH, COPD, CKD) and peri-procedural (hemodynamic support, sepsis) factors but not the approach determined worse outcomes.

N2  - Upon peritoneal dialysis (PD) discontinuation in frail patients, we have re-embedded the catheter and left it subcutaneously buried. However, we have not evaluated the long-term prognosis of those patients after the procedure or the complications associated with buried catheters. We therefore aimed to clarify the long-term prognosis of patients with a re-embedded catheter and to identify any associated complications.The outcomes of 10 patients having a catheter that was re-embedded between February 2010 and May 2016 were assessed by interviewing the patients or their families (when possible), and by reviewing medical records.Catheter re-embedding to reduce the surgical burden was elected by 7 patients, and 3 patients underwent re-embedding because they wanted to resume PD in the future. By the time of the interviews, 6 patients had already died of causes that were unrelated either to the buried catheter or infection. No abnormality was found in any buried catheter. A re-embedded catheter was later externalized to resume PD in 1 of the 4 patients who survived.Catheter re-embedding is safe and allows for PD resumption at the terminal stage of dialysis.

N2  - Palliative care is a branch of medicine dedicated to the relief of symptoms experienced during the course of illness. Renal palliative medicine or kidney supportive care is an evolving branch of nephrology, which incorporates the principles of palliative care into the care of CKD and ESRD (dialysis, transplant, and conservatively managed) patients. Conservative (non-dialytic) management is a legitimate option for frail, elderly CKD patients in whom dialysis may not lead to an improvement in quality or duration of life. Patients with advanced CKD have a high symptom burden that often worsens before death. Palliative or supportive care by visiting nurses, palliative care programs, or knowledgeable CKD programs should be routine for conservatively managed CKD patients. Decision-making about dialysis or conservative management requires patients and families be given information on prognosis, quality of life on dialysis, and options for supportive care. Advance care planning is the process by which these issues can be explored. In addition to advance care planning, because patients with ESRD have a high symptom burden, this needs to be addressed. Patients with ESRD have a high symptom burden, which needs to be addressed in any treatment plan. Common symptoms include pain, fatigue, insomnia, pruritus, anorexia, and nausea. Symptoms appear to increase as the patient nears death, and this must be anticipated. Recommendations for management are discussed in the article. Hospice care should be offered to all patients who are expected to die within the next 6 months, and supportive care should be provided to all CKD patients managed conservatively or with dialysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: It is known that sarcopenia is related to malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis (MIA) syndrome and is an important problem in dialysis patients. The notion of frailty includes various physical, psychological, and social aspects. Although it has been reported that sarcopenia is associated with poor prognosis in patients with hemodialysis, reports on peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are rare. In this study, we examined the morbidity and mortality of sarcopenia and frailty in PD patients. We also investigated the MIA-related factors. METHODS: We evaluated 119 patients cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria and the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) were used to diagnose sarcopenia and frailty. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality with sarcopenia and frailty. The secondary outcome is the relationship between various MIA-related factors. RESULTS: Morbidity of sarcopenia and frailty in PD patients was 8.4% and 10.9%, respectively. Old age, high values of Barthel Index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, CFS, and low values of body mass index (BMI), muscle strength, muscle mass, and slow walking were associated with sarcopenia. Interleukin-6, albumin, and prealbumin were significantly correlated with muscle mass. During follow-up, the presence of sarcopenia or frailty was associated with the risk of mortality. In multivariate analysis, CFS was related to the mortality rate of PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of sarcopenia or frailty was associated with a worse prognosis.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Frailty, which is a geriatric syndrome characterized by weakness, impaired mobility, balance, and minimal reserve, is highly prevalent in the renal population. While distinct from disability and comorbidity, some of the simplest and most clinically useful scales incorporate both the burden of medical symptoms and the effect on functional independence into the evaluation of frailty. In the renal population, the frailty phenotype has been shown to correlate with important outcomes such as hospitalization and survival. Further work is required to establish if the presence of, and the treatments used for renal disease, promote the sick role and decreased participation in exercise with overestimation of frailty or if the frailty phenotype identifies people who may benefit from rehabilitation and other interventions.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - This study investigated the outcomes and the prognostic factors among the very elderly (patients >/=80 years old) requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV).Between 2006 and 2014, all of the very elderly patients of age 80 or more transferred to respiratory care center (RCC) of a tertiary medical center were retrospectively identified, and only patients who used mechanical ventilation (MV) for >3 weeks were included in this study.A total of 510 very elderly patients undergoing PMV were identified. The mean age of the patients was 84.3 +/- 3.3 years, and it ranged from 80 to 96 years. Male comprised most of the patients (n = 269, 52.7%), and most of the patients were transferred to RCC from medical ICU (n = 357, 70.0%). The APACHE II scores on RCC admission was 17.6 +/- 6.0. At least 1 comorbidity was found in 419 (82.2%) patients. No significant differences of gender, disease severity, diagnosis, dialysis, laboratory examinations, comorbidities, and outcome were found between octogenarians (aged 80-89) and nonagenarians (aged >/= 90). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 21.8%. In the multivariate analysis, patients who had APACHE II score >/= 15(odds ratio [OR], 2.30, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-3.90), or albumin </= 2 g/dL (OR, 3.92, 95% CI, 2.17-7.01) were more likely to have significant in-hospital mortality (P < 0.05).The in-hospital mortality rate of the very elderly PMV patients in our RCC is 21.8%, and poor outcomes in this specific population were found to be associated with a higher APACHE II score and lower albumin level.

N2  - Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have changed the paradigm of
anticoagulation management, improving patient convenience as well as
possibly reducing the incidence of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage.
However, concerns remain with these agents because of the lack of
monitoring capacity and availability of readily accessible specific
antidotes. This is particularly pertinent in the older population,
specifically the frail older adults who have multiple comorbidities,
higher risk of falls, and increased bleeding risk. This group has not
been specifically studied in the DOAC randomized controlled trials and,
hence, extrapolation of these data into this population should be done
cautiously. We provide a review of the use of DOACs in the older frail
population from both hematological and geriatric perspectives, as well
as propose an algorithm for how these agents may be used in this frail
population.

significantly higher fat percentage of all appendices, but not that of their trunk (P = 0.26) or cephalic area (P = 0.99) (Table 1).

In addition, being frail/prefrail was also independently associated with higher appendicular fat percentages (for left, right lower and right upper extremities, β = 0.33, 0.32, and 0.33, t = 2.31, 2.28, and 2.35, P = 0.03, 0.03, and 0.03, respectively), but not with fat percentages of trunk (P = 0.39) and cephalic (P = 0.99) areas.

On the contrary, being frail/prefrail was uniformly associated with significantly lower lean mass of all anatomical sites examined.
N2  - Results: Overall, 15.4% and 51.3% participants (aged 68.3 ± 10.6 years, 49% men, mean 3.5 years of dialysis) were frail and prefrail, respectively. No significant differences regarding age (P = 0.11), gender (P = 0.08), dialysis duration (P = 0.6), comorbidities including diabetes mellitus (P = 0.12), hypertension (P = 0.51), heart failure (P = 0.36), malignancy (P = 0.74), body mass index (BMI; P = 0.5), and laboratory panels were observed between ESRD patients with and without frailty/prefrailty (Table 1), except higher serum creatinine among nonfrail/prefrail ones (P = 0.03). Frail/prefrail ESRD patients had significantly lower total body mass and total lean mass of the whole body and of all anatomical sites, than nonfrail ones (Table 1). However, we found that frail/prefrail ESRD patients had significantly higher fat percentage of all appendices, but not that of their trunk (P = 0.26) or cephalic area (P = 0.99) (Table 1). Univariate analyses revealed that age, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, and SFS scores (all complying with normal distribution, with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test P > 0.05) exhibited significant associations with total lean mass, fat percentages, and those of different anatomical sites, whereas BMI, dialysis duration, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels did not. Stepwise multivariate linear regression with lean body mass and fat percentages as the dependent variables, incorporating significant variables identified in univariate analyses, showed that SFS scores were independently associated with higher appendicular fat percentage (for left, right lower and left, right upper extremities, β = 0.34, 0.3, 0.37, and 0.43, t = 2.32, 2.05, 2.66, and 3.09, P = 0.03, 0.048, 0.01, and <0.01, respectively), but not with those of truncal (β = 0.12, t = 0.76, P = 0.45) and cephalic (β = 0.13, t = 0.72, P = 0.48) areas. In addition, being frail/prefrail was also independently associated with higher appendicular fat percentages (for left, right lower and right upper extremities, β = 0.33, 0.32, and 0.33, t = 2.31, 2.28, and 2.35, P = 0.03, 0.03, and 0.03, respectively), but not with fat percentages of trunk (P = 0.39) and cephalic (P = 0.99) areas. On the contrary, being frail/prefrail was uniformly associated with significantly lower lean mass of all anatomical sites examined. Finally, to satisfy the presumptions of multivariate linear regression analyses and to ensure model validity, we checked the distribution pattern of the residuals of these models and evaluated the possibility of multicollinearity. The residuals for all models were normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test P = 0.2), and variance inflation factor for all models were lower than five, suggesting the absence of multicollinearity.

repeated hospitalizations

early study
N2  - A new category of patients aged >75 yrs, namely the elderly, is now being freely  admitted to hemodialysis (HD) and this category is becoming predominant. The absence of systematic studies makes this patient category almost indistinguishable from other categories, even though its peculiarity is now evident. At least 30-40% of individuals in this age bracket are expected to be dependent and/or frail, but the incidence of frailty is likely to be higher in the elderly undergoing HD. Due to severe physical and/or mental impairment and often because of strong social hardships, these patients rarely experience clinical stability and are dependent on third parties for their survival. Their care produces complex problems for welfare services and this has proved responsible for modifying the organization of renal care units. These repeated patient admissions to hospital are filling nephrology facilities, and the dialysis management -- mainly concerning outpatients -- requires a much greater use of facilities and staff than normal if compared to average dialysis patients. In 112 elderly patients consecutively admitted to the dialysis program over a period of 10 yrs, we identified 35 dependent or frail patients (31.2%), even taking into consideration only extreme degrees of infirmity. Dependence proved to be the only clinical parameter associated with survival (mortality at 6 months 23.6 vs. 10.6%, p<0.01; Kaplan-Meier survival curves, p<0.03 log-rank test), while comorbidities -- in particular cardiovascular -- that usually affect dialysis mortality rates, did not seem to be discriminating risk factors in the elderly. More precisely, with the confirmation of these data through wider case studies, the idea will be reinforced that, also in dialysis, the elderly must be constantly monitored for dependence and frailty, as is the case in any exclusively geriatric field. Prevention, as well as a therapeutic approach specifically modeled on these conditions, could help to improve the prognosis of this patient category, which is particularly difficult to deal with and is becoming predominant in dialysis units.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Technique failure is a major limitation of peritoneal  dialysis. Our study aimed to identify center- and patient-level predictors of peritoneal dialysis technique failure. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All patients on incident peritoneal dialysis in Australia from 2004 to 2014 were included in the study using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. Center- and patient-level characteristics associated with technique failure were evaluated using Cox shared frailty models. Death-censored technique failure and cause-specific technique failure were analyzed as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The study included 9362 patients from 51 centers in Australia. The technique failure rate was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.36) episodes per patient-year, with a sevenfold variation across centers that was mainly associated with center-level characteristics. Technique failure was significantly less likely in centers with larger proportions of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (>29%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.94) and more likely in smaller centers (<16 new patients per year; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.21) and centers with lower proportions of patients achieving target baseline serum phosphate levels (<40%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.29). Similar results were observed for death-censored technique failure, except that center target phosphate achievement was not significantly associated. Technique failure due to infection, social reasons, mechanical causes, or death was variably associated with center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal dialysis, and/or target phosphate achievement, automated peritoneal dialysis exposure, icodextrin use, and antifungal use. The variation of hazards of technique failure across centers was reduced by 28% after adjusting for patient-specific factors and an additional 53% after adding center-specific factors. CONCLUSIONS: Technique failure varies widely across centers in Australia. A significant proportion of this variation is related to potentially modifiable center characteristics, including peritoneal dialysis center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal dialysis, and proportion of patients on peritoneal dialysis achieving target phosphate level.

N2  - CONTEXT: It has become commonplace to use family caregivers as proxy responders where patients are unable to provide information about their symptoms and concerns to health care providers. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the degree of concordance between patients' and family members' reports of patient symptoms and concerns at end of life. METHODS: Sample dyads included a mix of patients residing at home, in a nursing home, in a long-term care facility, or in hospice. Diagnoses included patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 75), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 52), end-stage renal disease (n = 42), and institutionalized, cognitively intact frail elderly (n = 49). Dyads completed the Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI), the modified Structured Interview Assessment of Symptoms and Concerns in Palliative Care, and Graham and Longman's two-item Quality of Life Scale. RESULTS: Concordance was less than 70% for seven of the 25 PDI items, with the lowest concordance (65.1%) for the item "not being able to continue with my usual routines." For all but one PDI item, discordance was in the direction of family members reporting that the patient was worse off than the patient had indicated. Where discordance was observed on the Structured Interview Assessment of Symptoms and Concerns in Palliative Care and Quality of Life Scales, the trend toward family members overreporting patient distress and poor quality of life continued. CONCLUSION: Understanding discordance between patients and family member reports of symptoms and concerns is a valuable step toward minimizing patient and family burden at end of life.

N1  - Did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The 'demographic imperative' of a progressively aging society will place unprecedented demands on the health care system in the 21st century. Although improved education, public health measures, personal lifestyles, and health care will result in a large proportion of those born surviving to old age in robust health and vitality, the sheer numbers of 'baby-boomers' who will become the elderly and the inevitable association between aging and the associated multiple, especially chronic diseases and physiological impairments of old age will require more efficient and more effective systems of health care to meet the needs of the aging population. Generalists, specialists, and medical and surgical subspecialists will play important roles in meeting these needs, often in the multidisciplinary mode. Geriatricians will directly provide but a small minority of the care, focusing upon education, research, and consultation and in delivering primary care to the frail elderly and especially in long term care. Collaboration with subspecialists will be frequent in all these domains. Nephrologists, who already practice multidisciplinary team care of frail, complicated, chronically ill patients with end-stage renal disease, have much to contribute as their patient population progressively grows in numbers and age. Hence geriatricians and nephrologists have much to learn from and contribute to each other in addressing the 'age wave' of the 21st century.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients with pre-dialysis CKD. METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385 patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of </=24. We determined the prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages G4-G5, not on dialysis. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5 had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function (p <0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes deserves further study.

N2  - Objective: to outline the epidemiological and socioeconomic profile of older people on hemodialysis. Methodology: a quantitative, descriptive, cross study, held in dialysis clinics with 80 elderly people of both sexes. Results: with regard to the duration of hemodialysis, the mean was 3.03 years of treatment, the majority of patients have a minimum wage income, 70.2 % of men are married and 48.5 % of women are widows, 81, 3 % did not complete grammar school. As far as epidemiological data are concerned: 52.5 % had systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 25 %, 41.3 % had a co-morbidity, being hypertension and heart disease the most frequent; 23.1 % and 11, 5 % respectively. Discussion: the elderly´s condition is worsened by social deprivation and the need for preventive measures to control hypertension and diabetes, in order to avoid possible additional suffering to poverty, which is a predisposing factor for unhealthy aging. Conclusion: in the Brazilian context preventive actions that promote healthy aging are still not sufficiently performed by health professionals, although these actions are legally covered by public policy.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - During the last 20 years, waiting lists for renal transplantation (RT) have grown significantly older. However, elderly patients (ie >/=65 years of age) are still more rarely referred or accepted to waiting lists and, if enlisted, have less chances of actually receiving a kidney allograft, than younger counterparts. In this review, we looked at evidence for the benefits and risks of RT in the elderly trying to answer the following questions: Should RT be advocated for elderly patients? What should be the criteria to accept elderly patients on the waiting list for RT? What strategies might be used to increase the rate of RT in waitlisted elderly candidates? For selected elderly patients, RT was shown to be superior to dialysis in terms of patient survival. Virtually all guidelines recommend that patients should not be deemed ineligible for RT based on age alone, although a short life expectancy generally might preclude RT. Concerning the assessment of comorbidities in the elderly, special attention should be paid to cardiac evaluation and screening for malignancy. Comorbidity scores and frailty assessment scales might help the decision making on eligibility. Psychosocial issues should also be evaluated. To overcome the scarcity of organ donors, elderly RT candidates should be encouraged to consider expanded criteria donors and living donors, as alternatives to deceased standard criteria donors. It has been demonstrated that expanded criteria donor RT in patients 60 years or older is associated with higher survival rates than remaining on dialysis, whereas living donor RT is superior to all other options.

N2  - Background: The pathogenesis of falling is complex, and identification of risk factors may be essential for prevention. The relationship between renal disease and falls is unclear, and the goal of this study was to collect the available evidence and investigate the relationship between accidental falls and renal dysfunction.; Methods: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid SP and Web of Science databases to identify the appropriate literature. The themes used were: falls (combined in the title/abstract fall or falls or falling or faller* or fallen or slip* or trip* or (MeSH) accidental falls) and renal insufficiency (chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases combined in title/abstract renal disease* or kidney disease* or renal insufficiency or kidney insufficiency or kidney failure or renal failure or MeSH renal insufficiency, chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases). The incidence, risk factors, complications, and characteristics of the falls were analyzed.; Results: Eight prospective cohorts including five cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study were identified. No randomized controlled studies were found. The incidence of falls in chronic kidney disease patients ranged between 1.18 and 1.60 fall/patient year. These were frequent in frail older adults on hemodialysis treatment. Falling relapses in the same group of patients caused serious consequences. Data on pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) were scarce.; Conclusions: The risk of falling appears to be common in patients with renal dysfunction especially in older adults undergoing hemodialysis. On the other hand, we could not find any conclusive data on pre-ESRD patients.;

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - BACKGROUND: The levels of many laboratory parameters are associated with the outcomes of dialysis patients, but the significance of their variability has not been well studied. METHODS: A total of 384 patients receiving stable hemodialysis treatment during 2002 were followed up for mortality until the end of 2013. The within-patient coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for 13 laboratory parameters from 1 year of data. We defined variability as CV and analyzed the survival of the patients according to the baseline CV values of each parameter by proportional hazard modeling. RESULTS: During the 11-year observation period, 125 patients died. Higher CV levels for eight parameters, namely, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, hemoglobin, creatinine, total protein, albumin, potassium and phosphate, were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The adjusted hazard ratios for a high BUN-CV (>15 %) and a high Na-CV (>1.3 %) against a lower CV were 1.92 (95 % CI 1.31-2.81) and 1.95 (1.36-2.80), respectively. The increased mortality risk associated with each variability was attributed to excess non-cardiac deaths. The CV values of most parameters were correlated with each other and often exhibited negative associations with age, diabetes, and mobility as well as the levels of hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, Na, the protein catabolic rate, and the creatinine generation rate. Therefore, a high variability was generally associated with frailty-related adverse prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The variability of several blood parameters had a significant impact on all-cause and non-cardiac mortality. The levels of the variabilities were most likely related to poor physical conditions of the patients.

N2  - Background: Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults but is
underrecognized and undertreated. The approach to pain assessment and
management in older adults requires an understanding of the physiology
of aging, validated assessment tools, and common pain presentations
among older adults.
Objective: To identify the overall principles of pain management in
older adults with a specific focus on common painful conditions and
approaches to pharmacologic treatment.
Methods: We searched PubMed for common pain presentations in older
adults with heart failure, end-stage renal disease, dementia, frailty,
and cancer. We also reviewed guidelines for pain management. Our review
encompassed 2 guidelines, 10 original studies, and 22 review articles
published from 2000 to the present. This review does not discuss
nonpharmacologic treatments of pain.
Results: Clinical guidelines support the use of opioids in persistent
nonmalignant pain. Opioids should be used in patients with moderate or
severe pain or pain not otherwise controlled but with careful attention
to potential toxic effects and half-life. In addition, clinical practice
guidelines recommend use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
with extreme caution and for defined, limited periods.
Conclusion: An understanding of the basics of pain pathophysiology,
assessment, pharmacologic management, and a familiarity with common pain
presentations will allow clinicians to effectively manage pain for older
adults. (C) 2013 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. All rights reserved.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - In end-stage renal failure, natriuresis decreases, sodium accumulates, and extracellular volume (ECV) excess develops. In 1962, Scribner, reporting about the first maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patient, observed that ECV control using a low-salt diet and ultrafiltration led to blood pressure (BP) normalization. Thus, the concept of dry weight, the ideal postdialysis weight allowing for a stable normal BP, was born. Achieving dry weight requires a combination of negative diffusive sodium balance, adequate ultrafiltration, and a low-salt diet. Unfortunately, the low-salt diet is very often neglected today. In the late 1960s, BP control was achieved in 90% of HD patients using low-sodium dialysis and a low-salt diet. As time passed and HD duration was reduced, there was a worsening BP control and subsequent increasing in morbidity and mortality. In recent years, interventional studies have examined the effects of reducing sodium in dialysate, in diet, or in both. All of them show that low-salt diet is essential for BP control in HD. While the healthy population is advised to eat a reasonably low-salt diet (5 g of NaCl), the K/DOQI Guidelines and the European Best Practice Guidelines surprisingly do not even mention salt restriction. To achieve dry weight under the present conditions, with short HD duration and a frail population, it is mandatory to reduce the interdialytic weight gain. A low-salt diet is, more than ever, a necessity.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Geriatric syndrome is common among older patients on dialysis. Basic knowledge about its prevalence and management is crucial for nephrologists to provide standard patient care. In busy clinical settings, up-to-date and holistic medical care can be delivered to elderly dialysis patients by collaboration of nephrology and geriatrics teams, or in part by training nephrology fellows the basics of geriatrics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty has been defined as a tool to define individuals who lack functional reserve and are at risk for functional decline. We hypothesized that chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) would be associated with a greater prevalence of frailty and disability in the elderly. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data collected from the Cardiovascular Health Study, which enrolled 5,888 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older from 4 clinical centers in the United States. Renal insufficiency is defined as a serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL or greater (> or =115 micromol/L) in women and 1.5 mg/dL or greater (> or =133 micromol/L) in men. Frailty is defined by the presence of 3 of the following abnormalities: unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, measured weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Disability is defined as any self-reported difficulty with activities of daily living. RESULTS: Among 5,808 participants with creatinine levels measured at entry, 15.9% of men (n = 394) and 7.6% of women (n = 254) had CRI. Prevalences of frailty (15% versus 6%; P < 0.001) and disability (12% versus 7%; P = 0.001) were greater in participants with CRI compared with those with normal renal function. After multivariate adjustment for comorbidity, CRI remained significantly associated with frailty (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.41), but not disability (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.69). CONCLUSION: Elderly persons with CRI have a high prevalence of frailty, which may signal their risk for progression to adverse health outcomes. If confirmed in other studies, identification of frailty in patients with CRI may warrant special interventions to preserve their independence, quality of life, and survival.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - BACKGROUND: Time in therapeutic range (TTR) of international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 is important for the safety and effectiveness of warfarin anticoagulation. There are few data on TTR among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in community-based clinical practice. METHODS: Using the US Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF), we examined TTR (using a modified Rosendaal method) among 5,210 patients with AF on warfarin and treated at 155 sites. Patients were grouped into quartiles based on TTR data. Multivariable logistic regression modeling with generalized estimating equations was used to determine patient and provider factors associated with the lowest (worst) TTR. RESULTS: Overall, 59% of the measured INR values were between 2.0 and 3.0, with an overall mean and median TTR of 65% +/- 20% and 68% (interquartile range [IQR] 53%-79%). The median times below and above the therapeutic range were 17% (IQR 8%-29%) and 10% (IQR 3%-19%), respectively. Patients with renal dysfunction, advanced heart failure, frailty, prior valve surgery, and higher risk for bleeding (ATRIA score) or stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score) had significantly lower TTR (P < .0001 for all). Patients treated at anticoagulation clinics had only slightly higher median TTR (69%) than those not (66%) (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AF in US clinical practices, TTR on warfarin is suboptimal, and those at highest predicted risks for stroke and bleeding were least likely to be in therapeutic range.

frailty is not simply a pre-disability stage
N2  - The two most commonly employed frailty measures are the frailty phenotype and the frailty index. We compared them to examine whether they demonstrated common characteristics of frailty scales, and to examine their association with adverse health measures including disability, self-reported health, and healthcare utilization. The study examined adults aged 50+ (n = 4096) from a sequential, cross-sectional sample (2003-2004; 2005-2006), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The frailty phenotype was modified from a previously adapted version and a 46-item frailty index was created following a standard protocol. Both measures demonstrated a right-skewed distribution, higher levels of frailty in women, exponential increase with age and associations with high healthcare utilization and poor self-reported health. More people classified as frail by the modified phenotype had ADL disability (97.8%) compared with the frailty index (56.6%) and similarly for IADL disability (95% vs. 85.6%). The prevalence of frailty was 3.6% using the modified frailty phenotype and 34% using the frailty index. Frailty index scores in those who were classified as robust by the modified phenotype were still significantly associated with poor self-reported health and high healthcare utilization. The frailty index and the modified frailty phenotype each confirmed previously established characteristics of frailty scales. The agreement between frailty and disability was high with each measure, suggesting that frailty is not simply a pre-disability stage. Overall, the frailty index classified more people as frail, and suggested that it may have the ability to discriminate better at the lower to middle end of the frailty continuum.

N2  - The management of diabetes in older people is often challenging and poorly researched. The prevalence of cognitive impairment, chronic kidney disease and other co-existing comorbidities increase with age and have a significant impact on glycaemic control targets and treatment options. This conference examined current clinical practice, highlighted differences in the management of diabetes in the older person and suggested potential areas of future research.

vertebral compression fracture (VCF) OR 1.8 (p=0.01)
Femur neck (FN) bone mineral content (BMC) (β = −4, t = −3.17, P = 0.004)
.
The severity of frailty (SFS scores) was negatively correlated with L3 (P = .04), L4 (P = .04), and FN BMD (P &lt; .001). Frail individuals undergoing dialysis were more likely to have VCF (67% vs 24%, P = .04) and had more VCF segments (0.38 vs 1.33, P = .02) than those who were not frail. After adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbidities, regression analyses showed that frailty was negatively associated with FN BMD (β = −4, t = −3.17, P = .004); higher SFS scores were also associated with higher risk of VCF (odds ratio (OR) = 1.8 per point; P = .01). Analyses including prefrail individuals yielded similar results.
N2  - Frailty denotes a decline in ability to manage physiological stressors with aging. Presence of frailty predicts the risk of clinically significant fractures, and frail individuals frequently have osteoporosis.1 Frailty and osteoporosis putatively share a common ground, including coexisting physical inactivity, muscle wasting, weight loss, and nutritional insufficiency.2 Frailty is also highly prevalent in individuals with end‐stage renal disease (ESRD);3 its presence and severity are associated with poor outcomes.4 In addition, individuals with ESRD are at greater risk of hip fracture because of osteoporosis or the abnormal bony architecture resulting from chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (MBD; renal osteodystrophy).5 It is unclear whether the established association between frailty, osteoporosis, and fracture also exists in individuals with ESRD, in whom silent vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are underrecognized.6 The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the relationship between frailty, bone mass, and VCFs in individuals with ESRD.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Most patients starting dialysis can choose between peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. There is little evidence proving that one form of dialysis is better than the other; although there may be an early advantage to peritoneal dialysis (PD) in young patients with residual function this effect is short-lived. Technique failure develops after years on PD so dialysis modality will often change during a long dialysis career. Quality of life studies, which must be interpreted carefully, indicate that patients require information about the impact of dialysis on their lifestyle as well as health-related outcomes so that they can choose the most suitable dialysis modality. Increasing numbers of frail elderly patients are starting dialysis; support in the home by nursing staff may facilitate the use of PD in this group. In the UK guidelines prioritise the patient's choice of dialysis modality (where feasible) based on good quality predialysis education. Cost of treatment is generally lower on PD, which is particularly recommended for patients with residual renal function and few comorbidities.

N2  - To assess whether biopsy-guided selection of kidneys from very old brain-dead donors enables more successful transplantations, the authors of this multicenter, observational study compared graft survival between 37 recipients of 1 or 2 histologically evaluated kidneys from donors older than 80 years and 198 reference-recipients of non-histologically evaluated single grafts from donors aged 60 years and younger (transplantation period: 2006-2013 at 3 Italian centers). During a median (interquartile range) of 25 (13-42) months, 2 recipients (5.4%) and 10 reference-recipients (5.1%) required dialysis (crude and donor age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.55 [0.34-7.12], P = .576 and 1.41 [0.10-19.54], P = .798, respectively). Shared frailty analyses confirmed similar outcomes in a 1:2 propensity score study comparing recipients with 74 reference-recipients matched by center, year, donor, and recipient sex and age. Serum creatinine was similar across groups during 84-month follow-up. Recipients had remarkably shorter waiting times than did reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (7.5 [4.0-19.5] vs 36 [19-56] and 40 [24-56] months, respectively, P < .0001 for both comparisons). Mean (+/- SD) kidney donor risk index was 2.57 +/- 0.32 in recipients vs 1.09 +/- 0.24 and 1.14 +/- 0.24 in reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (P < .0001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were similar across groups. Biopsy-guided allocation of kidneys from octogenarian donors permits further expansion of the donor organ pool and faster access to a kidney transplant, without increasing the risk of premature graft failure.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - It is often of interest to compare centers or healthcare providers on quality of  care delivered. We consider the setting where evaluation of center performance on multiple competing events is of interest. We propose estimating center effects through cause-specific proportional hazards frailty models that allow correlation among a center's cause-specific effects. Estimation of our model proceeds via penalized partial likelihood and is implemented in R. To evaluate center performance, we also propose a directly standardized excess cumulative incidence (ECI) measure. Therefore, based on our proposed methods, practitioners can evaluate centers either through the cause-specific hazards or the cumulative incidence functions. We demonstrate, through simulations, the advantages of the proposed methods to detect outlying centers, by comparing the proposed methods and existing methods which assume uncorrelated random center effects. In addition, we develop a Correlation Score Test to test the null hypothesis that the competing event processes within a center are correlated. Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we apply our method to evaluate the performance of Organ Procurement Organizations on two competing risks: (i) receipt of a kidney transplant and (ii) death on the wait-list.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - According to the current status of chronic dialysis therapy in Japan 2016, the average age at the time of dialysis initiation is 68.57 years for males and 71.19 years for females, which has been rising continuously. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that is frequently seen in the elderly. It is known that frailty among dialysis patients are more common than the general population of the same age, and that frailty is associated with life prognosis. As eGFR decreases, BMD decreases and fracture risk increase, and dialysis patients are at the highest risk of fracture in CKD patients. Various factors such as frailty, sarcopenia, PEW(protein-energy wasting), dynapenia, uremic osteoporosis, diabetes, AGEs(advanced glycation end products), oxidative stress, falls are involved in the increased risk of fracture in dialysis patients, and consequently, fragile fractures occur frequently in dialysis patients. Fragile fracture is a common complication in dialysis patients, and it is reported that the hospitalization for fracture, and the subsequent course is associated with poor prognosis. In diabetes, bone quality declines without loss of BMD, so the conventional DXA method may be insufficient in predicting fracture risk among dialysis patients, and the evaluation method using HR-pQCT or FRAXR may be useful. It has been reported that bisphosphonate is an established therapy in patients with primary osteoporosis, but many bisphosphonates cannot be used at eGFR of less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Bisphosphonate-related adverse effects such as accumulation, ossification, osteomalacia, ADB(adynamic bone), and jaw bone necrosis were reported, there are few reports of usefulness in CKD patients. Denosumab administration trial results for women with osteoporosis in dialysis patients have been waited(NCT 01464931). In this article, we outline the relation, diagnosis, and treatment of fragile fractures and frailty in dialysis patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) candidates often present with multiple comorbidities. These patients also have a substantial burden of frailty, which is also associated with increased mortality. However, it is unknown if frailty is merely a surrogate for comorbidity, itself an independent domain of risk, or if frailty and comorbidity have differential effects. Better understanding the interplay between these 2 constructs will improve clinical decision making in KT candidates. OBJECTIVE: To test whether comorbidity is equally associated with waitlist mortality among frail and nonfrail KT candidates and to test whether measuring both comorbidity burden and frailty improves mortality risk prediction. METHODS: We studied 2,086 candidates on the KT waitlist (November 2009 - October 2017) in a multicenter cohort study, in whom frailty and comorbidity were measured at evaluation. We quantified the association between Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) adapted for end-stage renal disease and waitlist mortality using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model and tested whether this association differed between frail and nonfrail candidates. RESULTS: At evaluation, 18.1% of KT candidates were frail and 51% had a high comorbidity burden (CCI score >/=2). Candidates with a high comorbidity burden were at 1.38-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.89) increased risk of waitlist mortality. However, this association differed by frailty status (p for interaction = 0.01): among nonfrail candidates, a high comorbidity burden was associated with a 1.66-fold (95% CI 1.17-2.35) increased mortality risk; among frail candidates, here was no statistically significant association (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.44-1.29). Adding this interaction between comorbidity and frailty to a mortality risk estimation model significantly improved prediction, increasing the c-statistic from 0.640 to 0.656 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Nonfrail candidates with a high comorbidity burden at KT evaluation have an increased risk of waitlist mortality. Importantly, comorbidity is less of a concern in already high-risk patients who are frail.

N2  - INTRODUCTION:: Haemodialysis patients are at an increased risk of sarcopenia. Physical inactivity is now recognised as a major cause of muscle wasting in haemodialysis patients. It is unclear as to what and how much exercise is required to show benefit. We therefore performed a pilot study of cycling during haemodialysis. METHODS:: Patients underwent a progressive submaximal individualised cycling exercise, 3x a week during haemodialysis for 4 months using bed-cycle ergometers. Body composition was measured by multifrequency segmental bioimpedance and muscle function by 6-min walking test, and hand grip strength and pinch strength. RESULTS:: In total, 56% of patients in a dialysis centre fulfilled exercise study inclusion criteria and 13 (72.2%) of 18 patients completed the exercise programme, with the mean age of 64.0 +/- 16.6 years and 76.9% being male. The 6-min walking test increased following exercise from 349 +/- 105 to 398 +/- 94.2 m, p < 0.05, as did both hand grip strength and pinch strength, with 20.4 +/- 9.1 versus 23.4 +/- 9.9 kg, p < 0.01, and 4.3 +/- 1.8 versus 5.9 +/- 2.4 kg, p < 0.05, respectively. There were no changes in appendicular muscle mass or other body composition detected with bioimpedance in either the exercise group, or 21 control patients, propensity matched for body composition, comorbidity and frailty. Muscle strength did not change in the control group. Haemodialysis sessional Kt/Vurea was greater at the end of the exercise programme compared to controls (1.63 +/- 0.63 vs 1.21 +/- 0.12, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION:: The majority of dialysis centre patients met our exercise study entry criteria and could potentially benefit from cycling during haemodialysis. We found that muscle function and strength improved after a 4-month, thrice weekly cycling exercise programme.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: The age of patients with end-stage renal disease is increasing in Europe and United States. In France, patients older than 75 years represent 40% of the patients who start renal replacement therapy (dialysis or renal transplantation). In these elderly patients with many comorbidities, the benefit of dialysis remains controversial. To provide clear information to patients about diagnosis, prognosis, and all treatment options, more data are needed on their clinical characteristics, therapeutic projects, and outcome. METHODS: Researchers present here the ongoing Parcours de Soins des PersonnesAgees (PSPA) multicenter prospective study, which includes 581 patients with a mean age of 82+/-5 years and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (by sMDRD) of 14+/-4ml/min/1.73m(2) without dialysis. RESULTS: Despite a high prevalence of associated comorbidities, most of the patients are autonomous, living at home. Less than 10% are followed jointly by a nephrologist and a geriatrician. At inclusion, postponed dialysis decision due to stable estimated glomerular filtration rate was reported in 43%, 17% of the patients are under evaluation, the decision to start dialysis was chosen in 24% of the patients, nondialysis decision was decided in 16%. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatricians' expertise may help nephrologists to identify patients at high risk of early death for who nondialysis care may be discussed. They also may be more able to evaluate and anticipate the impact of such restricting treatments. A multidisciplinary approach of these old and frail patients' needs to be reinforced.

less active on the LoPAQ
N2  - OBJECTIVES: Physical activity questionnaires usually focus on moderate to vigorous activities and may not accurately capture physical activity or variation in levels of activity among extremely inactive groups like dialysis patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Three dialysis facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area. SUBJECTS: Sixty-eight prevalent hemodialysis patients. INTERVENTION: We administered a new physical activity questionnaire designed to capture activity in the lower end of the range, the Low Physical Activity Questionnaire (LoPAQ). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Outcome measures were correlation with a validated physical activity questionnaire, the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity (LTA) questionnaire and with self-reported physical function (physical function score of the SF-36) and physical performance (gait speed, chair stand, balance, and short physical performance battery). We also determined whether patients who were frail or reported limitations in activities of daily living were less active on the LoPAQ. RESULTS: Sixty-eight participants (mean age 59 +/- 14 years, 59% men) completed the study. Patients were inactive according to the LoPAQ, with a median (interquartile range) of 517 (204-1190) kcal/week of physical activity. Although activity from the LTA was lower than on the LoPAQ (411 [61-902] kcal/week), the difference was not statistically significant (P = .20), and results from the 2 instruments were strongly correlated (rho = 0.62, P < .001). In addition, higher physical activity measured by the LoPAQ was correlated with better self-reported functioning (rho = 0.64, P < .001), better performance on gait speed (rho = 0.32, P = .02), balance (rho = 0.45, P < .001), and chair rising (rho = -0.32, P = .03) tests and with higher short physical performance battery total score (rho = 0.51, P < .001). Frail patients and patients with activities of daily living limitations were less active than those who were not frail or limited. CONCLUSIONS: The LoPAQ performed similarly to the Minnesota LTA questionnaire in our cohort despite being shorter and easier to administer.

N2  - Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International
Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the
multiple nutritional and catabolic alterations that occur in chronic
kidney disease (CKD) and associate with morbidity and mortality. To
increase awareness, identify research needs, and provide the basis for
future work to understand therapies and consequences of PEW, ISRNM
provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology
of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true
undernutrition) due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions
contribute, other highly prevalent factors are required for the full
syndrome to develop. These include uremia-induced alterations such as
increased energy expenditure, persistent inflammation, acidosis, and
multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of hypermetabolism
leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition, comorbid
conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the
dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW. Published by

N2  - Elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or who are on dialysis should be able to live as fully and comfortably as possible. Geriatric patients are most interested in outcomes that will optimize mental and physical function and limit suffering and pain. Nephrologists must help them answer the question: 'How will my kidney problem affect the way I live now and in the future?' This means management must move beyond glomerular filtration rate-related targets and incorporate geriatric principles that focus on assessment of function, comorbidities, geriatric syndromes, and quality of life issues. Therapeutic decisions should be individualized and directed by patient goals of care, which must be explored and documented. Accomplishing this requires inclusion of the patient's family-support system in the shared decision-making process. There is no substitute for spending time listening to and understanding the patient and family agenda, providing timely medical and prognostic updates; discussing realistic scenarios to balance expectations; and planting the seeds of change as the quantity and quality of medical events, geriatric syndromes, and comorbidities accumulate. Synergy of the interdisciplinary renal team with geriatric and palliative medicine specialists provides the expertise to achieve these goals. This falls into the domain of geriatric renal palliative or supportive care (1) and is the subject of this practical review.

with 61 patients. A socio-demographic questionnaire and the geriatric
depression scale (GDS) were used to collect the data. Data analysis
consisted of descriptive statistics and Spearman rho correlations.
Results: The mean age of patients was 69.97 +/- 7.51. The majority was
white (79%), married (72%), and male (57%). Approximate a quarter of
the patients (26%) were illiterate. The mean depression score was 10.43
+/- 4.37, suggesting the presence of normal to slightly depressive
symptoms. Conclusions: There were statistically significant correlation
coefficients between family monthly income and education (p value=0.004)
and between depressive symptoms and illiteracy (p=0.028). This last
finding indicates that the illiterate patients had more depressive
symptoms, suggesting they have less adaptation capacity or resilience to
cope with the disease and its implications.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ...), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

這篇沒有提到Kt/V如何被frailty影響，是受試者baseline test的時候測的。(moderately to severely frail patients have higher dialysis clearace rates)

家德老師只有討論frailty in ESRD如何影響EEG所测得的DAR以及DTABR
N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. However, apart from its influence on cognition, it is currently unknown whether frailty affects subtler cerebral function in patients with ESRD. METHODS: Patients with ESRD were prospectively enrolled, with clinical features and laboratory data recorded. The severity of frailty among these patients with ESRD was ascertained using the previously validated simple FRAIL scale, and was categorized as none-to-mild and moderate-to-severe frailty. All participants underwent quantitative electroencephalography (EEG), with band powers documented following the generation of the delta to alpha ratio (DAR) and delta/theta to alpha/beta ratio (DTABR). EEG results were then compared between groups of different levels of frailty. RESULTS: In this cohort, (mean age: 68.9 +/- 10.4 years, 37% male, 3.4 +/- 3 years of dialysis), 20, 60, 40, 17, and 6% patients exhibited positivity in the fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss-of-body-weight domains, respectively, with 45.7% being none to mildly frail and 54.3% being moderately to severely frail. Those with mild frailty had a significantly higher delta power compared to those with more severe frailty, involving all topographic sites. Patients with ESRD and severe frailty had significantly lower global, left frontal, left temporo-occipital, and right temporo-occipital DAR and DTABR, except in the right frontal area, and tended to have central accentuation of alpha, beta, and theta power, and more homogeneous DTABR and DAR distribution compared to the findings in those with mild frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in patients with ESRD can have subtler neurophysiological influences, presenting as altered EEG findings, which warrant our attention.

N2  - Objective To determine the safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use compared with warfarin use for the treatment of venous thromboembolism.Design Retrospective matched cohort study conducted between 1 January 2009 and 31 March 2016.Setting Community based, using healthcare data from six jurisdictions in Canada and the United States.Participants 59 525 adults (12 489 DOAC users; 47 036 warfarin users) with a new diagnosis of venous thromboembolism and a prescription for a DOAC or warfarin within 30 days of diagnosis.Main outcome measures Outcomes included hospital admission or emergency department visit for major bleeding and all cause mortality within 90 days after starting treatment. Propensity score matching and shared frailty models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of the outcomes comparing DOACs with warfarin. Analyses were conducted independently at each site, with meta-analytical methods used to estimate pooled hazard ratios across sites.Results Of the 59 525 participants, 1967 (3.3%) had a major bleed and 1029 (1.7%) died over a mean follow-up of 85.2 days. The risk of major bleeding was similar for DOAC compared with warfarin use (pooled hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.03), with the overall direction of the association favouring DOAC use. No difference was found in the risk of death (pooled hazard ratio 0.99, 0.84 to 1.16) for DOACs compared with warfarin use. There was no evidence of heterogeneity across centres, between patients with and without chronic kidney disease, across age groups, or between male and female patients.Conclusions In this analysis of adults with incident venous thromboembolism, treatment with DOACs, compared with warfarin, was not associated with an increased risk of major bleeding or all cause mortality in the first 90 days of treatment.Trial registration Clinical trials NCT02833987.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality after 1-year follow-up. METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the occurrence of death after 1 year. RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index. CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing the risk of death in these frail patients.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although arteriovenous fistulas have been found to be  the most cost-effective form of hemodialysis access, the relative benefits of placing an arteriovenous fistula versus an arteriovenous graft seem to be least certain for older adults and when placed preemptively. However, older adults' life expectancy is heterogeneous, and most patients do not undergo permanent access creation until after dialysis initiation. We evaluated cost-effectiveness of arteriovenous fistula placement after dialysis initiation in older adults as a function of age and life expectancy. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using a hypothetical cohort of patients on incident hemodialysis with central venous catheters, we constructed Markov models of three treatment options: (1) arteriovenous fistula placement, (2) arteriovenous graft placement, or (3) continued catheter use. Costs, utilities, and transitional probabilities were derived from existing literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed by age group (65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and 85-89 years old) and quartile of life expectancy. Costs, quality-adjusted life-months, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were evaluated for up to 5 years. RESULTS: The arteriovenous fistula option was cost effective compared with continued catheter use for all age and life expectancy groups, except for 85-89 year olds in the lowest life expectancy quartile. The arteriovenous fistula option was more cost effective than the arteriovenous graft option for all quartiles of life expectancy among the 65- to 69-year-old age group. For older age groups, differences in cost-effectiveness between the strategies were attenuated, and the arteriovenous fistula option tended to only be cost effective in patients with life expectancy >2 years. For groups for which the arteriovenous fistula option was not cost saving, the cost to gain one quality-adjusted life-month ranged from $2294 to $14,042. CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults, the cost-effectiveness of an arteriovenous fistula placed within the first month of dialysis diminishes with increasing age and lower life expectancy and is not the most cost-effective option for those with the most limited life expectancy.

N2  - Background: Exercise improves physical capacity in patients with end-stage renal  disease on haemodialysis (HD), but few patients engage in it. Whole-body vibration exercise (WBVE) is a novel protocol that has been shown to benefit frail elderly patients' rehabilitation. We assessed the utility of WBVE before HD sessions and tested methods to inform the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: Physical condition and quality of life were assessed at enrolment and repeated 2 weeks later in a pilot study of 49 patients undergoing regular HD. All patients then undertook 8 weeks of WBVE, thrice weekly for 3 min, after which the assessments were repeated and results compared (paired t-tests). Further assessments were made after a 4-week layoff. Patients completed a post-study questionnaire about their experiences of using WBVE. The reproducibility of WBVE and effects on measures of functionality, muscle strength, indirect exercise capacity, nutritional status, bone health and quality of life were recorded to undertake a power calculation for an RCT. Results: Of 49 patients enrolled, 25 completed all assessments. The dropout rate was high at 49%, but overall, WBVE was an acceptable form of exercise. Functionality as assessed by the 60-s sit-to-stand test (STS-60) improved significantly by 11% (P = 0.002). Some quality of life domains also improved significantly. All improvements were maintained 4 weeks after discontinuing WBVE. Conclusions: WBVE was acceptable, safe, easily incorporated into the routine of HD and was associated with useful improvements in physical function sufficient to justify a RCT.

N2  - BACKGROUND: For chronic hemodialysis, the ideal permanent vascular access is the  arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Temporary catheters should be reserved for acute dialysis needs. The AVF is associated with lower infection rates, better clinical results, and a higher quality of life and survival when compared to temporary catheters. In Brazil, the proportion of patients with temporary catheters for more than 3 months from the beginning of therapy is used as an evaluation of the quality of renal units. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated with the time between the beginning of hemodialysis with temporary catheters and the placement of the first arteriovenous fistula in Brazil. METHODS: This is an observational, prospective non-concurrent study using national administrative registries of all patients financed by the public health system who began renal replacement therapy (RRT) between 2000 and 2004 in Brazil. Incident patients were eligible who had hemodialysis for the first time. Patients were excluded who: had hemodialysis reportedly started after the date of death (inconsistent database); were younger than 18 years old; had HIV; had no record of the first dialysis unit; and were dialyzed in units with less than twenty patients. To evaluate individual and renal unit factors associated with the event of interest, the frailty model was used (N = 55,589). RESULTS: Among the 23,824 patients (42.9%) who underwent fistula placement in the period of the study, 18.2% maintained the temporary catheter for more than three months until the fistula creation. The analysis identified five statistically significant factors associated with longer time until first fistula: higher age (Hazard-risk - HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00); having hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.98) as the cause of chronic renal disease; residing in capitals cities (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95) and certain regions in Brazil - South (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.8-0.87), Midwest (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94), Northeast (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94), or North (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94) and the type of renal unit (public or private). CONCLUSION: Monitoring the provision of arteriovenous fistulas in renal units could improve the care given to patients with end stage renal disease.

N2  - Frailty is significantly associated with bone loss in the general population. However, it is unclear whether this association also exists in patients undergoing hemodialysis who have chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). This study aimed to assess the association between frailty and bone loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This cross-sectional study included 214 (90 women, 124 men) Japanese outpatients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis three times per week, with a mean age of 67.1 years (women) and 66.8 years (men). Frailty was defined based on criteria set forth by the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)-19 (21.1%) women and 47 (37.9%) men were robust, 41 (45.6%) women and 43 (34.7%) men were pre-frail, and 30 (33.3%) women and 34 (27.4%) men were frail. For bone mass, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters (speed of sound, broadband ultrasound attenuation, stiffness index) of the calcaneus were measured. The association between frailty and QUS parameters was determined separately for women and men using multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with adjustments for clinical characteristics including age, body mass index, hemodialysis vintage, diabetes, current smoking, serum albumin, phosphate, corrected calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, and medication for CKD-MBD (vitamin D receptor activator, calcimimetics). ANCOVA revealed that all QUS parameters declined significantly with increasing levels of frailty in both sexes (P < 0.05). In conclusion, frailty (as defined by CHS criteria) should be considered a risk factor for bone loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - The population with end stage renal disease (ESRD) is becoming
increasingly older and more frail with a high burden of comorbidities,
resulting in increasingly more complex therapy decisions. From an
ethical perspective the four principles by Beauchamp and Childress have
to be considered: dialysis is only justified when patient autonomy,
nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice are guaranteed. With respect to
beneficence, the quality of life is becoming more important than a mere
prolongation of life expectancy. A change in paradigmis noticeable:
dialysis is to be offered to patients who are likely to benefit,
otherwise conservative management should be considered, thus turning
dialysis withdrawal and dialysis withholding into appropriate options.
Advance care planning and shared decision-making allow early and ongoing
involvement of the patient, supporting patient autonomy and beneficence.
This communicative and processual approach requires an appropriate time
frame and special communication skills as well as conflict management.
In the case of conservative management in ESRD best supportive care at
the end of life ensures fulfillment of the individual patient needs,
symptom control and palliative care.

N2  - PURPOSE: Frail patients are known to experience poor outcomes. Nevertheless, we know less about how frailty manifests itself in patients' physiology during critical illness and how it affects resource use in intensive care units (ICU). We aimed to assess the association of frailty with short-term outcomes and organ support used by critically ill patients. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospective collected data from 93 ICUs in Brazil from 2014 to 2015. We assessed frailty using the modified frailty index (MFI). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were discharge home without need for nursing care, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and utilization of ICU organ support and transfusion. We used mixed logistic regression and competing risk models accounting for relevant confounders in outcome analyses. RESULTS: The analysis consisted of 129,680 eligible patients. There were 40,779 (31.4%) non-frail (MFI = 0), 64,407 (49.7%) pre-frail (MFI = 1-2) and 24,494 (18.9%) frail (MFI >/= 3) patients. After adjusted analysis, frailty was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.89-3.08), particularly in patients admitted with lower SOFA scores. Frail patients were less likely to be discharged home (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.54-0.79) and had higher hospital and ICU LOS than non-frail patients. Use of all forms of organ support (mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, dialysis and transfusions) were more common in frail patients and increased as MFI increased. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, as assessed by MFI, was associated with several patient-centered endpoints including not only survival, but also ICU LOS and organ support.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between earlier dialysis initiation and mortality. METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73%. In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P <.001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25-1.97]; P <.001) and time to first hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45]; P <.001). While higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation. Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - BACKGROUND: Several clinical and procedural factors determine outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but data are scarce on the impact of post-TAVR discharge disposition on long-term outcomes. We sought to analyse whether discharge location after TAVR is associated with 1-year outcomes in women undergoing contemporary TAVR. METHODS: The Women's INternational Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (WIN-TAVI) registry is the first all-female TAVR registry to study the safety and performance of contemporary TAVR in women (n = 1019). Information on discharge location was available in 817 patients (80.2%). We compared women discharged home vs those discharged to another location (nursing home, rehabilitation, or other hospital). One-year outcomes were adjusted using multivariable Cox regression methods with discharge home as the reference group. RESULTS: Of the study subjects, 75.2% (n = 614) were discharged home and 24.8% (n = 203) to another location. Women discharged to other locations were older with a greater prevalence of severe lung disease requiring home oxygen and renal failure on dialysis but were less frequently considered frail or at high surgical risk compared with women discharged home. After multivariable adjustment, non-home discharge was associated with greater hazard for 1-year Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 efficacy (21.3% vs 10.8%, hazards ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.9) and safety endpoints (31.5% vs 15.2%, HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.0), cardiovascular death (12.7% vs 5.5%, HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6), and stroke (6.5% vs 0.8%, HR 8.5, 95% CI 2.9-25.6). CONCLUSIONS: In women undergoing contemporary TAVR, discharge disposition significantly affects 1-year risk of outcomes even after adjustment for recorded baseline differences. This might suggest the necessity of considering additional factors beyond comorbidities in the TAVR decision-making process.

Frail participants in the SKS were more likely to be African American; more likely to have prevalent diabetes, heart failure, and angina; and more likely to be obese (Table 2).
N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy. MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was 51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much older non-CKD reference population (P <0.01). The most common frailty components were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes, eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a 2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of frailty compared with GFR(cys) >/=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or dialysis therapy. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal relationships between CKD and frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - Background: This study evaluated the impact of body mass index (BMI) and
patient functional status on the risk for surgical complications after
kidney transplant.
Methods: This retrospective cohort study of adult kidney transplant
recipients grouped patients by baseline Karnofsky status (low function
<= 70%) and further stratified by morbid obesity (BMI >= 35 kg/m(2)) to
assess surgical complication risk.
Results: 736 patients were included with surgical complications
occurring in 25%. Logistic regression analysis with interaction terms
demonstrated that morbid obesity and low functional status conditionally
impact risk with an OR of 2.8 {[} 95% CI (1.1-7.3)]. Within the
functional status cohort, BMI >= 35 kg/m(2) was associated with
increased risk of surgical complication, superficial wound infection,
and DGF. Independent predictors for surgical complications included
diabetes and morbid obesity with low functional status. There was no
significant difference in graft loss or death across the cohorts.
Conclusions: While neither morbid obesity nor poor functional status
alone predicts increased complications, the combined presence is
associated with significant increase in risk for surgical complications
after renal transplantation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Advanced age is one of the major determinants of frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis. However, multiple other factors contribute to frailty in these patients. The identification of frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis is critical as it influences the complexity of the anticoagulant treatment in this population at high risk of venous thromboembolism and bleeding. Factors that contribute to frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis include age, type of cancer, comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, poly-pharmacotherapy, treatment compliance, cognitive impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mobility, nutritional status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade, risk of falls, and reduced life expectancy. In the absence of specific clinical studies current anticoagulant treatment guidelines for the management are not fully applicable to frail patients with cancer. The anticoagulant treatment should therefore benefit from a tailored approach based on an algorithm that takes into account the specificities of the malignant disease.;

N2  - PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces frailty and worsens quality of life (QOL), even in the early stages of the disease and in young patients. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the relationship between frailty and QOL in CKD patients. Thus, we investigated this relationship in a sample of CKD patients. METHODS: A cross-observational study was conducted, in which 61 CKD patients receiving pre-dialysis treatment were assessed. All participants completed the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used valid and reliable methods to classify subjects as frail or non-frail according to Johansen's et al. (2007) criteria. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used to compare the groups. In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to measure associations between identified variables and frailty. We also performed simple linear regression using the SF-36 physical and mental composite scores. RESULTS: Almost half of the sample (42.6%) exhibited evidence of frailty. The groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, and all SF-36 domains, excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Frailty was significantly associated with all SF-36 domains, again excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Regression analysis revealed no significant between-group differences in composite physical and mental health scores generated by the SF-36 (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Frail and non-frail CKD patients differed significantly in seven of the eight SF-36 domains. The frail group displayed diminished physical and mental functioning when their SF-36 scores were divided by their physical and mental composite scores. Frailty was correlated with QOL domains, with the exception of the social domain. There is a need for interventions targeting the characteristics of frailty, to provide better treatment and optimize overall QOL.

N2  - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 2% to 4% of patients with severe aortic stenosis. It is because these patients have been excluded from clinical trials, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in this patient group has not been thoroughly investigated. Between April 2008 and March 2015, 2,000 patients (dialysis group, n=56 [2.8%]) were consecutively enrolled when diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and eligible to undergo TAVI. Procedural and longer-term outcomes were analyzed and adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics. Patients on dialysis had a higher periprocedural mortality (10.7% vs 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 5.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.91 to 16.67; p=0.002) and a lower Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-II (VARC) defined device success (adjOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79; p=0.012). At 30 days, there was an increased rate of all-cause mortality (21.4 vs 4.8%; adjOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.96 to 12.26; p=0.001), cardiovascular (adjOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.41; p=0.007) and noncardiovascular mortality (adjOR 6.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 9.41; p=0.019), myocardial infarction (adjOR 9.39, 95% CI 1.84 to 48.03; p=0.007), bleeding (adjOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.83; p=0.036) as well as the VARC-II defined early safety combined end point (adjOR 2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.90; p=0.012) associated with dialysis. Dialysis was associated with poor survival at one (57.1% vs 84.2%) and 3 years (26.8% vs 66.9%) with or without the consideration of the first 72 hours (p <0.001; adjusted p <0.001). Although, in the multivariable regression analysis, reduced ejection fraction, peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH), frailty and dialysis were associated with 1-year mortality, only PH (>60 mm Hg) remained significant in an analysis restricted to the dialysis patients (adjusted hazard ratio 2.68; 95% CI 1.18 to 5.88; p=0.018). PH had a sensitivity of 45.8%, a specificity of 81.3%, and a positive predictive value of 64.7%. In conclusion, dialysis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who underwent TAVI. Long-term mortality in dialysis patients appears to be largely determined by the kidney disease and/or dialysis itself whereas VARC-II defined complications are largely unaffected. An increased short-term mortality still calls for (pre-) procedural optimization.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the attitudes, policies, and barriers for requiring annual versus voluntary influenza vaccinations for the staff of healthcare institutions in North Carolina.METHODS: Five different types of institutions serving at-risk elderly populations throughout North Carolina were chosen for study, including hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes, dialysis centers, and assisted living facilities. Infection control managers completed a 45-question telephone survey on policies for annual influenza vaccinations for employees, incentives to encourage immunizations, support for mandatory influenza vaccinations for workers, barriers to employee vaccinations, and support for a state law to mandate influenza immunizations for-employees with patient care contact.RESULTS: Of 312 institutions, 268 (86%) participated in the study. Only 38% of institutions reported having formal written employee influenza vaccination policies, and only 2% actually mandated annual employee vaccinations. Reported barriers to increasing healthcare worker annual influenza vaccinations included 'fear of side effects' and 'perceived ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine.' Almost half of the respondents would support mandating influenza vaccinations for all healthcare workers with direct patient contact.CONCLUSION: A state-wide survey of the receptivity, policies, and implications of mandated employee influenza vaccinations among healthcare institutions serving the elderly in North Carolina found written policies uncommon and most of the mechanisms used to increase vaccinations voluntary. Efforts should be tailored to individuals, institutions, and healthcare systems to dramatically increase employee immunization rates.

N2  - Background: With increasing longevity and a similar or increased
prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors (as compared to the
general population), people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) are at
risk of developing cardiovascular disease. However, prospective studies
on incidence and influencing factors of cardiovascular disease and
mortality are lacking.
Methods: A three year follow-up study was undertaken to study the
incidence and symptoms at presentation of myocardial accident, stroke
and heart failure in older people with ID. Furthermore, the predictive
value of cardiovascular disease risk factors on myocardial accident,
stroke and heart failure and on all-cause mortality were studied. The
baseline group consisted of the 1050 participants, aged 50 years and
over, in the Dutch Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disability (HA-ID)
study. Baseline measurements were conducted between November 2008 and
July 2010. Three years after baseline, medical files of 790 participants
were studied.
Results: Cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke and heart
failure) occurred in 5.9% of the population during 3 year follow-up,
and 32% of them died due to the condition. Incidence of myocardial
infarction is 2.8 per 1000 personyears, for stroke 3.2 per 1000
personyears and for heart failure 12.5 per 1000 personyears. Incidence
of these conditions is probably underestimated, due to atypical symptom
presentation. The use of atypical antipsychotics and a history of heart
failure were predictive for myocardial infarction. Heart failure was
predicted by abdominal obesity, chronic kidney disease and a history of
heart failure. A total of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction,
stroke or heart failure) was predicted by abdominal obesity, a history
of stroke and a history of heart failure. A low body-mass index,
peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease and inflammation
were predictive for 3-year all-cause mortality.
Conclusion: Incidence of cardiovascular disease in older people with ID
is similar to that in the general population. A pro-active assessment
and treatment of the presented cardiovascular disease risk factors may
reduce cardiovascular disease and mortality in older people with ID. (C)

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty, a validated measure of physiologic reserve, predicts adverse health outcomes among adults with end-stage renal disease. Frailty typically is not measured clinically; instead, a surrogate-perceived frailty-is used to inform clinical decision-making. Because correlations between perceived and measured frailty remain unknown, the aim of this study was to assess their relationship. METHODS: 146 adults undergoing hemodialysis were recruited from a single dialysis center in Baltimore, Maryland. Patient characteristics associated with perceived (reported by nephrologists, nurse practitioners (NPs), or patients) or measured frailty (using the Fried criteria) were identified using ordered logistic regression. The relationship between perceived and measured frailty was assessed using percent agreement, kappa statistic, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and prevalence of misclassification of frailty. Patient characteristics associated with misclassification were determined using Fisher's exact tests, t-tests, or median tests. RESULTS: Older age (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.36, 95%CI:1.11-1.68, P = 0.003 per 5-years older) and comorbidity (aOR = 1.49, 95%CI:1.27-1.75, P < 0.001 per additional comorbidity) were associated with greater likelihood of nephrologist-perceived frailty. Being non-African American was associated with greater likelihood of NP- (aOR = 5.51, 95%CI:3.21-9.48, P = 0.003) and patient- (aOR = 4.20, 95%CI:1.61-10.9, P = 0.003) perceived frailty. Percent agreement between perceived and measured frailty was poor (nephrologist, NP, and patient: 64.1%, 67.0%, and 55.5%). Among non-frail participants, 34.4%, 30.0%, and 31.6% were perceived as frail by a nephrologist, NP, or themselves. Older adults (P < 0.001) were more likely to be misclassified as frail by a nephrologist; women (P = 0.04) and non-African Americans (P = 0.02) were more likely to be misclassified by an NP. Neither age, sex, nor race was associated with patient misclassification. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived frailty is an inadequate proxy for measured frailty among patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Focus groups were used to examine the reasons for and content of diabetes care management, the challenges faced, and the support services needed. METHODS: Five focus groups were conducted with family caregivers from six tribes. Caregivers' responses related to care management were identified and categorized into themes. RESULTS: Participants reported that they provided assistance with a wide range of diabetes care tasks (e.g., skin and wound care, in-home dialysis) depending on the elder's level of impairment. Caregivers described three major challenges related to diabetes care management: (1) anxiety about in-home care, (2) coping with psychosocial issues, and (3) decision making and communication problems with other family members. They emphasized the importance of developing a care routine for successful diabetes management. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, we suggest areas where diabetes educators can assist American Indian family caregivers in meeting the needs of frail elders in the home.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: For the large and growing population of elderly patients with cardiovascular disease, it is important to identify clinically relevant measures of biological age and their contribution to risk. Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine denoting increased vulnerability and decreased physiological reserves. We analyzed the manner in which the variable frailty predicts short-term outcomes for elderly non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients aged >/= 75 years, with diagnosed non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were included at 3 centers, and clinical data including judgment of frailty were collected prospectively. Frailty was defined according to the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale. The impact of the comorbid conditions on risk was quantified by the coronary artery disease-specific index. Of 307 patients, 149 (48.5%) were considered frail. By multiple logistic regression, frailty was found to be strongly and independently associated with risk for the primary composite outcome (death from any cause, myocardial reinfarction, revascularization due to ischemia, hospitalization for any cause, major bleeding, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and need for dialysis up to 1 month after inclusion) (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.7), in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-16.8), and 1-month mortality (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-13.0). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is strongly and independently associated with in-hospital mortality, 1-month mortality, prolonged hospital care, and the primary composite outcome. The combined use of frailty and comorbidity may constitute an ultimate risk prediction concept in regard to cardiovascular patients with complex needs.

N2  - BACKGROUND Anticoagulation is often avoided in patients with atrial
fibrillation who are at an increased risk of falling.
OBJECTIVES This study assessed the relative efficacy and safety of
edoxaban versus warfarin in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective
Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial
Fibrillation-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) trial in patients
with atrial fibrillation judged to be at increased risk of falling.
METHODS We performed a pre-specified analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48,
comparing patients with versus without increased risk of falling.
RESULTS Nine hundred patients (4.3%) were judged to be at increased
risk of falling. These patients were older (median, 77 vs. 72 years; p <
0.001), and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities including prior
stroke/transient ischemic attack, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.
After multivariable adjustment, patients at increased risk of falling
experienced more bone fractures caused by falling (adjusted hazard ratio
{[}HRadj]: 1.88; 95% confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.49 to 2.38; p <
0.001), major bleeding (HRadj: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.64; p = 0.023),
life-threatening bleeding (HRadj: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.50; p =
0.013), and all-cause death (HRadj: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.70; p <
0.001), but not ischemic events including stroke/systemic embolic event
(HRadj: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.51; p = 0.27). No treatment interaction
was observed between either dosing regimens of edoxaban and warfarin for
the efficacy and safety outcomes. Treatment with edoxaban resulted in a
greater absolute risk reduction in severe bleeding events and all-cause
mortality compared with warfarin.
CONCLUSIONS Edoxaban is an attractive alternative to warfarin in
patients at increased risk of falling, because it is associated with an
even greater absolute reduction in severe bleeding events and mortality.

N1  - a review in which Makary article didn't measure frailty in CKD patients
.
Frailty has been shown by Makary and colleagues to be a risk factor for postoperative complications (odds ratio [OR] 2.54; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-5.77), prolonged hospital stay (OR 1.69; 95% CI = 1.28-2.23) and discharge to a skilled nursing facility (OR 20.48; 95% CI = 5.54-75.68). In the renal population, McAdams-Demarco and colleagues 12 showed that frailty is 5× higher in hemodialysis patients than in the community-dwelling older adults. The same author went on to show that in kidney transplant recipients, the presence of frailty was associated with early hospital readmission within 30 days of kidney transplant discharge (45.8% vs 28%, p = .005) 13 and with mortality, whereby frail recipients had a 2.17-fold increased mortality compared to non-frail recipients (95% CI = 1.01-4.65). 14 Interestingly, this association was not due to age alone as younger, frail patients also had higher mortality compared to their non-frail counterparts. Although these data do not address the question of whether frail patients should remain on dialysis or be transplanted, it does highlight the need to risk stratify and possibly optimize the functional status of transplant candidate especially elderly ESRD patients before transplantation. Studies are needed to address whether improvement in frailty improves transplant outcomes.
N2  - Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

N2  - The EVEREST II trial investigated the MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Menlo Park, CA) in patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing surgical procedures. Although mitral stenosis was not reported in this cohort, this trial excluded patients receiving dialysis. We report a case of a 43-year-old HIV-positive, dialysis-dependent patient with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and severe MR, who was considered at high operative risk because of frailty. She was treated with a MitraClip as part of the REALISM high-risk registry. Her symptomatic MR improved but severe symptomatic mitral stenosis developed 28 months after the MitraClip procedure. At that point, she was felt to be a better operative candidate but required open mitral valve replacement. Pathologic examination demonstrated significant calcification of the leaflets around the MitraClip devices.

outcomes of frailty
N2  - Consequences of aging are gaining clinical relevance. In transplantation, aging and immunosenescence impact treatment and outcomes. The impact of aging, however, will critically depend on distinguishing healthy, chronological aging from biological aging that may result into frailty. Approximately 15% of individuals older than 65 years are frail, and it is expected that this condition will gain more clinical relevance with an expected increase to greater than 20% over the next 5 years. Clearly, frailty impacts various general aspects of health care and organ transplantation in particular including patient selection, waitlist management and treatment after transplantation. In general, frailty has been characterized by a compromised physiological reserve and an augmented vulnerability. In comparison to healthy aging, inflammatory markers and cytokines are increased in frail older adults. Thus, modifications of the immune response, in addition to physical limitations and changes of metabolism, are likely to impact outcomes after transplantation. Here, we provide a risk assessment of frailty at the time of transplant evaluation and review effects on outcomes and recovery after transplantation. Moreover, we summarize our current understanding of the pathophysiology of frailty and consequences on immune responses and metabolism.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The ability of nursing home residents to function independently is associated with their quality of life. The impact of amputations on functional status in this population remains unclear. This analysis evaluated the effect of amputations-transmetatarsal (TM), below-knee (BK), and above-knee (AK)--on the ability of residents to perform self-care activities. METHODS: Medicare inpatient claims were linked with nursing home assessment data to identify admissions for amputation. The Minimum Data Set Activities of Daily Living Long Form Score (0-28; higher numbers indicating greater impairment), based on seven activities of daily living, was calculated before and after amputation. Hierarchical modeling determined the effect of the surgery on postamputation function of residents. Controlling for comorbidity, cognition, and prehospital function allowed for evaluation of Activities of Daily Living trajectories over time. RESULTS: In total, 4965 residents underwent amputation: 490 TM, 1596 BK, and 2879 AK. Mean age was 81 years, and 54% of the patients were women. Most were white (67%) or black (26.5%). Comorbidities before amputation included diabetes mellitus (70.7%), coronary heart disease (57.1%), chronic kidney disease (53.6%), and/or congestive heart failure (52.1%). Mortality within 30 days of hospital discharge was 9.0%, and hospital readmission was 27.7%. Stroke, end-stage renal disease, and poor baseline cognitive function were associated with the poorest functional outcome after amputation. Compared with residents who received TM amputation, those who had BK or AK amputation recovered more slowly and failed to return to baseline function by 6 months. BK was found to have a superior functional trajectory compared with AK. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly nursing home residents undergoing BK or AK amputation failed to return to their functional baseline within 6 months. Among frail elderly nursing home residents, higher amputation level, stroke, end-stage renal disease, poor baseline cognitive scores, and female sex were associated with inferior functional status after amputation. These factors should be strongly assessed to maintain activities of daily living and quality of life in the nursing home population.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Elderly patients are the largest and fastest growing group of patients with chronic kidney disease maintained on dialysis in the world. Because of advanced age and a heavy burden of comorbidities, the elderly are usually not candidates for kidney transplantation and are less likely to be offered peritoneal dialysis (PD). There is, however, growing evidence that the use of community nurses to assist with PD and the introduction of programs for assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) targeting these frail, elderly patients may enable more elderly patients to have their PD treatment at home. Suitable candidates for aPD are incident end-stage kidney disease patients preferring PD but unable to perform their own treatment because of comorbidities, physical disabilities, or psychosocial problems; prevalent, previous autonomous PD patients who have lost their independence because of advanced age or an increased burden of comorbidities; or prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients switched from HD to aPD because of their own preference, failure of vascular access for HD, or an inability to tolerate HD. We believe that aPD in the future will prove to be a safe and feasible complementary alternative to in-center HD for the growing group of frail, elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease.

N2  - Aging is an important risk factor for patients with atrial fibrillation. The estimated prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients aged >/=80 years is 9-10%, and is associated with a four to five fold increased risk of embolic stroke, and with an estimated increased stroke risk of 1.45-fold per decade in aging. Older age is also associated with an increased risk of major bleeding with oral anticoagulant therapy. This review will focus on the role of oral anticoagulation with new oral anticoagulants, non-vitamin K antagonist in populations with common comorbid conditions, including age, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, on multiple medication, and frailty. In patients 75 years and older, randomised trials have shown new oral anticoagulants to be as effective as warfarin, or in some cases superior, with an overall better safety profile, consistently reducing rates of intracranial haemorrhages. Prior to considering oral anticoagulant therapy in an elderly frail patient, a comprehensive assessment should be performed to include the risks and benefits, stroke risk, baseline kidney function, cognitive status, mobility and fall risk, multiple medication, nutritional status assessment, and life expectancy.

N2  - In studies of functional status decline in older persons, the strategy for handling deaths during follow-up may influence policy implications. We compared 301 older ESRD dialysis patients with 322 controls to determine whether functional decline over 3 years among dialysis patients exceeded that of "normal aging." We used two different statistical methods and, for each, compared results when deaths were excluded and then included in the analysis. Dialysis patients incurred a larger follow-up mortality rate and were more impaired at baseline. Findings based on functional transition over time, assessed by a nominal variable, were sensitive to whether or not deaths were included in the analysis. However, findings based on nonparametric methods for an ordinal scale (functional impairment) were not sensitive to whether or not deaths were included in the analysis. Analyzing data with and without deceased subjects may be the most comprehensive approach to comparing two cohorts over time.

N2  - Background. Falls among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have significant consequences for quality of life and functional independence, morbidity, healthcare utilization and even mortality, but studies on the etiology of falls within large HD cohorts are limited. Methods. Falls during the past 12 months were ascertained for a prevalent multi-center HD cohort (n = 762) aged 20-92 years, and associations with demographic and treatment characteristics, co-morbidities, cognitive function, prescribed medications, balance tests, frailty and depressive symptoms were assessed. Results. Falls were sustained by 28.4% of participants. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, participants classified as frail were over two times more likely to report falls [odds ratio (OR): 2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-4.71, P = 0.01], and participants with a CES-D score 18+ and/or prescribed antidepressants were over 80% more likely to be fallers (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.23-2.74, P = 0.003) than were participants with a CES-D score <18 and no prescribed antidepressants. Conclusions. Frailty and depressed mood, factors that are potentially modifiable, are prominently associated with falls.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide is rising markedly becoming a priority public health problem. The progression of CKD cause functional limitation and severe disability with poor quality of life. The aim of present review was to highlight the effect of rehabilitation in CKD and ESRD subjects. The rehabilitative process is unique in treating disabled people according to a holistic approach with the aim of supporting a person's independent living and autonomy. CKD are associated with an increased risk of functional impairment, independent of age, gender, and co-morbidities. Clinicians should counsel patients with CKD including frail elder people to increase physical activity levels and target that regular physical activity including aerobic or endurance exercises training benefits health. In old subjects with CKD and multiple functional impairments, the traditional disease based model should be changed to individualized patient-centered approach that prioritizes patient preferences. Patients receiving haemodialysis have a considerably lower exercise tolerance, functional capacity, and more muscle wasting than healthy subjects or patients with less severe CKD. Exercise training or comprehensive multi-dimensional strategy and goal-oriented intervention should be also provided in ESRD older subjects. Structured prevention programs based on reducing the risk factors for CKD and rehabilitative strategies could reduce disability occurrence.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - The incidence of psychopathology, particularly depression, is high in dialysed elderly patients whereas their perceived level of health in the mental domain is similar to that of a non-dialysed and, even younger, population. Although the losses associated with advancing years, chronic disease and then entry into dialysis renders the psyche of elderly people frail, they do not strictly add in negative terms: their psychological reserve or resignation helps very elderly people to tolerate dialysis and its constraints. However, maintaining functional autonomy (ability to provide for one's fundamental needs and preserve leisure activities) while remaining independent to take decisions (particularly in controlling ways of receiving assistance) and preserving close relationships emerge as major determinant factors of the quality of life of very elderly dialysed patients. Added to the dependency due to dialysis, losses in these domains very often represent a turning point by changing the patient's identity, predisposing to the development of relationship problems, leading the patient to question his self-esteem or even resulting in psychological dependency, which itself adversely affects the quality of life. These mechanisms of psychopathology may not hide the possibility of an underlying dementia.

N2  - Background: The burden of chronic kidney disease is highest among older
adults but the significance of a diminished level of kidney function in
this heterogeneous population is poorly understood. We sought to examine
the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and
objective physical performance in older adults.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 4,562 participants from The Irish
Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a national cohort of community-dwelling
adults aged >= 50 years. We used multivariable linear or quantile
regression to model the association between categories of cystatin C
(eGFR(cys)) or creatinine eGFR (eGFR(cr)) and the following outcomes:
gait speed, timed-up-and-go (TUG) and grip strength. Relationships were
further explored using natural eGFR splines. We examined effect
modification by age in the relationship between eGFR and gait speed.
Results: Mean (SD) age was 61.8 (8.3) years, 53.6% were female and
median (IQR) eGFR(cys) was 82 (70-94) mL/min/1.73m(2). In
multivariable-adjusted models, participants in the lowest eGFR(cys)
category (< 45 mL/min/1.73m(2)) had 3.32 cm/s (95% confidence interval
{[}95% CI] 0.02-6.62) slower mean gait speed, 1.32 kg (95% CI
0.20-2.44) lower mean grip strength, and 0.31 seconds (95% CI -0.04 to
0.65) longer median TUG versus the reference group (eGFR(cys) >= 90
mL/min/1.73m(2)). The relationship between eGFR(cys) and outcomes
appeared linear but varied by age. The association between eGFR(cr) and
outcomes tended towards a U-shape.
Conclusions: Cystatin C eGFR was linearly related to poorer physical
performance beyond middle age among community-dwelling adults. The
non-linear relationships observed with eGFR(cr) underscore the
limitations of creatinine as a predictor of frailty outcomes in older
individuals.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Thus, although the prognosis for small vessel vasculitis affecting the kidney has improved from almost inevitable death 30 years ago, through a 30-35% 5-year survival 10-15 years ago, many problems remain. Although it seems likely that the more intense immunosuppression used in most units over the past 10-15 years has improved immediate survival, a number of these elderly and often frail patients die directly as a result of these treatment regimens; in our present series, 5/16 deaths (31%) could be related directly to immunosuppression. In some patients extrarenal complications of the vasculitis, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, still may lead to early death. The relative roles (if any) of methylprednisolone and/or plasma exchange in treatment of renal vasculitis are not clear yet, although a recent controlled trial in patients with crescentic nephritis, mainly the result of small vessel renal vasculitis, showed a modest benefit from plasma exchange in addition to prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, but only in those patients requiring dialysis. In the longer term, we do not know for how long, with what agent and with what intensity immunosuppression must be maintained. In our series, in which most patients were maintained on modest immunosuppression for many years, relapse of the vasculitis was almost absent, suggesting some merit in this strategy. We used azathioprine rather than intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide, as others have advocated; there are no data to choose between these regimens at the moment, although even in this relatively elderly population long-term oral cyclophosphamide is better avoided because of risks to the bladder, gonadal toxicity and oncogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

N2  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/1.73 m(2) ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level, and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: >/=60.0 (normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) . Frailty status was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss. Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty. RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2) ) were more frail (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition, individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.13-14.1) CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults.

N2  - Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition) due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition, comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3-5 now affects 8.5% of adults in the United  Kingdom; with 4% of patients expected to reach stage 5 CKD. Increasing numbers of older patients are contributing to the growth of demand of kidney services. With the exception of transplantation, dialysis has been the main form of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for advanced CKD. This elderly population is usually too frail and has many other co-existing medical complaints or co morbidities to undergo transplantation. Dialysis is an invasive treatment, and some frail elderly patients can experience many dialysis related symptoms. An alternative option for these patients is to choose conservative management (CM) of their stage 5 CKD. These patients often have complex supportive and palliative care needs. The frequency, severity and distress caused by symptoms related to stage 5 CKD are often under recognized and under treated. There is a need for early identification and management of symptoms as they present in patients with stage 5 CKD being managed conservatively. Symptom assessment should be focused on anticipating, identifying and alleviating any symptoms. This needs to be incorporated into the regular practice of those managing CM patients.

N2  - In diabetes-related amputations, the risk of nonhealing or infection of a wound and the need for revision are increased. Medical treatment before amputation should optimize general and local conditions including the regression of edema, the control of infection, and the optimization of glucoregulation. A major argument for foot-sparing surgery is the poor functional recovery after major limb amputation. Diabetic patients are frail, with an increased postoperative morbidity and mortality after major amputation. Factors detrimental to functional outcome are advanced age, end-stage renal disease, dementia, and above-knee amputation. A multidisciplinary approach is required to optimize the results of diabetes-related amputations. The authors discuss medical and technical aspects that may reduce the failure of minor or major diabetes-related amputations. Copyright © 2008 by Elsevier Inc.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - OBJECTIVES: In elderly hemodialysis patients, protein-energy wasting is associated with poor outcome; however, the association between body mass index (BMI) changes over time, and survival has been seldom studied in this particularly frail population. DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study recruited 502 hemodialysis patients aged >/=75 years from the French cohort ARNOS and followed them from 2005 to 2009. BMI changes over time were modeled by individual linear regression models. Survival analyses used frailty Cox models. RESULTS: The population average age was 80.9 years. Forty-one percent of the patients died during follow-up. A 1 kg/m(2) lower baseline BMI was associated with a 4% increase in the risk of death over the study period (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [1.01-1.08], P = .02). A 5% BMI loss per year was associated with a 52% increase in the risk of death (HR 1.52, 95% confidence interval [1.32-1.75], P < .001). In patients who lost weight (>5% BMI loss per year), the lower was the baseline BMI, the higher was the HR for death. There was a similar trend in the patients with stable weight (5% BMI loss-5% BMI gain per year). In patients who gained weight, the HR was unexpectedly higher than in those with stable weight. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly hemodialysis patients, the impact of the BMI percent change on survival was stronger than that of the baseline BMI. Patients with stable weight had longer survivals than patients who lost or gained weight. Thus, in this population, BMI changes should be regularly assessed. Further studies should assess the safety of weight gain strategies.

The proportion with hospitalizations was 24.4% for non‐frail, 33.0% for pre‐frail and 48.4% for frail (P&lt; 0.001). On univariate analysis, pre‐frail and frail patients were as 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07 to 1.78) and 2.4 (95% CI 1.86 to 3.07) times as more likely to be hospitalized, respectively. Frail phenotype remained significantly associated with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 1.80; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.3) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.
N2  - Introduction and Aims: Frailty is a distinct clinical syndrome beyond just being old and ultimately results in increased risk for disability, hospitalization, and death. Interestingly, it has been reported that frailty is more common and appears even in early stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and much younger population of this group compared to the general population. We investigated the prevalence, correlates of frailty and the association of frailty with hospitalization‐free survival among clinically stable patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD). Methods: Between July 2012 and December 2012, we recruited study subjects according to the inclusion criteria as follows: (1) age of 20 years or older, (2) at least 6 months or longer on dialysis, (3) no hospitalization for the last 3 months, except for vascular access problem in case of MHD patients, (4) ambulatory patients with or without assistive device, (5) cognitive enough to answer the questionnaires without help from others, and (6) gave informed consent without proxy and finally followed 1,658 patients ( MHD =1,255 and CPD = 403) until August 2014. We adopted frailty phenotype composed of the following components; 1) unintentional weight loss more than 4.5 Kg or 5% of the previous body weight for the last 1 year, 2) physical inactivity, 3) RAND‐36 physical function (PF) scale <75 and vitality scale <55 as surrogates for weakness/slowness and exhaustion, respectively. Low PF scale was scored as 2 points and other components as 1 point for each. Those with 0, 1‐2 and 3 or more points were considered as non‐frail, pre‐frail and frail, respectively. Demographic data were obtained by review of medical records. Blood chemistry data used were the values averaged over the three consecutive routine checkup. Results: The 1,658 participants evaluated were 55.9 +/‐12.9 years of age (mean +/‐ SD) on dialysis for 5.2+/‐4.5 years; 55.7% were male and 39.4% were diabetes. Frail subjects were 577 (34.8 %) and 757 (45.7%) were pre‐frail. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female sex, unemployed status, older age, higher body mass index, lower education level, lower TIBC and comorbid conditions were independently associated with frailty. During the 86 weeks follow‐up period, 608 patients were hospitalized. The proportion with hospitalizations was 24.4% for non‐frail, 33.0% for pre‐frail and 48.4% for frail (P< 0.001). On univariate analysis, pre‐frail and frail patients were as 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07 to 1.78) and 2.4 (95% CI 1.86 to 3.07) times as more likely to be hospitalized, respectively. Frail phenotype remained significantly associated with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 1.80; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.3) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Conclusions: Frailty phenotype was very common and significant predictor of hospitalization‐free survival even in a relatively healthy patients receiving chronic dialysis. More studies are necessary for preventing or attenuating frailty in the chronic dialysis patients.

N2  - Older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience functional impairment that can complicate CKD management. Failure to recognize functional impairment may put these individuals at risk of further functional decline, nursing home placement, and missed opportunities for timely goals-of-care conversations. Routine geriatric assessment could be a useful tool for identifying older adults with CKD who are at risk of functional decline and provide contextual information to guide clinical decision-making. Two innovative programs were implemented in the Veterans Health Administration that incorporate geriatric assessment into a nephrology visit. In one program, a geriatrician embedded in a nephrology clinic used standardized geriatric assessment tools with individuals with CKD aged 70 and older (Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment for CKD) (CGA-4-CKD). In the second program, a nephrology clinic used comprehensive appointments for individuals aged 75 and older to conduct geriatric assessments and CKD care (Renal Silver). Data on 68 veterans who had geriatric assessments through these programs between November 2013 and May 2015 are reported. In CGA-4-CKD, difficulty with one or more activities of daily living (ADLs), history of falls, and cognitive impairment were each found in 27.3% of participants. ADL difficulty was found in 65.7%, falls in 28.6%, and cognitive impairment in 51.6% of participants in Renal Silver. Geriatric assessment guided care processes in 45.4% (n = 15) of veterans in the CGA-4-CKD program and 37.1% (n = 13) of those in Renal Silver. Findings suggest there is a significant burden of functional impairment in older adults with CKD. Knowledge of this impairment is applicable to CKD management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The number of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease opting for conservative management rather than dialysis is unknown but likely to be growing as increasingly frail patients with advanced renal disease present to renal services. Conservative kidney management includes ongoing medical input and support from a multidisciplinary team. There is limited evidence concerning patient and carer experience of this choice. This study will explore quality of life, symptoms, cognition, frailty, performance decision making, costs and impact on carers in people with advanced chronic kidney disease managed without dialysis and is funded by the National Institute of Health Research in the UK. METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, longitudinal study, patients will be recruited in the UK, by renal research nurses, once they have made the decision not to embark on dialysis. Carers will be asked to 'opt-in' with consent from patients. The approach includes longitudinal quantitative surveys of quality of life, symptoms, decision making and costs for patients and quality of life and costs for carers, with questionnaires administered quarterly over 12 months. Additionally, the decision making process will be explored via qualitative interviews with renal physicians/clinical nurse specialists. DISCUSSION: The study is designed to capture patient and carer profiles when conservative kidney management is implemented, and understand trajectories of care-receiving and care-giving with the aim of optimising palliative care for this population. It will explore the interactions that lead to clinical care decisions and the impact of these decisions on informal carers with the intention of improving clinical outcomes for patients and the experiences of care givers.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: The dialysis population is aging worldwide. It is well known that patients on dialysis have limited functional status, but only recently has frailty been considered. SUMMARY: The prevalence of frailty among patients on dialysis ranges from 3.4- to 10-fold higher than among community-dwelling elderly, depending on the method of assessing frailty and patient characteristics. Despite its high prevalence and the high overall mortality in the dialysis population, frailty is associated with higher mortality, independent of clinical and demographic characteristics and comorbidity. The prevalence of frailty among patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also high, and cross-sectional data suggest that the prevalence may increase as CKD progresses. Thus, interventions to improve frailty have the potential to improve quality of life and mortality. Although interventions to improve physical dysfunction have been successful in the population with end-stage renal disease, no studies have specifically targeted frail individuals. Therefore, the extent to which exercise or physical activity interventions are feasible among frail patients and can improve frailty urgently needs to be examined. In the meantime, providers should refer frail patients to physical therapists and encourage them to be more active if possible. In addition, more attention should be focused on the possibility that rehabilitation among patients with earlier stages of CKD could improve dialysis outcomes. KEY MESSAGES: Frailty is extremely common among patients on dialysis and is independently associated with adverse outcomes. Providers should take advantage of available resources to improve functioning in this population, and research should address the optimal strategy for addressing frailty, including timing of intervention.

This is despite the fact that clinical outcome studies show that older patients cope at least as well as younger patients with PD, and that many older patients do not cope well with hemodialysis (HD). Barriers to PD include medical and social factors, physician bias, late referral, and education not tailored to the needs of older patients. The development of assisted PD can overcome some of the barriers and enable frail older patients to have home-based dialysis treatment.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative  (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation, Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease (CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis) and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the oldest old with CKD.

N2  - Background: Kidney transplantation (KT) candidates often present with multiple comorbidities. These patients also have a substantial burden of frailty, which is also associated with increased mortality. However, it is unknown if frailty is merely a surrogate for comorbidity, itself an independent domain of risk, or if frailty and comorbidity have differential effects. Better understanding the interplay between these 2 constructs will improve clinical decision making in KT candidates.; Objective: To test whether comorbidity is equally associated with waitlist mortality among frail and nonfrail KT candidates and to test whether measuring both comorbidity burden and frailty improves mortality risk prediction.; Methods: We studied 2,086 candidates on the KT waitlist (November 2009 - October 2017) in a multicenter cohort study, in whom frailty and comorbidity were measured at evaluation. We quantified the association between Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) adapted for end-stage renal disease and waitlist mortality using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model and tested whether this association differed between frail and nonfrail candidates.; Results: At evaluation, 18.1% of KT candidates were frail and 51% had a high comorbidity burden (CCI score ≥2). Candidates with a high comorbidity burden were at 1.38-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.89) increased risk of waitlist mortality. However, this association differed by frailty status (p for interaction = 0.01): among nonfrail candidates, a high comorbidity burden was associated with a 1.66-fold (95% CI 1.17-2.35) increased mortality risk; among frail candidates, here was no statistically significant association (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.44-1.29). Adding this interaction between comorbidity and frailty to a mortality risk estimation model significantly improved prediction, increasing the c-statistic from 0.640 to 0.656 (p < 0.001).; Conclusions: Nonfrail candidates with a high comorbidity burden at KT evaluation have an increased risk of waitlist mortality. Importantly, comorbidity is less of a concern in already high-risk patients who are frail.; © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - In diabetes-related amputations, the risk of nonhealing or infection of a wound and the need for revision are increased. Medical treatment before amputation should optimize general and local conditions including the regression of edema, the control of infection, and the optimization of glucoregulation. A major argument for foot-sparing surgery is the poor functional recovery after major limb amputation. Diabetic patients are frail, with an increased postoperative morbidity and mortality after major amputation. Factors detrimental to functional outcome are advanced age, end-stage renal disease, dementia, and above-knee amputation. A multidisciplinary approach is required to optimize the results of diabetes-related amputations. The authors discuss medical and technical aspects that may reduce the failure of minor or major diabetes-related amputations.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Because of conflicting results in observational studies, it is still subject to debate whether in diabetic patients the dialysis modality selected as first treatment (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) may have a major impact on outcomes. We therefore aimed at performing a systematic review of the available evidence. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched until February 2014 for English-language articles without time or methodology restrictions by highly sensitive search strategies focused on diabetes, end-stage kidney disease and dialysis modality. Selection of relevant studies, data extraction and analysis were performed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Twenty-five observational studies (23 on incident and 2 on prevalent cohorts) were included in this review. Mortality was the only main outcome addressed in large cohorts. When considering patient survival, results were inconsistent and varied across study designs, follow-up period and subgroups. We therefore found no evidence-based arguments in favour or against a particular dialysis modality as first choice treatment in patients with diabetes and ESKD. However, peritoneal dialysis (PD) as first choice seems to convey a higher risk of death in elderly and frail patients. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence derived from observational studies is inconsistent. Therefore evidence-based arguments indicating that HD or PD as first treatment may improve patient-centred outcomes in diabetics with ESKD are lacking. In the absence of such evidence, modality selection should be governed by patient preference, after unbiased patient information.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - As the aging of the population progresses in Japan, the nutritional problems in dialysis patients are being highlighted. Frailty is a clinical concept including body weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigability, decreased walking speed, and decreased physical activity, which means an intermediate concept between healthy subjects and disability subjects, indicating that their activities of daily living are not decreased but they cannot smoothly perform housework or exercise. Morbidity of dialysis patients is known to be high, and mortality of dialysis patients with frailty is 3 times higher. Sarcopenia is one of the principal reasons for or triggers of frailty. It is a disease setting showing decreased muscle volume and quality associated with decreased physical function or quality of life. Recent mean age at dialysis therapy induction is getting near to 70 years old in Japan. Japanese dialysis patients who are elderly and present organ failure would have a double risk for sarcopenia. Patients with advanced stages of CKD are generally given protein diet, and it has been reported that a low protein intake in dialysis patients would be a significant risk for developing sarcopenia and increasing mortality. Recently, the focus has been on protein energy wasting (PEW) - an underlying disease condition in sarcopenia or frailty. PEW is an energy wasting condition occurring in dialysis patients, and the cause of PEW is principally decreased food intake and increased catabolism. It has recently been revealed that decreased protein intake would be a risk factor for increased mortality in dialysis patients. The incidence of PEW in dialysis patients is reported to be 14%. To avoid sarcopenia and PEW leading to frailty, we should pay much more attention to an appropriate protein and calorie intake rather than restriction in dialysis patients.

frailty assessments as independent variables; dialysis complications (serum albumin) as dependent variables.
N2  - AIM: Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on its impact on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these patients has not been attempted before. METHODS: A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural centre was recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered to these patients. Clinical and dialysis-related laboratory parameters were collected. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis complications were performed, and variables demonstrating significant correlations were entered into multivariate regression models to determine their independent associations. RESULTS: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire showed significant association with each other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher Liu's comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and creatinine levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The other five questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis identified an independently negative association between serum albumin and the simple FRAIL scale results (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: This is the first study establishing the utility of different self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a closer relationship with dialysis-related complications.

DT score association
N2  - BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness is a risk factor for mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Muscle strength measurements are routinely used as a screening tool but depend on patient cooperation and motivation. We wished to determine whether measuring maximal voluntary muscle strength was affected by patient self-reported distress. METHODS: We measured pinch strength (PS) and handgrip strength (HGS) in 382 adult HD patients with a corresponding self-reported distress thermometer (DT) scores. Postdialysis body composition measurements were made using multifrequency bioelectrical assessments and patients assessed for frailty. RESULTS: Mean age was 66.4 +/- 14.9 years, with 238 males (62%), 48% diabetic, and dialysis vintage 36 (15-75) months. The mean DT score was 4.4 +/- 3.3, with a frailty score of 4.6 +/- 1.5. On multivariable analysis, DT scores were associated with frailty (beta = 0.35, P = .003), prescription of aspirin for cardiac disease (beta = 1.0, P = .004), lean body mass (beta = 0.04, P = .004), and negatively with age (beta = -0.05, P < .001), hematocrit (beta = -8.2, P = .004), and maximum PS (beta = -1.4, P = .003). CONCLUSION: Paradoxically higher self-reported DT scores were associated with younger age and lean body mass. As such, younger healthier, rather than more comorbid, patients may have greater expectations for their health and therefore report more distress. We found no association between DT scores and HGS, and as such, although HGS is a voluntary test, it appears to be a robust test independent of patient stresses. However, PS was lower in patients with higher DT scores, and as such, greater care may be required in interpreting these measurements.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk of developing aging-related problems, such as frailty, impaired physical function, falls, poor nutrition and cognitive impairment. These factors affect dialysis outcomes, which can be very poor in frail, elderly patients who often experience a decline in overall health and physical function and have short survival. The default treatment option for these patients is hospital-based hemodialysis, often with little consideration of how this modality will affect the survival or quality of life of individual patients. A comparison of quality of life of elderly patients on hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis shows that those on peritoneal dialysis have less illness intrusion. Assisted peritoneal dialysis enables a greater number of frail, elderly patients to have dialysis in their own homes. Dialysis may not extend survival for those with multiple comorbidities, so conservative care (nondialysis treatment) should be considered. To improve the outcomes of elderly patients with ESRD, it is necessary to develop a realistic approach to overall prognosis, quality of life and how the patient copes with the disabilities associated with aging. This approach includes having discussions regarding choice of treatment and end-of-life goals with patients and families.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - In the last decade, an increasing number of patients over 75 years of age are starting renal replacement therapy. Frailty is highly prevalent in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the context of the increased prevalence of some ESRD-associated conditions: protein-energy wasting, inflammation, anaemia, acidosis or hormonal disturbances. There are currently no hard data to support guidance on the optimal duration of dialysis for frail/elderly ESRD patients. The current debate is not about starting dialysis or managing conservatory frail ESRD patients, but whether a more intensive regimen once dialysis is initiated (for whatever reasons and circumstances) would improve patients' outcome. The most important issue is that all studies performed with extended/alternative dialysis regimens do not specifically address this particular type of patients and therefore all the inferences are derived from the general ESRD population. Care planning should be responsive to end-of-life needs whatever the treatment modality. Care in this setting should focus on symptom control and quality of life rather than life extension. We conclude that, similar to the general dialysed population, extensive application of more intensive dialysis schedules is not based on solid evidence. However, after a thorough clinical evaluation, a limited period of a trial of intensive dialysis could be prescribed in more problematic patients.

N2  - Bisphosphonates are widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis and
are generally well tolerated. However, the United States Food and Drug
Administration safety reports have highlighted the issue of renal safety
in bisphosphonate-treated patients. All bisphosphonates carry labeled
warnings or a contraindication for use in patients with severe renal
impairment (creatinine clearance <30 or <35mL/min). Data from pivotal
trials and their extension studies of bisphosphonates approved for the
management of osteoporosis were obtained via PubMed, and were reviewed
with support from published articles available on PubMed. Renal safety
analyses of pivotal trials of oral alendronate, risedronate, and
ibandronate for postmenopausal osteoporosis showed no short-term or
long-term effects on renal function. Transient postinfusion increases in
serum creatinine have been reported in patients receiving intravenous
ibandronate and zoledronic acid; however, studies showed that treatment
with these agents did not result in long-term renal function
deterioration in clinical trial patients with osteoporosis. All
bisphosphonate therapies have warnings for use in patients with severe
renal impairment. Clinical trial results have shown that even in
elderly, frail, osteoporotic patients with renal impairment, intravenous
bisphosphonate therapy administration in accordance with the prescribing
information did not result in long-term renal function decline.
Physicians should follow guidelines for bisphosphonate therapies
administration at all times. (c) 2013 American Society for Bone and

N2  - Intradialytic hypotensive episodes are deleterious for hemodialysis (HD)
patients. Acetate-free biofiltration with profiled potassium (AFBK)
dialysate concentration may improve their cardiovascular stability. The
aim of the present crossover study was to compare intradialytic
hemodynamic tolerance and biological parameters between online
hemodiafiltration (olHDF) and AFBK. Ten frail HD patients (8 males) with
a mean age of 66.71- 12.31 years were studied for three months on olHDF
and AFBK. There was a significant reduction of the hypotensive episodes
during the AFBK period compared to the olHDF period. Mean intradialytic
systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly higher during
the AFBK period. There was a significant postdialytic increase in serum
sodium concentration with the AFBK compared to olHDF. The dry weight and
ultrafiltration indices were significantly higher, and the Kt/V was
significantly lower during the AFBK period. Serum albumin concentration

significantly improved intradialytic tolerance in hemodynamically

N2  - Frail elderly patients with advanced kidney disease experience many of the burdens associated with dialysis. Although these patients constitute the fastest-growing population starting dialysis, they often suffer loss of functional status, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality after dialysis initiation. Nephrology clinicians face the challenges of helping patients decide if the potential benefits of dialysis outweigh the risks and preparing such patients for future setbacks. A communication framework for dialysis decision-making that aligns treatment choices with patient goals and values is presented. The role of uncertainty is highlighted, and the concept of a goal-directed care plan is introduced. This plan incorporates a time-limited trial that promotes frequent opportunities for reassessment. Using the communication skills presented, the clinician can prepare and guide patients for the dialysis trajectory as it unfolds.

N2  - Sarcopenia is defined as the presence of low muscle mass and either decreased muscle strength or function. It is increasingly becoming a significant cause of frailty, loss of independence and physical disability in ageing western populations. Recent experimental evidence has revealed that skeletal muscle is particularly susceptible to damaging molecules that result in oxidative stress and that oxidative stress plays a prominent role in the development and progression of sarcopenia. The investigators have previously shown that the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol is able to abolish vascular oxidative stress and improve endothelial function in cohorts such as optimally treated chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Recently, the investigators have also shown that allopurinol improves exercise tolerance and time to ST‐depression in optimally treated coronary artery disease, suggesting that allopurinol could also exert its effects through ATP and/or oxygen sparing mechanisms. Therefore, we propose a randomised double blind placebo‐controlled parallel group trial of allopurinol in patients with primary sarcopenia using MR‐spectroscopy and Flow Mediated Dilatation to investigate the possible mechanisms that underlie this exciting possibility

N2  - PURPOSE: This qualitative study investigated diabetes care management among family members of American Indian elders with self-care limitations. Focus groups were used to examine the reasons for and content of diabetes care management, the challenges faced, and the support services needed. METHODS: Five focus groups were conducted with family caregivers from six tribes. Caregivers' responses related to care management were identified and categorized into themes. RESULTS: Participants reported that they provided assistance with a wide range of diabetes care tasks (eg, skin and wound care, in-home dialysis) depending on the elder's level of impairment. Caregivers described three major challenges related to diabetes care management. (1) anxiety about in-home care, (2) coping with psychosocial issues, and (3) decision making and communication problems with other family members. They emphasized the importance of developing a care routine for successful diabetes management. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, we suggest areas where diabetes educators can assist American Indian family caregivers in meeting the needs of frail elders in the home.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - PURPOSE: Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common abnormality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Since the introduction of cinacalcet in 2004, a shift from surgery toward predominantly medical treatment has occurred. Surgery is thought to be associated with more complications than oral medication. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate 30-day outcomes and effectiveness of parathyroidectomy (PTx) in ESRD patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: A national database containing data from four academic medical centers in the Netherlands of patients with ESRD-related HPT, who had undergone PTx and kidney transplantation between 1994 and 2015, was established. Primary endpoints were 30-day mortality and complication rate. Secondary endpoints were biochemical measurements. RESULTS: We identified 187 HPT patients undergoing PTx, with a median age of 46 years. Median preoperative PTH level was 866 pg/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 407-1547 pg/mL). At 3 months, the median PTH drop from baseline was 93% (IQR, 71-98%) to a median of 61 pg/mL (IQR, 23-148 pg/mL, p < 0.001). Over the 25-year inclusion period, 13 patients (7.0%) required re-exploration for persistent or recurrent disease. Thirty-day mortality and complication rate were 0.0% and 7.9% respectively. Median serum calcium levels improved significantly postoperatively from 2.6 (2.4-2.8) mmol/L to 2.3 (2.1-2.5) mmol/L (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PTx is a safe and effective procedure in the frail ESRD population. These data show that there should be no reluctance for surgical intervention and when indicated, nephrologists can safely refer these patients for PTx.

N2  - Objective: Use of the frailty index to measure an accumulation of
deficits has been proven a valuable method for identifying elderly
people at risk for increased vulnerability, disease, injury, and
mortality. However, complementary molecular frailty biomarkers or
ideally biomarker panels have not yet been identified. We conducted a
systematic search to identify biomarker candidates for a frailty
biomarker panel.
Methods: Gene expression databases were searched
(http://genomics.senescence.info/genes including GenAge, AnAge,
LongevityMap, CellAge, DrugAge, Digital Aging Atlas) to identify genes
regulated in aging, longevity, and age-related diseases with a focus on
secreted factors or molecules detectable in body fluids as potential
frailty biomarkers. Factors broadly expressed, related to several
``hallmark of aging{''} pathways as well as used or predicted as
biomarkers in other disease settings, particularly age-related
pathologies, were identified. This set of biomarkers was further
expanded according to the expertise and experience of the authors. In
the next step, biomarkers were assigned to six ``hallmark of aging{''}
pathways, namely (1) inflammation, (2) mitochondria and apoptosis, (3)
calcium homeostasis, (4) fibrosis, (5) NMJ (neuromuscular junction) and
neurons, (6) cytoskeleton and hormones, or (7) other principles and an
extensive literature search was performed for each candidate to explore
their potential and priority as frailty biomarkers.
Results: A total of 44 markers were evaluated in the seven categories
listed above, and 19 were awarded a high priority score, 22 identified
as medium priority and three were low priority. In each category high
and medium priority markers were identified.
Conclusion: Biomarker panels for frailty would be of high value and
better than single markers. Based on our search we would propose a core
panel of frailty biomarkers consisting of (1) CXCL10 (C-X-C motif
chemokine ligand 10), IL-6 (interleukin 6), CX3CL1 (C-X3-C motif
chemokine ligand 1), (2) GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15), FNDC5
(fibronectin type III domain containing 5), vimentin (VIM), (3)
regucalcin (RGN/SMP30), calreticulin, (4) PLAU (plasminogen activator,
urokinase), AGT (angiotensinogen), (5) BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic
factor), progranulin (PGRN), (6) alpha-klotho (KL), FGF23 (fibroblast
growth factor 23), FGF21, leptin (LEP), (7) miRNA (micro Ribonucleic
acid) panel (to be further defined), AHCY (adenosylhomocysteinase) and
KRT18 (keratin 18). An expanded panel would also include (1) pentraxin
(PTX3), sVCAM/ICAM (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule
1/Intercellular adhesion molecule 1), defensin alpha, (2) APP (amyloid
beta precursor protein), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), (3) S100B (S100
calcium binding protein B), (4) TGF beta (transforming growth factor
beta), PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1), TGM2 (transglutaminase
2), (5) sRAGE (soluble receptor for advanced glycosylation end
products), HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1), C3/C1Q (complement factor
3/1Q), ST2 (Interleukin 1 receptor like 1), agrin (AGRN), (6) IGF-1
(insulin-like growth factor 1), resistin (REIN), adiponectin (ADIPOQ),
ghrelin (GHRL), growth hormone (GH), (7) microparticle panel (to be
further defined), GpnmB (glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B)
and lactoferrin (LTF). We believe that these predicted panels need to be
experimentally explored in animal models and frail cohorts in order to
ascertain their diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Long-term care will increasingly shift from institutions to home and community based services. Using data from a Medicaid home care waiver program in South Carolina, the Community Long-Term Care (CLTC) program, we evaluated differences in frailty and service use among CLTC clients between 1995 (n = 3,748) and 2005 (n = 9,157). The expectation was that CLTC clients had become more frail in that period, and had greater access to services in the community, results that might suggest the CLTC program had helped individuals to avoid institutionalization. Frailty measures included acute and chronic conditions, other health conditions, and activities of daily living (ADL). We evaluated the percentage of clients using services, and service use intensity. A large majority of clients in both years were impaired in at least four ADL. In 2005, CLTC clients were significantly more likely to have chronic conditions, including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, diabetes, and renal failure (all p < 0.05). Clients were significantly more likely to receive specific services in 2005, including physical therapy, dialysis, and oxygen (all p < 0.05). Results suggest CLTC participants were more frail in 2005 than in 1995. This may reflect a successful effort to help individuals age in place in the community, delaying institutionalization. States may be able to control increases in Medicaid long-term care costs through home care programs that delay institutionalization.

N2  - Persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLWH)
have accentuated risks for age-associated comorbidities. Compared with
the general population, PLWH have a twofold higher risk of
cardiovascular disease, a threefold increased risk of fracture, and a
risk of kidney disease that is comparable to that in diabetes. Some
comorbidities may present at younger ages than among the general
population, suggesting the possibility of accelerated aging with HIV
infection.

N2  - Background: The proportion of older people with end stage renal disease
is increasing. Their prognosis is characterized by a high mortality and
poor quality of life. Aim: To analyze the survival of patients starting
chronic hemodialysis (CHD) according to their age. Material and Methods:
Patients admitted to CHD in the East Metropolitan Health Service of
Santiago in a 2-year period were analyzed. Four age groups were created,
separating patients older than 70 years in a special group. Results:
During the study period, 459 patients were admitted to CHD and were
followed for an average of 27 months. The frequency of cardiovascular
comorbidity, cancer, and chronic renal disease of unknown cause
(attributed to nephrosclerosis) increased along with age. Mortality was
higher at older ages. There was a significant association between
starting CHD with a catheter, Charlson comorbidity index and increasing
age with mortality. For those aged over 80 years, mortality at three
months and one year was 25 and 43% respectively. Conclusions: Age,
Charlson index and vascular access are predictors of mortality in older
adults entering hemodialysis. This study suggests the importance of
considering comorbidities, assessment by specialists and creating an
arteriovenous fistula in this age group.

Frail recipients were 1.29 times (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.66; P = 0.04) more likely to experience MDR
N2  - BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose reduction or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead to rejection and possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known about what factors might cause or contribute to MDR. Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is emerging as an important, novel domain of risk in kidney transplantation recipients. We hypothesized that frailty, an inflammatory phenotype, might be associated with MDR. METHODS: We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor characteristics, longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 kidney transplantation recipients. Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: By 2 years after transplantation, 54% of frail recipients and 45% of nonfrail recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67% and 51%. Frail recipients were 1.29 times (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.66; P = 0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased donor recipients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.44-2.54, P < 0.001) and older adults (age >/= 65 vs <65; aHR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.96, P = 0.01). Mycophenolate mofetil dose reduction was independently associated with a substantially increased risk of death-censored graft loss (aHR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.97-13.98, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: A better understanding of risk factors for MMF intolerance might help in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression and prolong allograft survival.

N2  - Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequent in patients with
cardiovascular (CV) disease and impacts prognosis in these subjects.
While current guidelines recommend the CKD-EPI equation for the
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and recognizing CKD, a new
creatinine-based equation - the Berlin Initiative Study-1 (BIS-1) - was
generated for elders with a high prevalence of CV disease. We assessed
whether BIS-1 provided more accurate risk stratification than the
CKD-EPI equation in unselected aged patients with CV disease.
Methods Patients aged 70 years who were seen consecutively at the
Cardiovascular Centre of Trieste (Italy) between November 2009 and
October 2013 were recruited into this study. The correlation and
agreement between the BIS-1 and CKD-EPI formulas were evaluated and
intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were computed in order to
estimate the correlation between the two formulas. Patients were
followed for all-cause death, composite outcomes of all-cause
death/all-cause hospitalization and all-cause death/CV hospitalization.
Results A total of 7845 subjects met the inclusion criteria for this
study. GFR as estimated with the BIS-1 and the CKD-EPI equation was
highly correlated (ICC: 0.81; 95% confidence interval {[}CI]:
0.79-0.82; p<0.0001). When allocating patients in Kidney Disease
Improving Global Outcomes classes of eGFR, compared to CKD-EPI, the
BIS-1 formula reclassified 2720 (34.7%) patients: 53 (1.9%) were
placed in a better class and 2667 (98.1%) were placed in a worse class.
Multivariable Cox models showed that BIS-1 compared to CKD-EPI had a
significantly better accuracy for predicting death (NRI: 0.12; 95% CI:
0.03-0.19; p=0.001), death/CV hospitalization (net reclassification
improvement {[}NRI]: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.27-0.38; p<0.001) and
death/all-cause hospitalization (NRI: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.06-0.21;
p=0.001).
Conclusions The BIS-1 formula is better than the CKD-EPI formula for
risk stratification of CKD in elderly people with CV disease.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The clinical practice guidelines published by the Renal Physicians Association (USA) recommend instituting advance care planning (ACP) for patients with end-stage renal disease. Studies on this issue are lacking in Italy. Our aim was to determine the attitudes of patients on ACP in our dialysis centre. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey. We recruited patients on maintenance haemodialysis (HD) at Hemodialysis Center of Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, from 1 March 2014 to 31 March 2015. The only exclusion criterion was inability to give an informed consent. Patients completed a questionnaire concerning their treatment preferences in three hypothetical disease scenarios: persistent vegetative state, advanced dementia, severe terminal illness; for each patients, we also collected clinical, functional and socioeconomic data. RESULTS: Thirty-four HD outpatients completed the study questionnaire. The majority of respondents (85%) considered information about prognosis, health conditions and treatment options, including withdrawing dialysis, as very important and 94% of respondents considered treatment of uraemic/dialytic symptoms the most important issue. In the health scenarios provided, dialysis was the treatment least withheld. Dependence on instrumental activities of daily living (0.048) and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (p=0.035) were associated with continuing dialysis in at least one scenario. CONCLUSIONS: ACP should be tailored to patients' value, culture and preferences. A significant proportion of patients, however, do not want to be involved in end of life decisions. Frail elderly patients, in particular, are not inclined to interrupt dialysis, despite poor quality of life or a poor prognosis.

N2  - Type 2 diabetes prevalence is high in older adults and is expected to
rise in the next decades. Diabetes in the population of frail older
adults is accompanied by functional disability, several comorbidities,
and premature mortality. A comprehensive geriatric assessment, including
functional, cognitive, mental and social status, is advisable for
identifying the glycemic targets and glucose-lowering therapies, focused
on patient preferences, needs, and risks. The therapeutic options for
older adults with diabetes are like those for the adult population.
However, the pharmacological treatments must be carefully prescribed and
monitored, taking into consideration the patient cognitive capacities,
the potentially life-threatening drug-drug interactions, the
cardiovascular risk, and with the main goal of avoiding hypoglycemia.
Also, a careful nutritional evaluation with appropriate tools, as well
as a balanced and periodically monitored physical activity, contribute
to an effective tailored care plan, as needed by older adults with
diabetes. This review evaluates the currently available hypoglycemic
drugs and the current indications to the Italian diabetology community,
specifically with regard to the treatment of adults aged 75 years or
older with diabetes, including the unmet needs by the guidelines. (C)

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Elderly patients (> 65 years old) are a rapidly growing demographic in the ESRD and intensive care unit (ICU) populations, yet the effect of ESRD status on critical illness in elderly patients remains unknown. Reliable estimates of prognosis would help to inform care and management of this frail and vulnerable population. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The effect of ESRD status on survival and readmission rates was examined in a retrospective cohort of 14,650 elderly patients (>65 years old) admitted to 11 ICUs in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada between 2000 and 2006. Logistic regression models were used to adjust odds of mortality and readmission to ICU for baseline case mix and illness severity. RESULTS: Elderly ESRD patients had twofold higher crude in-hospital mortality (22% versus 13%, P < 0.0001) and readmission rate (6.4 versus 2.7%, P = 0.001). After adjustment for illness severity alone or illness severity and case mix, the odds ratio for mortality decreased to 0.85 (95% CI: 0.57 to 1.25) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.55 to 1.23), respectively. In contrast, ESRD status remained significantly associated with readmission to ICU after adjustment for other risk factors (OR 2.06 [95% CI: 1.32, 3.22]). CONCLUSIONS: Illness severity on admission, rather than ESRD status per se, appears to be the main driver of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients. However, ESRD status is an independent risk factor for early and late readmission, suggesting that this population might benefit from alternative strategies for ICU discharge.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To test whether frailty, a novel measure of physiologic reserve, is associated with longer kidney transplant (KT) length of stay (LOS), and modifies the association between LOS and mortality. BACKGROUND: Better understanding of LOS is necessary for informed consent and discharge planning. Mortality resulting from longer LOS has important regulatory implications for hospital and transplant programs. Which recipients are at risk of prolonged LOS and its effect on mortality are unclear. Frailty is a novel preoperative predictor of poor KT outcomes including delayed graft function, early hospital readmission, immunosuppression intolerance, and mortality. METHODS: We used registry-augmented hybrid methods, a novel approach to risk adjustment, to adjust for LOS risk factors from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (n = 74,859) and tested whether (1) frailty, measured immediately before KT in a novel cohort (n = 589), was associated with LOS (LOS: negative binomial regression; LOS >/=2 weeks: logistic regression) and (2) whether frailty modified the association between LOS and mortality (interaction term analysis). RESULTS: Frailty was independently associated with longer LOS [relative risk = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.29; P = 0.01] and LOS >/=2 weeks (odds ratio = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.06-2.33; P = 0.03) after accounting for registry-based risk factors, including delayed graft function. Frailty also attenuated the association between LOS and mortality (nonfrail hazard rate = 1.55 95% CI: 1.30-1.86; P < 0.001; frail hazard rate = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.19, P = 0.80; P for interaction = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Frail KT recipients are more likely to experience a longer LOS. Longer LOS among nonfrail recipients may be a marker of increased mortality risk. Frailty is a measure of physiologic reserve that may be an important clinical marker of longer surgical LOS.

N2  - Objectives To compare rates and risk factors for early hospital readmission for nursing home residents and community-dwelling older adults. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Geriatric inpatient service at a large urban hospital. Participants Nursing home residents (n = 625) and community-dwelling individuals (n = 413) aged 65 and older admitted over a 1-year period. Measurements Thirty-day readmissions. Results There were 1,706 hospital admissions within the 1-year study period involving 1,038 individuals. The 30-day readmission rate was higher for subjects discharged to a nursing home than those discharged to the community (34.4% vs 22.6%, P < .001). Chronic kidney disease and pressure ulcers were associated with greater risk of readmission in both groups. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was a risk factor for readmission only in community-dwelling individuals. Congestive heart failure and dementia were associated with greater risk of readmission only in nursing home residents. Readmission rates varied between individual nursing homes by more than a factor of 2. Risk of readmission was 30% lower in nursing home residents cared for by hospitalist than nonhospitalist geriatricians. Conclusion Higher rates of hospital readmission for individuals discharged to nursing homes than to the community and differing patterns of risk factors for readmission indicate the importance of customized interventions to reduce readmission rates for two distinct elderly populations.

N2  - The relationship between frailty and chronic kidney disease in elderly population has been recognized; however, studies concentrating on frailty in predialysis patients are limited. For nephrologists, the recognition of frailty is important as it has impact on decisions on the choice of dialysis modality and sometimes on whether dialysis is indeed in the patients' best interests. Many of the tools for routine assessment of frailty are not easily applicable to those clinicians not practicing elderly care medicine. A tool needs to be simple and applicable for daily routine practice. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and clinical outcome of frailty in an elderly predialysis population using simple tools. A nonrandomized prospective study was conducted in which, 104 patients aged 65 years or above with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25 mL or less were included. Data including age, sex, renal function, calcium, albumin, parathormone, and comorbidities were collected at baseline and at three months interval for one year. Functional performance was assessed using Karnofsky scale. The Charlson comorbidity index was used to assess comorbid status of each patient. Frailty was assessed using a combination of PRISMA questionnaire and Timed up and Go test. End points were death or start of dialysis at 20-month follow-up. A frail group (n = 58; males = 32, females = 26) and a nonfrail group (n = 46; males = 21, females = 25) were identified. Frailty was prevalent in 53.8% of the selected population. There was no significant difference between both groups in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, hemoglobin, inflammatory markers, or calcium hemostasis. Nine patients chose conservative management in the frail group and six in nonfrail group. Rate of death was significantly higher in the frail group (death = 14) compared to nonfrail group (death = 3; P = 0.01). There was no significant difference between both groups in terms of initiation of dialysis (P = 0.1). Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index were significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.023 and 0.032, respectively). Survival in frail patients who started peritoneal dialysis (PD) was slightly better than those started on hemodialysis (HD) with hazard ratio = 3.23 (P = 0.23). Our study shows that the prevalence of frailty and mortality rate is high among elderly predialysis patients. Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index are independent predictors of outcome in this population. PD might be a better option of dialysis modality compared to HD in the frail population.

N2  - Objective: In geriatric populations, frailty is associated with poor
health outcomes, including mortality. Frailty has not been examined in
lupus, although components of the phenotype seem relevant.
Methods: Women with lupus (n=152) participated in research visits in
2008-2009. Frailty was assessed by Fried's frailty phenotype criteria:
low weight/unintentional weight loss, slow gait (4-m walk using sex and
height criteria), weakness (grip strength using gender and body mass
index criteria), exhaustion (2 specific questions) and inactivity (from
physical activity questionnaire). Women accumulating 3+ components were
classified as `frail', one or two components as `prefrail', and none as
`robust'. Physical function (36 item Short Form (SF-36) Physical
Functioning subscale and Valued Life Activities disability scale),
cognitive function (from a 12-test battery) and mortality were examined
as outcomes. Mortality was determined as of December 2015. Multiple
regression analyses examined concurrent and 2-year function controlling
for age, lupus duration, race/ethnicity, glucocorticoid use, obesity,
self-reported disease activity and damage and, for longitudinal
analyses, baseline function. Mortality analyses controlled for age,
lupus duration and baseline disease damage scores.
Results: Mean age was 48 ( 12) years, mean lupus duration was 16 ( 9)
years. 20% of the sample was classified as frail and 50% as prefrail.
Frail women had significantly worse physical functioning than both
robust and prefrail women and were more likely to have cognitive
impairment. Frail women were also more likely to experience declines in
functioning and onset of cognitive impairment. Mortality rates were
significantly higher in the frail group (frail 19.4%; prefrail 3.9%;
robust 2.3%). Odds (95% CI) of death for frail women were elevated,
even after adjusting for age, lupus duration and baseline disease damage
(5.9 (0.6 to 57.1)).
Conclusions: Prevalence of frailty in this sample of women with lupus
was higher than in samples of older adults. Frailty was associated with
poor physical and cognitive function, functional declines and mortality.

N2  - BACKGROUND Context: Public home care services are delivered to at least 6% of Canadians age 65‐74, 15% age 75‐84 and 32% age 85 or older. These clients are medically complex, access care across settings, have very high emergency department utilization rates, and have relatively poor access to effective chronic disease management. Their frequent emergency department use is not aligned with chronic disease management or geriatric care principles. Effective chronic disease management models employ multiple components delivered by a coordinated multidisciplinary team. According to the 'chronic disease management model', home care plays a complementary function to medical practitioners. Clinical and self‐care support as well as case management are among the most effective components in chronic disease management. Self‐care education and support has been shown to improve health outcomes across chronic diseases. Sustained follow‐up by nurses or other non‐medical staff is also effective. Canadian home care providers, historically focused on the delivery of personal support services, have started to develop supportive chronic disease management capacity (e.g. specialist nurse monitoring). However, most trials exclude frail seniors and are not specific to home care, which leaves little evidence to inform chronic disease management practices. Previous Work: Effective chronic disease management in home care has been limited by insufficient targeting of clients at most need or most likely to benefit. The investigators developed and validated a prognostic case‐finding tool for home care known as the Detection of Indicators and Vulnerabilities of Emergency Room Trips (DIVERT) Scale that has been recommended for home care. It can be derived in real time from the Resident Assessment Instrument‐Home Care (RAI‐HC) standardized home care assessment used in 9 Canadian provinces as well as Estonia, Finland, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, and some U.S. states. Cardio‐respiratory symptoms and conditions are prominent predictive elements of the DIVERT Scale. Based on evidence‐based guidelines developed ‐ in part ‐ by the investigator team, the investigators piloted the combined use of the DIVERT Scale with a multi‐component cardio‐respiratory management model. The pilot pragmatic cluster randomized trial included over 200 clients across six home care caseloads. The pilot was recognized on the 2015 Ontario Minister's Medal Honour Role for Excellence in Health Quality. OBJECTIVES The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and preliminary cost‐effectiveness of a targeted, person‐centered cardio‐respiratory management model. Research questions: 1. Among home care clients experiencing cardio‐respiratory symptoms (objectively targeted using the DIVERT Scale), can a guideline‐based, feasible, multi‐component/complex, cardio‐respiratory management model, compared to regular care, reduce/postpone unplanned emergency department (ED) visits, improve patient activation, reduce cardio‐respiratory symptoms, reduce unplanned hospital use, or improve health‐related quality of life for clients, over a 6‐month follow‐up period from baseline? 2. If effective, is there evidence for cost‐effectiveness? METHODS Intervention: From evidence‐based guidelines developed ‐ in part ‐ by this team, extensive client profiling, and input of clients/families as well as health professionals, the investigators developed a person‐centred, multi‐component cardio‐respiratory management model containing the following components: scheduled nurse‐led self‐management support (based on a training program, and tool‐kit), advanced care and goal planning, clinical pharmacist medication reconciliation, team case rounds, SBAR (the Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation) communication protocol with primary care, and a standardized transition package. Each component has a specific objective within the model, however the manner in which it is delivered may be adapted. The approach is based on evidence of effective implementations in other fields, and includes all elements for 'person‐centred care'. Design: The investigators will conduct a pragmatic, cluster‐randomized trial that leverages secondary electronic patient records. Sixty (60) geographic areas (home care caseloads) will be randomized using a 1:2 (intervention: control) ratio. Population: Approximately 1,800 long‐stay home care clients living in a non‐institutional setting from 60 distinct geographic home care caseloads in Canada. Inclusion criteria: clients who are in the DIVERT Scale target groups (9,10, 14, 15) will be included (i.e. at least one cardio‐respiratory symptom (chest pain, dyspnea, dizziness, irregular pulse) and at least one cardiac condition (congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease)). The investigators will utilize the DIVERT Scale as an objective measure of eligibility. Clients who are receiving palliative care (i.e., prognosis of less than six months to live, K8e from Resident Assessment Instrument‐Home Care (RAI‐HC)) or dialysis (P2g from RAI‐HC) at baseline assessment will be excluded. Recruitment: Eligible clients will be identified by each case manager during regular home care enrollment and reassessment using the RAI‐HC assessment (standard practice) for between 6 to 8 months. Eligible clients will be automatically included into the intervention or 'regular care' control on an intent‐to‐treat basis. Each home care provider's process for attaining consent to intervention will apply. Study informed consent will not be sought given that the cardio‐respiratory management model is considered best practice care and is offered ‐ whole or in part ‐ at the full clinical discretion of the home care provider as per existing practice. The cardio‐respiratory management is accepted ‐ whole or in part ‐ at the full clinical discretion of the clients as per existing practice. Trial investigators have no part in the intervention pilot data collection, individual care decision‐making, or records management during the study period beyond providing guidance and access to resources. All trial data will be extracted from secondary data and anonymized prior to transmission by home care provider staff. Outcomes and Follow‐up: Primary Outcomes: ‐ Time to first unplanned emergency department visit within 6 months of baseline ‐ Presence of cardio‐respiratory symptoms over 6‐month follow‐up ‐ Cost of all home care services within 6 months of baseline Secondary Outcomes: ‐ Change in patient activation (based on 13 item patient activation measure) over 6‐month follow‐up ‐ Change in health‐related quality of life (based on Minimum Data Set Health Status Index) over 6‐month follow‐up ‐ Number of unplanned emergency department visits per days at risk (alive, not institutionalized) within 6 months of baseline ‐ Number of unplanned inpatient (medical) hospital days per days at risk (alive, not institutionalized) within 6 months of baseline A 6‐month follow‐up will be used to reflect the time at greatest risk among home care clients. Sample calculations/Assumptions: Primary outcome: Time to first unplanned emergency department visit within 6 months of baseline (alive, not institutionalized). Ability to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75. Mean size of a home care caseload: 120 clients Mean prevalence of DIVERT target group in each caseload: 30% Expected recruitment over 6 months per caseload: 30 Mean cluster size: 30 Allocation: 1:2 (intervention: control) Simulations using retrospective secondary data sources were undertaken to explore the power of a hypothetical DIVERT‐CARE trial conducted in the Hamilton‐Niagara‐Haldimand‐Brant (HNHB) health region of Ontario from December 2014 to June 2015. The simulations found that 60 HNHB home care caseloads randomized at a 1:2 intervention to control ratio could expect to enroll 1,809 patients across seven months. The simulation linked patients to their actual emergency department utilization records, and extended the time to first ED visit figures for patients in 20 randomly selected intervention caseloads to achieve a hazard ratio of 0.75, a figure chosen to be more conservative than the pilot study but still clinically significant. The overall event rate was 35.5% in the intervention group and 44.8% in the control. The median time to first visit was 88 days in the intervention group and 75 days in the control. The power of the simulated DIVERT trial was 94.12% with a two‐sided alpha of 0.05. Simulations with a hazard ratio of 0.80 yielded a power of 79.96% The intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) was estimated to be 0.005. Main Analyses: The primary hypothesis will be assessed through a multilevel discrete‐time proportional hazards model. The dependent variable will be days until first emergency department visit, censored at date of home care discharge for any reason. Caseload and partner site will be included as nested random effects. The hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval, and p‐value will be reported for the treatment group effect and covariates when applicable. A two‐sided alpha level of 0.05 will be used to judge statistical significance. The economic evaluation will examine total care costs, controlling for length of stay, between treatment groups to compare incremental costs to incremental effects (i.e. cost per ED visit averted). The secondary hypotheses will be evaluated by a multilevel general linear model. Six‐month change in health‐related quality of life, number of symptoms, patient activation, and number of emergency department visits will be the respective dependent variables. Caseload and home care provider site will be included as nested random effects. The unit change in each measure, 95% confidence interval, and p‐value will be reported for the treatment group effect and covariates when applicable. A two‐sided alpha level of 0.05 will be used to judge statistical

N2  - AIMS: To describe the characteristics and associated risk factors of patients with established diabetes who required Emergency Department (ED) care for severe hypoglycemia. METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective study to identify all cases of severe hypoglycemia among attendees at the EDs of three Italian University hospitals from January 2010 to December 2014. RESULTS: Overall, 520 patients with established diabetes were identified. Mean out-of-hospital blood glucose concentrations at the time of the hypoglycemic event were 2.2 +/- 1.3 mmol/L. Most of these patients were frail and had multiple comorbidities. They were treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs (43.6%), insulin (42.8%), or both (13.6%). Among the oral hypoglycemic drugs, glibenclamide (54.5%) and repaglinide (25.7%) were the two most frequently used drugs, followed by glimepiride (11.3%) and gliclazide (7.5%). Hospitalization rates and in-hospital deaths occurred in 35.4% and in 2.3% of patients, respectively. Cirrhosis (odds ratio [OR] 6.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-36.8, p < 0.05), chronic kidney disease (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.11-8.69, p < 0.05) and center (Sapienza University OR 3.70, 95% CI 1.57-8.69, p < 0.05) were the strongest predictors of increased rates of hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypoglycemia is a remarkable burden for patients with established diabetes and increases the risk of adverse clinical outcomes (in-hospital death and hospitalization), mainly in elderly and frail patients. This study further reinforces the notion that careful attention should be taken by health care providers when they prescribe drug therapy in elderly patients with serious comorbidities.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate for the first time the longitudinal relationship
between serumuric acid concentrations and risk of frailty.
Methods: Prospective cohort study of 2198 non-institutionalized
individuals aged >= 60 years recruited in 2008-2010. At baseline,
information was obtained on socio-demographic factors, health behaviors
and morbidity, while serum uric acid was determined in 12-h fasting
blood samples. Study participants were followed-up through 2012 to
assess incident frailty, defined as >= 2 of the following 4 Fried
criteria: exhaustion, muscle weakness, low physical activity, and slow
walking speed.
Results: During amean 3.5-year follow-up, 256 cases of incident frailty
were identified. After multivariate adjustment, the odds ratios (95%
confidence interval) of frailty comparing the second and third tertiles
of uric acid to the lowest tertile were, respectively: 1.18 (0.83-1.68)
and 1.57 (1.11-2.22); p-linear trend = 0.01. The corresponding result
for a 1mg/dL increase in serumuric acid concentration was 1.12
(1.00-1.24). Similar associations were observed across subgroups defined
by sex, age, body mass index, and physical activity. As regards each
frailty component, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) per 1
mg/dL increase in serumuric acid were 1.10 (0.99-1.23) for low physical
activity, 1.08 (0.95-1.23) for low walking speed, 1.08 (0.67-1.73) for
exhaustion and 0.91 (0.81-1.02) for weakness.
Conclusions: Serum uric acid concentrations are positively associated
with the risk of frailty in older adults. Further studies are needed to
evaluate whether specific dietary recommendations or pharmacological
strategies aimed at lowering serum uric acid would be beneficial to
prevent the development of this syndrome. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

N2  - Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults, affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased importance.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The population considered eligible for dialysis has expanded dramatically over the past 4 decades, so that a significant proportion of patients receiving renal replacement therapy are elderly, frail and infirm. These patients have an extremely limited life expectancy and suffer from significant symptom burden, similar to patients with other end-stage organ failure or cancer. As dialysis has been offered more broadly, it is now initiated earlier than in decades past, further adding to cost and patient burden. RECENT FINDINGS: The trend toward more expansive and intensive care has not been corroborated by robust data. In response, an increasing number of studies has focused on establishing reasonable limits to renal replacement therapy. Multiple authors have explored the role of conservative kidney management for high-risk dialysis patients as an alternative to dialysis, which may offer similar survival and improved quality of life in certain populations. For those who chose dialysis, deferring initiation until the patient becomes symptomatic may be a reasonable. Evidence-based symptom management guidelines for dialysis patients remain largely absent, with few proven approaches. Hospice and palliative care resources remain underutilized. SUMMARY: For a subset of dialysis patients, palliative care and conservative kidney management are appropriate and underutilized. VIDEO ABSTRACT: http://links.lww.com/COSPC/A8

N2  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) mainly targets the liver but can also induce extrahepatic manifestations. The kidney may be impacted via an immune mediated mechanism or a cytopathic effect. HCV patients are clearly at a greater risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) than uninfected patients are, and the presence of CKD increases mortality. Interferon-based therapies and ribavirin are difficult to manage and are poorly effective in end-stage renal disease and hemodialysis. These patients should be given priority treatment with new direct anti-viral agents (DAAs) while avoiding peginterferon and ribavirin. The first results were convincing. To aid in the correct use of these drugs in patients with renal insufficiency, their pharmacokinetic properties and potential renal toxicity must be known. The renal toxicity of these new drugs was not a safety signal in clinical trials, and the drugs are generally efficient in these frail populations. These drugs are usually well tolerated, but recent cohort studies have demonstrated that these new regimens may be associated with renal side effects, especially when using sofosbuvir combinations. HCV, renal diseases and comorbidities are intimately linked. The close monitoring of renal function is required, particularly for at-risk patients (transplanted, HIV-coinfected, CKD, hypertensive or diabetic patients). New DAA regimens, which will soon be approved, will probably change the landscape.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The CKD population is becoming increasingly elderly with multiple comorbidities. For this reason, accurate predictive information related to the progression into ESRD, mortality, and functional decline is critical to allow for optimal shared decision making (SDM). SUMMARY: This review will assess the current literature on the methodologies for the estimation of prognosis and prognostic tools developed for CKD. A practical clinical approach is discussed that involves the estimation of prognosis and integration of prognosis into SDM. KEY MESSAGE: There are validated, easy-to-use prognostic tools that help clinicians engage in effective shared decision making with their CKD patients and family.

N2  - Dialysis-associated steal syndrome with rest pain and ischemic nonhealing ulcers  dictates prompt surgical intervention. Distal revascularization with interval ligation is extensive surgery for frail patients in whom calcified distal arteries make anastomosis difficult. Simple banding is appropriate in high-flow fistulas. In low-flow accesses, further flow reduction by simple banding may result in inadequate dialysis and cause thrombosis. However, banding between puncture sites maintains a pressure gradient between the arterial and venous puncture sites that enables adequate flow with effective hemodialysis that would not be possible with banding at the anastomosis. This new technique is a good solution for maintaining access patency and increasing digital pressure while avoiding complicated surgical revisions in high-risk patients.

N2  - The features of ageing complicate the management of end-stage renal disease. These complicate all dialysis modalities and will greatly affect the ability to cope with interventional treatments and quality of life. The presence of other illnesses and comorbidity associated with kidney disease mean that many patients have a poor prognosis. It is therefore important to consider the impact of dialysis on lifestyle and whether survival will actually be improved for frail older patients. This review article considers how haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be adjusted for older patients, and, in particular, how the use of assistance makes peritoneal dialysis more feasible. Most importantly, older patients should be given realistic information about their prognosis and how they can cope with different treatment options, and then they should be involved in the decisions about their management.

N2  - ObjectivesTo investigate the relationship between frailty, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and loss of independence leading to the onset of disability or death among community-dwelling older Japanese.MethodsBetween 2002 and 2011, we conducted a 7-year prospective study involving 1,453 residents aged 65 years and over, initially free of disability, who underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment in Kusatsu town. Statistical analysis was conducted for those with complete values, resulting in a variable number of subjects for each data point. Frailty was defined for 1,335 subjects as three or more of the following criteria: weight loss (>2-3 kg in the past six months), weakness (grip strength was <26 kg for men and <18 kg for women), exhaustion (answer of "no" to the question "Do you feel full of energy?" on the Geriatric Depression Scale), slowness (usual gait speed<1.0 m/s), and low physical activity (answer of "less than once a week" to the question "How often do you usually go outdoors?"). MetS was defined for 1,450 subjects from the Japanese definition. The Cox proportional-hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) of loss of independence for 1,217 subjects.ResultsDuring the follow-up, 494 cases of loss of independence, including 376 disabilities and 118 deaths were identified. In men and women, the incidence of the loss of independence showed a significant linear trend according to the severity classification of frailty. By contrast, there was no relationship between MetS and the loss of independence. Subjects classified as prefrail and frail had an increased risk of loss of independence compared with robust participants, with sex- and age-adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of 1.5 (1.2-1.9) and 2.4 (1.8-3.3), respectively. After adjusting for sex, age, the presence of MetS, low serum total cholesterol, chronic kidney disease, anemia, low serum albumin, cognitive impairment, and past history of stroke, the respective multivariable HRs (95% CIs) of loss of independence were 1.5 (1.2-1.9) and 2.1 (1.5-2.9). The magnitude of the risk of loss of independence incidence for frailty was greater among the subjects aged 65-74 years than those aged >/=75 years.ConclusionsFrailty was significantly associated with incident loss of independence among elderly Japanese. The presence of MetS had no effect on subsequent onset of disability and mortality in elderly Japanese. Our findings suggest screening and intervention for frailty in the early stage of aging are beneficial to prolong healthy life expectancy of elderly Japanese.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Diabetic patients with end‐stage renal disease admitted to dialysis are increasing dramatically and are at a greater risk for cardiovascular events. The importance of physical activity has been widely adressed, specifically regarding chronic conditions. The American Heart Association and American College of Sports Medicine published a set of recommendations applying to older adults and chronic conditions. The aim of this study was to assess if an exercise program would be feasible in a group of elderly, frail and diabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis and if their exercise capacity could be improved. Methods: All 45 diabetic patients from our Unit were given the possibility to exercise, irrespective of degree of functional impairment. Nineteen patients were recruited (6 men, 13 women). 15 patients (5 men), mean age 72+/‐10 years, mean dialysis time 13 +/‐27 months, mean Charlson's Comorbidity Index of 4 (54 % patients), completed 16 weeks of supervised aerobic and resistance training, 3 times a week. Aerobic exercise training was performed with cycle‐ergometers or treadmills for 20 minutes, before dialysis sessions. Resistance training was performed during the second hour of dialysis, using elastic resistance bands for legs and dumbells for arms, for 20 minutes, with the vascular access arm being exercised before dialysis. Results: Patients' showed enhanced results for all tests of physical performance compared with baseline. The STS‐5 (Sit‐to‐stand‐to sit 5) was 14,5+/‐15,9 seconds at baseline (range: 10,7 ‐ 74) and 11,1+/‐4,9 seconds at 16weeks (range 7,7 ‐ 24,7); STS‐60 (Sit‐to‐sand‐to‐sit 60) was 22,0+/‐6,3 times at baseline (Min 4; Max 26,3) and 24,3+/‐6,5 at 16 weeks (range 12 ‐ 38); 6MWT was 265+/‐108,9meters at baseline (range: 115 ‐ 439) and 315+/‐133m at 16 weeks (range: 152 ‐ 615). All values were of statistical significance with p<0,01. The mean value at baseline for 6MWT was 265meters, which is below the cut‐off value for increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: None of the patients experienced any accident or complications due to the exercise program. Exercise training is safe and efficacious even for elderly, frail, disabled and diabetic patients on hemodialysis. All physical performance tests showed increased values when compared with baseline. The STS‐60, a surrogate measure of muscle endurance, increased by approximately 10%, The STS‐5, a surrogate measure of muscle power, increased by 24% and 6MWT, a surrogate measure of endurance and power, increased by 18%.

N2  - Nonexperimental studies of preventive interventions are often biased because of the healthy-user effect and, in frail populations, because of confounding by functional status. Bias is evident when estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness, even after adjustment for claims-based indicators of illness. We explored bias reduction methods while estimating vaccine effectiveness in a cohort of adult hemodialysis patients. Using the United States Renal Data System and linked data from a commercial dialysis provider, we estimated vaccine effectiveness using a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model of all-cause mortality before and during 3 influenza seasons in 2005/2006 through 2007/2008. To improve confounding control, we added frailty indicators to the model, measured time-varying confounders at different time intervals, and restricted the sample in multiple ways. Crude and baseline-adjusted marginal structural models remained strongly biased. Restricting to a healthier population removed some unmeasured confounding; however, this reduced the sample size, resulting in wide confidence intervals. We estimated an influenza vaccine effectiveness of 9% (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.15) when bias was minimized through cohort restriction. In this study, the healthy-user bias could not be controlled through statistical adjustment; however, sample restriction reduced much of the bias.

N2  - IMPORTANCE People who immigrate face unique health literacy,
communication, and system navigation challenges, and theymay have
diverse preferences that influence end-of-life care.
OBJECTIVE To examine end-of-life care provided to immigrants to Canada
in the last 6 months of their life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based cohort study
(April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2015) included 967 013 decedents in
Ontario, Canada, using validated linkages between health and immigration
databases to identify immigrant (since 1985) and long-standing resident
cohorts.
EXPOSURES All decedents who immigrated to Canada between 1985 and 2015
were classified as recent immigrants, with subgroup analyses assessing
the association of time since immigration, and region of birth, with
end-of-life care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Location of death and intensity of care
received in the last 6 months of life. Analysis included modified
Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for
age, sex, socioeconomic position, causes of death, urban and rural
residence, and preexisting comorbidities.
RESULTS Among 967 013 decedents of whom 47 514 (5%) immigrated since
1985, sex, socioeconomic status, urban (vs rural) residence, and causes
of death were similar, while long-standing residents were older than
immigrant decedents (median {[}interquartile range] age, 75 {[}58-84] vs
80 {[}68-87] years). Recent immigrant decedents were overall more likely
to die in intensive care (15.6% vs 10.0%; difference, 5.6%; 95% CI,
5.2%-5.9%) after adjusting for differences in age, sex, income,
geography, and cause of death (relative risk, 1.30;95% CI, 1.27-1.32).
In their last 6 months of life, recent immigrant decedents experienced
more intensive care admissions (24.9% vs 19.2%; difference, 5.7%;
95% CI, 5.3%-6.1%), hospital admissions (72.1% vs 68.2%;
difference, 3.9%; 95% CI, 3.5%-4.3%), mechanical ventilation (21.5%
vs 13.6%; difference, 7.9%; 95% CI, 7.5%-8.3%), dialysis (5.5% vs
3.4%; difference, 2.1%; 95% CI, 1.9%-2.3%), percutaneous feeding
tube placement (5.5% vs 3.0%; difference, 2.5%; 95% CI,
2.3%-2.8%), and tracheostomy (2.3% vs 1.1%; difference, 1.2%; 95%
CI, 1.1%-1.4%). Relative risk of dying in intensive care for recent
immigrants compared with long-standing residents varied according to
recent immigrant region of birth from 0.84 (95% CI, 0.74-0.95) among
those born in Northern and Western Europe to 1.96 (95% CI, 1.89-2.05)
among those born in South Asia.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among decedents in Ontario, Canada, recent
immigrants were significantly more likely to receive aggressive care and
to die in an intensive care unit compared with other residents. Further
research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this association.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between serum beta2-microglobulin (B2M) levels and frailty in an elderly Chinese population. DESIGN: A population-based cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data on 1,663 elderly participants (aged 70-84 years) from the aging arm of the Rugao Longevity and Ageing study, a population-based observational two-arm cohort study conducted in Rugao, China. MEASUREMENTS: The serum B2M was measured with chemiluminescence immunoassay by a technician in the biochemistry laboratory of the Rugao People's Hospital. Information on the frailty index and phenotype was collected. RESULTS: The mean B2M levels and frailty index were 1.8 mg/L and 0.16, respectively; 188 (11.3%) participants were classified as frail (frailty phenotype). For a standard deviation increase in B2M, the adjusted odds ratio for frailty phenotype was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.39; P=0.009) and the standardized coefficient for frailty index was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.11; P=0.004). Relative to the lowest quartile, the highest B2M quartile had a greater risk of prevalent frailty with adjusted odds ratios of 1.68 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.71; P=0.034) for frailty phenotype and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.27; P=0.044) for frailty index (>/=0.25). In addition, estimated glomerular filtration rate (based on B2M) or chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was significantly associated with frailty phenotype and index. CONCLUSION: B2M was significantly associated with both frailty phenotype and index in elderly Chinese population. The findings underscore the promising kidney relevant biomarkers for identifying vulnerable elderly Chinese population.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on prevalence of frailty among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD is associated with malnutrition, chronic inflammation, acidemia, impaired hormonal changes, and low physical activity, all of which can directly and indirectly contribute to the development of frailty. Coexistence of ESRD and frailty has been shown to increase risks of adverse health outcomes. Given potential reversibility of frailty, it is important to examine frailty status in this high-risk population. METHODS: Three databases (EMBASE, Medline, and CINAHL) were systematically searched for studies providing cross-sectional data of prevalence of frailty defined by cardiovascular health study (CHS) criteria among ESRD patients. Meta-analysis calculated pooled prevalence of frailty according to modifications of CHS criteria. RESULTS: Of 837 studies identified through the systematic review, seven studies were included. Three studies used both objectively measured and self-reported CHS criteria, and two studies each used only either criteria. Pooled prevalence of frailty was 36.8% (five studies: 95% CI = 29.9-44.1%, I (2) = 82.6%, p < 0.001) and 67.0% (five studies: 95% CI = 58.7-74.7%, I (2) = 96.5%, p < 0.001) according to the objectively measured and self-reported CHS criteria, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of ESRD patients were frail based on the objectively measured CHS criteria, and that prevalence of frailty almost doubled with the CHS criteria substituting self-reported physical function questionnaire score for objective measurements. Given substantial difference in prevalence of frailty depending on the modifications to CHS criteria, this information should be taken into account when evaluating frailty status among ESRD population.

N2  - The metaphor of a frail older person as a car running out of petrol
seems to have resonance in the lay media. Though it may be an over
simplistic representation of a complex and dynamic process, it does
facilitate discussion with patients and their relatives about the
appropriateness of interventions, such as whether or not there is enough
fuel (physiological reserves) to get up a really steep hill (undergo a
coronary bypass graft). It can also be used as a way to emphasise what
can be done to help. For example, in some longitudinal studies, 5% of
older patients are less frail after 5 years follow up, suggesting there
are things that can still be done to ``fill up the tank{''}. This review
will consider whether drug therapies can fulfil this role.
Frail older people are often prescribed long lists of medications but it
is debatable whether current treatments actually address the causes or
consequences of frailty itself. Here, we explore the associations
between frailty and co-morbidity and evaluate whether the management of
chronic disease may impact frailty development or progression. We
consider how the management of hypertension may have an important role
in the prevention of frailty, mediated by reduction of cerebrovascular
disease, but why aggressive management of hypertension may have negative
consequences for those who are already frail. We also summarise the
evidence linking immunosenescence, inflammation and endocrine changes to
frailty and investigate whether targeted drug therapy has the potential
to influence frailty pathophysiology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

N2  - Stroke prevention in elderly atrial fibrillation patients remains a challenge. There is a high risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism but also a high risk of bleeding if anticoagulants are prescribed. The elderly have increased chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, polypharmacy, and overall frailty. For all these reasons, anticoagulant use is underutilized in the elderly. In this manuscript, the benefits of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in the elderly patient population with multiple comorbid conditions are reviewed.

N2  - Ocular contusions are common and cause significant morbidity. The mechanism of ocular contusion is a decrease in the length of the anterioposterior axis whereas the transversal axis increases. Epidemiology data shows that young men are most injured in relation with sports, aggression, work, or car or work accidents. Injury to the ocular surface (conjunctiva and cornea) is minor. The iris is very frail, usually leading to hyphema which can progress to glaucoma. A cataract can appear after a contusion but usually years after the trauma. Final visual acuity can be compromised by retinal contusion or retinal detachment (due to a retinal dehiscence or post-traumatic dialysis). The worst outcome is optic neuropathy. The most difficult task is to predict visual acuity after the initial ocular lesion.

N2  - The present study was conducted to investigate depression in caregivers of elderly hemodialysis patients. Caregivers answered a self-administered questionnaire about various factors that may affect their depression, and also completed a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale evaluation (CESD). The frail elderly who received regular nurse visits were used as controls. Compared with the caregivers of controls, those of hemodialysis patients spent less time on caregiving and had more time to go out unaccompanied by their patients. Males were numerous among hemodialysis patients than in the controls. Compared with the controls, hemodialysis patients were less likely to be older old (80 years old and more), diagnosed as demented or severely limited in activities of daily living (ADL). On the other hand, we did not find any significant difference between the two groups with regard to either the prevalence of depression, the rate of those who experienced any life event such as to cause depression within 6 months (e.g., death of family member), duration of caregiving or time looking after patients. Caregivers of hemodialyis patients may feel a heavy burden because they are obliged to play an important role in supporting patients on dialysis. They seem to need more social support regardless of whether or not their patients suffer from dementia.

53rd ERA-EDTA Congress, Vienna, AUSTRIA, MAY 21-24, 2016
N2  - Introduction and Aims: Complications involving malnutrition or protein-energy status are common in CKD patients and greatly contributes to morbidity and mortality. Adequate assessment and management of malnutrition are unmet needs in this population. There is an urgent need for an evidenced-based approach to the identification and management of malnutrition in elderly/frail patients with advanced CKD (eGFR < 45ml/min/1.73m2) and in those on dialysis. Methods: The EBPG group carried out a systematic review to determine which nutritional interventions are effective in improving nutritional status in elderly patients (>65 years) with advanced CKD. 1,028 papers were retrieved; 94 (9.1%) selected for full text assessment, and 23 selected for quality assessment and data extraction. Among the remaining studies, only 5 were RCT’s, the majority being prospective observational, cross-sectional, or cohort studies. Results: There was no consensus on the definition of nutritional status or on the nutritional parameters which are relevant or need to be addressed in this population. This has resulted in different outcomes being reported as clinical end points in different studies. The majority of studies used biochemical (serum albumin) or clinical (SGA) outcome measures. The main interventions studied were nutritional supplements (oral or intravenous) or pharmacological. Oral nutritional supplements were commonly used, the nature of the supplement differing from study to study and included oral amino acids, mixtures of protein, carbohydrate and fat, and bicarbonate. The same variability was also noted for intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN). Significant improvements of nutritional parameters in response to these interventions were generally reported, mainly increased serum albumin, SGA, or nutritional index. The effects of pharmacological interventions, such as rhGH or nandrolone decanoate, are essentially anecdotal. Dietetic care may be useful throughout the course of CKD. However, there is no definitive evidence of effect of reported interventions on mortality rate. Conclusions: Oral supplements or IDPN may be useful to improve nutritional status in elderly/frail patients with advanced CKD or on dialysis. IDPN seems not to be superior to oral supplementation. There are insufficient data to suggest a pharmacological intervention in this field. Dietary counselling should be part of routine pre-ESRD care.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV)

.

Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors associated with AAV patients' mortality: frailty (HR = 2.43, P&lt; 0.001).
N2  - BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis in France. METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network. We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis. RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259 (61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and 19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95% CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16 months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition (13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown (18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001), peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P < 0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

12-15, 2010
N2  - Background: Inappropriate prescribing of primarily renally cleared
medications in older patients with kidney disease can lead to adverse
outcomes.
Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate
prescribing of 21 primarily renally cleared medications based on 2
separate estimates of renal function and to identify factors associated
with this form of suboptimal prescribing in older VA nursing home (NH)
patients.
Design: Longitudinal study
Participants: Participants were 1304 patients, aged 65 years or older,
admitted between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2005, for 90 days or more
to 1 of 133 VA NHs.
Main Measures: Potentially inappropriate prescribing of primarily
renally cleared medications determined by estimating creatinine
clearance using the Cockcroft Gault (CG) and Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD) equations and applying explicit guidelines for
contraindicated medications and dosing.
Key Results: The median estimated creatinine clearance via CG was 67
mL/min, whereas it was 80 mL/min/1.73m(2) with the MDRD. Overall,
11.89% patients via CG and only 5.98% via MDRD had evidence of
potentially inappropriate prescribing of at least 1 renally cleared
medication. The most commonly involved medications were ranitidine,
glyburide, gabapentin, and nitrofurantoin. Factors associated with
potentially inappropriate prescribing as per the CG were age older than
85 (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] 4.24, 95% confidence interval {[}CI]
2.42-7.43), obesity (AOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.50) and having multiple
comorbidities (AOR 1.09 for each unit increase in the Charlson
comorbidity index, 95% CI 1.01-1.19).
Conclusions: Potentially inappropriate prescribing of renally cleared
medications is common in older VA NH patients. Intervention studies to
improve the prescribing of primarily renally cleared medications in
nursing homes are needed. (J Am Med Dir Assoc 2011; 12: 377-383)

N2  - Despite substantial improvements following the introduction of novel agents and antibodies, amyloid light-chain (AL)-amyloidosis still carries a grim prognosis. Here, we report on the case of a severely frail 86-year-old patient suffering from monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS)-associated AL-amyloidosis with a diuretic-refractory nephrotic syndrome. In this patient, treatment with bortezomib-dexamethasone effectively induced a serological response, but was unfortunately poorly tolerated and failed to promote renal recovery fast enough to prevent secondary complications. Facing ongoing nephrotic syndrome, we performed unilateral kidney embolization and observed a substantial improvement of hypoalbuminemia accompanied by a significant gain in overall quality of life despite the necessity for thrice weekly dialysis. It can be concluded that systemic drugs in MGRS typically do not lead to instantaneous organ recovery but may initially rather be associated with substantial treatment-related morbidity. In this setting, unilateral renal artery embolization is effective to treat nephrotic syndrome and its secondary complications. The risk of potentially adverse effects, including post-embolization syndrome, can be minimized by unilateral embolization, still noting that also one-sided renal ablation has to be balanced against the requirement for life-long renal replacement therapy. Prospective controlled trials in a more comprehensive cohort will be needed to estimate the overall benefit of kidney embolization relative to novel agent therapies in frail patients with MGRS-related AL-amyloidosis.; © 2018 International Society for Hemodialysis.

N2  - Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is rare and characterized endoscopically by distal esophageal ulceration, blackening, and necrosis. It typically arises in patients with multiple comorbidities who have significant systemic disease and frailty. Specific precipitating events are variable. Evidence suggests a multifactorial etiology likely involving esophageal ischemia in the setting of corrosive injury from gastric contents and impaired tissue repair mechanisms. In the transplant setting, immunosuppression likely plays a substantial role. We report a case of AEN in a 70-year-old man following a renal transplant.

N2  - AIM: To present the rationale, design and methodology of the GERAS project, which examines whether assessment of frailty and mild cognitive impairment could enhance risk prediction for biomedical, psychosocial outcomes and foster efficient resource allocation in kidney transplantation. BACKGROUND: For the burgeoning cohort of older patients considered for kidney transplantation, evidence gaps regarding frailty and mild cognitive impairment limit clinical decision-making and medical management. As known risk factors for 'hard' clinical outcomes in chronic illness, both require further study in transplantation. Integrating these and other bio-psychosocial factors into a comprehensive pre-transplant patient assessment will provide insights regarding economic implications and may improve risk prediction. DESIGN: A nation-wide multi-centre prospective cohort study nested in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study. METHODS: Our nationally representative convenience sample includes 250 adult kidney transplant recipients. Data sources include the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study and primary data collected at time of transplantation, 6 months, 1 and 2 years post-transplant via established measures (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Psychosocial Questionnaire, Fried Frailty Instrument and a blood analysis), investigator-developed instruments and datasets compiled by hospitals' management control units, sickness funds, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and the European Renal Association. Descriptive, competing risk survival and mixed effects analyses will be performed. Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained in January 2016. DISCUSSION: This pioneering project jointly examines frailty and mild cognitive impairment from bio-psychosocial and health economic perspectives. Results may significantly inform risk prediction, care tailoring and resource optimization to improve health outcomes in the ageing kidney transplant cohort.

N2  - Age is well recognized as a powerful prognostic factor in the setting of cardiovascular disease. With the aging of the US population, it is projected that more than 50 million people will be aged over 65 years by the year 2020. This growing elderly population has increased rates of morbidity and mortality owing to cardiovascular disease; however, proven therapies for prevention and treatment are often underused in older patients, largely because physicians perceive them as being frail and have limited understanding of age-related unique adverse and therapeutic effects. Advancing age is associated with a number of physiologic and pathophysiologic changes that impact the toxic effects, efficacy and dosing of many medications. Decreases in lean muscle mass affect the volume of distribution, and reductions in hepatic function affect the metabolism of many medications. Age-related reductions in renal function might have the most profound impact on the safety profile and dosing of medications in elderly patients. The strong association between renal and cardiovascular disease makes recognition of renal dysfunction and appropriate dose adjustment particularly important in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. This article reviews current approaches to the estimation of renal function, and unique considerations related to prescribing medication for elderly patients with concomitant renal and cardiovascular disease.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - IMPORTANCE: Patients on dialysis are often elderly and frail, with multiple comorbid conditions, and are heavy users of Emergency Department (ED) services. However, objective data on the frequency and pattern of ED utilization by dialysis patients are sparse. Such data could identify periods of highest risk for ED visits and inform health systems interventions to mitigate these risks and improve outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe the pattern and frequency of presentation to ER by dialysis patients. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using administrative data collected over ten years (2000-2009) in the Province of Manitoba, Canada. SETTING: Patients presenting to any of 9 ED's in Winnipeg and Brandon Manitoba. These departments serve >90% of the population of Manitoba, Canada (population 1.2 million). PARTICIPANTS: All patients presenting to an ED in any of 9 emergency departments in Manitoba, Canada. EXPOSURE: Dialysis status. MAIN OUTCOMES: Presentation to the ED. RESULTS: Over 2.1 million ED visits by more than 1.2 million non-dialysis patients and 17,782 ED visits by 3257 dialysis patients were included. Dialysis patients presented 8.5 times more frequently to the ED than the general population (age and sex adjusted, p<0.001). For dialysis patients, ED utilization was significantly higher following the long interdialytic interval (33.6% higher Mondays and 19.5% higher Tuesdays vs. other days of the week, p<0.001) and was 10-fold higher in the 7 days before and after the initiation of dialysis. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The heavy use of ED services by dialysis patients spikes upward following the long interdialytic interval and also in the week before and after dialysis initiation. The relative risks associated with these vulnerable periods were much higher than those reported for clinical patient characteristics. We propose that intrinsic gaps in the structure of care delivery (e.g. 3 times a week dialysis, imperfect surveillance and clinical monitoring of patients with low GFR) may be the fundamental drivers of this periodicity. Strategies to mitigate this excess health risk are needed.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors such as canagliflozin and  dapagliflozin have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A PubMed search was conducted of the literature from April 1996 to August 2014 to identify all human studies related to SGLT2 inhibitors. Pertinent guidelines of experts and the prescribing information for canagliflozin and dapagliflozin are reviewed. SGLT2 inhibitors may be used as an add-on therapy in select and relatively healthy older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are overweight and have uncontrolled hypertension. These medications should be avoided in patients who are frail, who have chronic kidney disease, and in conjunction with insulin or sulfonylureas.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are life-threatening complications after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only half of CD20-positive PTLDs respond to rituximab monotherapy, and outcomes remain poor for patients with relapsed/refractory disease, especially those who do not qualify for an anthracycline containing regimen due to frailty or comorbidities. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) might be an option in this particular setting. We report a panel of eight patients with rituximab refractory/relapsed CD20-positive PTLDs including three ineligible for subsequent CHOP-like chemotherapy who received (90) Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan as a single agent (n = 7) or combined to chemotherapy (n = 1). Five out of eight patients were kidney transplant recipients, while 2/8 had a liver transplant and 1/8 had a heart transplant. Patients received a median of two previous therapies. Overall response rate was 62.5%. Importantly, all responders achieved complete response. At a median follow-up of 37 months [5; 84], complete response was ongoing in four patients. Toxicity was predominantly hematological and easily manageable. No graft rejection was noticed concomitantly or following RIT administration despite immunosuppression reduction after diagnosis of PTLDs. This report emphasizes the potential efficiency of salvage RIT for early rituximab refractory PTLDs without any unexpected toxicity.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is less defined. METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR </=30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767 (30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 (12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction, oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male sex. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of falling is complex, and identification of risk factors may be essential for prevention. The relationship between renal disease and falls is unclear, and the goal of this study was to collect the available evidence and investigate the relationship between accidental falls and renal dysfunction. METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid SP and Web of Science databases to identify the appropriate literature. The themes used were: falls (combined in the title/abstract fall or falls or falling or faller* or fallen or slip* or trip* or (MeSH) accidental falls) and renal insufficiency (chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases combined in title/abstract renal disease* or kidney disease* or renal insufficiency or kidney insufficiency or kidney failure or renal failure or MeSH renal insufficiency, chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases). The incidence, risk factors, complications, and characteristics of the falls were analyzed. RESULTS: Eight prospective cohorts including five cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study were identified. No randomized controlled studies were found. The incidence of falls in chronic kidney disease patients ranged between 1.18 and 1.60 fall/patient year. These were frequent in frail older adults on hemodialysis treatment. Falling relapses in the same group of patients caused serious consequences. Data on pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) were scarce. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of falling appears to be common in patients with renal dysfunction especially in older adults undergoing hemodialysis. On the other hand, we could not find any conclusive data on pre-ESRD patients.

N2  - Background: Many people on dialysis suffer a variety of conditions that can affect frailty (the condition or quality of being frail), such as comorbidities, disabilities, dependence, malnutrition, cognitive impairment and poor social conditions. Frailty is suspected to affect quality of life (QoL). Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of the different components of frailty on the QoL of people on dialysis. Methods: We enrolled 203 out of 233 prevalent patients on dialysis in the Trieste area of Italy. We applied the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire, Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Subjective Global Assessment scales and Karnofsky Index. In addition we analysed their social conditions. Results: Dependence, malnutrition and disability had a negative role on QoL. Living with family and good social-economic conditions were significantly related to a better QoL. Conclusions: Dependence, malnutrition, disability, poor social and economic conditions have a significant effect on life quality. The role of comorbidities appears to be less important. Screening of patients, nutritional and functional rehabilitation and prevention of social isolation appear to be indispensable in guaranteeing a satisfactory life quality. © 2013 European Dialysis and Transplant Nurses Association/European Renal Care Association.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The decision-making process of dialysis initiation in the elderly involves different considerations compared with younger patients. Cognitive, functional and psychosocial issues are likely to be more important than standard prognostic factors. To assess the role of these issues in the decision-making process regarding dialysis initiation in the elderly, a survey was conducted among nephrologists in the Netherlands. METHODS: An internet-based survey was sent to all members of the Netherlands Federation of Nephrology. RESULTS: Out of 298 invited, 94 Dutch nephrologists responded to the questionnaire. Reaching consensus with the patient and relatives and early withdrawal are difficult issues in the decision-making process in elderly end-stage renal disease patients. Geriatric impairments were considered (very) relevant issues (varying from 7- 0 on a scale from 1-10) in the context of dialysis initiation, with cognitive dysfunction being most relevant (median 10, range 6-10). The majority of nephrologists (56%) underlined the need for screening for geriatric problems when considering dialysis in the elderly. A total of 26% reported using some form of screening measurement for the determination of the presence of one or more geriatric impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Although cognitive, functional and psychosocial issues are considered relevant items in the context of dialysis initiation in the elderly, systematic assessment of these items is not standard of care in nephrology practice. Future research is needed to determine whether a more systematic screening for the presence of geriatric impairments can improve the decision-making process.

.

frailty (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36)
N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in France. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and causes of death were analyzed. RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334 (23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72 years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis, 67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although individuals classified as nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, are entitled to receive emergency dialysis in the United States regardless of their ability to pay, most states do not provide them with subsidized care for maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation. We explored whether nonresident aliens have similar outcomes to US citizens after receiving kidney transplants covered by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adult Medicaid patients in the US Renal Data System who received their first kidney transplant from 1990 to 2011. PREDICTOR: Citizenship status, categorized as US citizen, nonresident alien, or permanent resident. OUTCOME: All-cause transplant loss. MEASUREMENTS: HRs and 95% CIs estimated by applying Cox proportional hazards frailty models with transplantation center as a random effect. RESULTS: Of 10,495 patients, 8,660 (82%) were US citizens, 1,489 (14%) were permanent residents, and 346 (3%) were nonresident aliens, whom we assumed were undocumented immigrants. Nonresident aliens were younger, healthier, receiving dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a living donor. 71% underwent transplantation in California, and 61% underwent transplantation after 2005. Nonresident aliens had a lower unadjusted risk for transplant loss compared with US citizens (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still significant when adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, dialysis, and transplant-related factors (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94). LIMITATIONS: Citizenship status was self-reported, possible residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the select group of insured nonresident aliens who undergo transplantation with Medicaid do just as well as US citizens with Medicaid. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for kidney transplantation in nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, given the associated high-quality outcomes in these patients.

N2  - There is an ongoing increase in the number of elderly or frail patients requiring renal replacement therapy. Assisted automated peritoneal dialysis (aAPD) is one treatment option for this patient group and is becoming increasingly recognized as a distinct dialysis modality. In this article, we review the current status of aAPD and its evolution across Europe, describing the differences in service provision. We also report our experience locally of outcomes on our aAPD population over the last 4 years. We found that aAPD is a viable dialysis modality in the frail and elderly with limited lifespan, and complications of peritoneal dialysis are perhaps lower than would be expected in this population. This form of therapy also avoids the disruption to life which results from hospital-based dialysis.

N2  - Dedicated European and US clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes in the elderly  have been released, but they do not specifically address the issue of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) in older patients with diabetes. General clinical guidelines have been published on the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN), but these address the issue of how to prevent progression and treat advanced DN without distinguishing between different age groups. Elderly patients with diabetes and stages 3 to 4 CKD have particular needs that differ from those of younger patients with the same conditions. This is mainly due to their frailty and shorter life expectancy. Differently tailored therapeutic strategies are needed, which may have less stringent targets; and the use of common drugs should be critically evaluated. The management agenda (metabolic control, low-protein diet, controlling BP, preventing progression of advanced DN, preventing cardiovascular outcomes) for these patients is discussed in light of the limits and perspectives of current guidelines. Intensive, simultaneous management of all items on the agenda may not be feasible for a proportion of older patients, and clinicians may have to give priority to reducing some risk factors rather than others, choosing between different therapies.

N2  - Background Nurse-assisted automated peritoneal dialysis (AAPD) offers a model of care that has been successfully used in frail dialysis populations internationally. AAPD offers cost savings over hospitalisation on peritoneal dialysis (PD) or in-centre haemodialysis (HD). Method A pilot AAPD model of care was developed in Western Australia (WA). Patient evaluation was measured utilising a perceptions of dialysis survey, clinical events, hospitalisation and peritonitis rates, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), KDQoL-SF 36 and a survey. Staff opinions and perceived competency were measured by an online survey. Economic analysis was undertaken. Results A successful collaborative model was developed. 40 staff were trained and competency significantly improved during program delivery (p<0.0001). 15 patients with an average CCI score of 8.7 used the service for 18 periods of care over 18 months (mean 33 days SD 47). Two non-renal cause deaths and two episodes of peritonitis occurred. Patient opinions were extremely positive. Cost savings were estimated at $620,000. Conclusion In WA, an AAPD pilot program has been successfully developed and delivered. A sustainable model has overcome initial hurdles. Staff have gained new skills and delivered effective care, demonstrated by high patient acceptance. The program was cost-effective compared to staying in hospital or transferring to HD.

N2  - Many patients become frail with diminished cardiorespiratory fitness while awaiting kidney transplantation. Frailty and poor fitness powerfully predict mortality, transplant graft survival, and healthcare utilization after kidney transplantation. Efforts to intervene with post-transplant physical therapy have been met with limited success, in large part due to high study dropout. We reviewed the literature on chronic kidney disease and exercise to propose a clinical framework for physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, scheduled for before the transplant. This framework may lead to better patient retention and compliance, and thus demonstrate better efficacy in mitigating the effects of frailty and poor fitness after kidney transplantation.

N2  - PURPOSE: A previous clinical trial showed that radiologic insertion of first peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters by modified Seldinger technique is noninferior to laparoscopic surgery in patients at low risk in a clinical trial setting. The present cohort study was performed to confirm clinical effectiveness of radiologic insertion in everyday practice, including insertion in patients with expanded eligibility criteria and by fellows in training. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2004 and 2009, 286 PD catheters were inserted in 249 patients, 133 with fluoroscopic guidance in the radiology department and 153 by laparoscopic surgery. Survival analyses were performed with the primary outcome of complication-free catheter survival and secondary outcomes of overall catheter survival and patient survival. Outcomes were assessed at last follow-up, as long as 365 days after PD catheter insertion. RESULTS: In the radiologic group, unadjusted 365-day complication-free catheter, overall catheter, and patient survival rates were 22.6%, 81.2%, and 82.7%, respectively, compared with 22.9% (P = .52), 76.5% (P = .4), and 92.8% (P = .01), respectively, in the laparoscopic group. Frequencies of individual complications were similar between groups. Adjusting for patient age, comorbidity, and previous PD catheter, the hazard ratio (HR) for catheter complications by radiologic versus laparoscopic insertion is 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.31); the HR for overall catheter survival is 1.25 (95% CI, 0.59-2.65); and that for death is 2.47 (95% CI, 0.84-7.3). CONCLUSIONS: Radiologic PD catheter insertion is a clinically effective alternative to laparoscopic surgery, although there was poorer long-term survival with radiologic catheter placement, possibly because of preferential selection of radiologic insertion for more frail patients.

N2  - Receipt of pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) clinical care can improve outcomes  for patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis (HD). This study addressed age-related variations in receipt of a composite of recommended care to include nephrologist and dietician care, and use of an arteriovenous fistula at first outpatient maintenance HD. Less than 2% of patients treated with maintenance HD received all three forms of pre-ESRD care, and 63.3% received none of the three elements of care. The mean number of pre-ESRD care elements received by the oldest group (80 years and older) did not differ from the youngest group (less than 55 years), but was less than the 55 to 66 and 67 to 79 years groups; adjusted ratios of 0.93 (0.92 to 0.94; p < 0.001) and 0.94 (0.92 to 0.95; p < 0.001), respectively. A major effort is needed to ensure comprehensive pre-ESRD care for all patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially for the youngest and oldest patient groups, who were less likely to receive recommended pre-ESRD care.

N2  - PURPOSE: Although a population's senescence rate is classically measured as the increase in mortality rate with age on a logarithmic scale, it may be more accurately measured as the increase on a linear scale. Patients on dialysis, who suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality rate on a logarithmic scale, but a larger increase on a linear scale than patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be biased by population heterogeneity. METHODS: Follow-up data on 323,308 patients on dialysis and 91,679 patients with a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models that allow individual variation in this increase. RESULTS: According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase in mortality rate on a logarithmic scale was smaller in patients on dialysis, while the senescence rate measured as the increase on a linear scale was larger in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant. CONCLUSIONS: Also when accounting for population heterogeneity, a population's senescence rate is more accurately measured as the increase in mortality rate on a linear scale than a logarithmic scale.

N2  - The number of elderly patients requiring renal replacement therapy will continue  to increase in the future. Previously, these patients were believed to have a poor prognosis on renal replacement therapy and therefore they were treated with conservative measures. Although there are no controlled randomized studies, an increasing amount of literature indicates that elderly persons with end-stage kidney disease are a heterogeneous population and that, in many of them, dialysis provides a good quality of life and survival. Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have their own advantages and disadvantages and therefore it is important to individualize treatment to achieve the best result for each patient, taking into account the patient's wishes, local circumstances, availability of dialysis centers, and proper social support. Home treatments are the most suitable for frail elderly patients. In the latter population, peritoneal dialysis may be the method of choice because it can be performed by visiting nurses, thus allowing the patient to receive treatment at home without increasing the overall cost.

N2  - This study examined whether chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with recurrent falls in older adults in nursing homes (NHs). We used data abstracted over a six month period from 510 NH residents with a history of falls. Thirty-five percent of the NH residents had CKD. In adjusted analyses, the incidence of recurrent falls was similar in those with and without CKD [fall rate ratio (FRR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.02]. Orthostatic hypotension (FRR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12-2.05), history of falls during the prior six month period (FRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.49), cane or walker use (FRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.16-2.33), and ambulatory dysfunction (FRR 1.47, 95% CI 1.23-1.75) were independently associated with increased fall rate. CKD was not an important predictor of falls in this cohort of nursing home residents with prior falls. Instead, traditional fall risk factors were much more strongly associated with recurrent falls.

N2  - Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle mass loss and function in the future.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered a model of accelerated aging. More specifically, CKD leads to reduced physical functioning and increased frailty, increased vascular dysfunction, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness, high levels of systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence suggests that the cognitive impairment associated with CKD may be related to cerebral small vessel disease and overall impairment in white matter integrity. The triad of poor physical function, vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment places patients living with CKD at an increased risk for loss of independence, poor health-related quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the available evidence of cerebrovascular-renal axis and its interconnection with early and accelerated cognitive impairment in patients with CKD and the plausible role of exercise as a therapeutic modality. Understanding the cerebrovascular-renal axis pathophysiological link and its interconnection with physical function is important for clinicians in order to minimize the risk of loss of independence and improve quality of life in patients with CKD.

N2  - The purpose of this cross-sectional prospective study was to determine
the prevalence of anemia among elderly hospitalized patients in Germany
and to investigate its association with multidimensional loss of
function (MLF). One hundred participants aged 70 years or older from two
distinct wards (50 each from an emergency department and a medical ward,
respectively) underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA)
consisting of the following six tools: Barthel Index, mini-mental state
examination, clock-drawing test, timed up and go test, Esslinger
transfer scale, and Daniels test. MLF as an aggregated outcome was
diagnosed when three or more tests of the CGA showed an abnormal result.
Anemia was defined according to WHO criteria as a hemoglobin (Hb)
concentration of < 13 g/dL for men and < 12 g/dL for women. The
prevalence of anemia was 60 %. Overall, 61 % of patients presented
with three or more abnormal results in the six tests of the CGA and,
thus, with MLF. Using logistic regression, we found a significant
association of both anemia and low Hb concentrations with abnormal
outcomes in five tests of the CGA and, therefore, with domain-specific
deficits like mobility limitations, impaired cognition, and dysphagia.
Furthermore, being anemic increased the odds of featuring MLF more than
fourfold. This significant relationship persisted after adjustment for
various major comorbidities. Both anemia and geriatric conditions are
common in the hospitalized elderly. Given the association of anemia with
MLF, Hb level might serve as a useful geriatric screening marker to
identify frail older people at risk for adverse outcomes.

N2  - Frailty is a critical factor influencing the health and outcomes of
older surgical patients. Current surgical care for these patients is
plagued by high morbidity and mortality rates. There is a growing
interest in improving the quality of surgical care for older adults
which has resulted in several recent advancements. Unique quality
indicators for the older surgical population, multidisciplinary
consensus on best practices, and an emerging focus on process and
outcome measures that matter to older patients are recent contributions
to a movement that will redefine the quality of surgical care for frail
older adults.

As such, an understanding of the overlap among complications of hemodialysis and geriatric syndromes is crucial. This article reviews hemodialysis management issues including vascular access, hypertension, anemia and bone and mineral disorders with an attention towards the distinct medical needs of the elderly. Key concepts of geriatrics frailty, dementia and palliative care are also discussed, as nephrologists frequently participate in decision-making directed toward balancing longevity, functional status and the burden of therapy.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although therapeutic failure may be a common cause of drug-related morbidity in older adults, few studies have focused on this problem. The study objective was to determine the frequency and types of, and the factors associated with, therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients, using a new instrument named the Therapeutic Failure Questionnaire (TFQ). METHODS: The sample included 106 frail, hospitalised elderly patients enrolled in a 1-year-long health service intervention trial at 11 Veterans Affairs Medical Centres. The TFQ was developed by a team of clinical geriatricians and tested for reliability by two clinical pharmacists and a geriatrician on a sample of 32 patients. To establish validity, a geriatrician retrospectively reviewed the computerised medication records and clinical charts for these patients and applied the TFQ to determine probable therapeutic failures at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: Inter- and intra-rater reliability for the TFQ were very good (kappa = 0.82 for both). Overall, 11% of patients had one or more probable therapeutic failures (TFQ scores between 4 and 7) leading to hospitalisation. Cardiopulmonary disease was a common 'indicator' of therapeutic failure and was often the result of non-adherence. The only factor associated with therapeutic failure occurrence was severe chronic kidney disease (crude odds ratio 5.87; 95% CI 1.20, 28.69; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The TFQ was able to identify several cases of probable therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients. Non-adherence to effective therapies for chronic serious cardiopulmonary disease was a common cause of therapeutic failure and represents a target for interventions to reduce hospitalisation. Further research on the occurrence, risk factors for and types of therapeutic failure is needed in a larger cohort of older non-veterans.

post-KT mortality

.

At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5%, 86.0% and 77.5% for nonfrail, intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.01-4.65, p = 0.047) higher risk of death.
N2  - We have previously described strong associations between frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, and early hospital readmission as well as delayed graft function. The goal of this study was to estimate its association with postkidney transplantation (post-KT) mortality. Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to substantially improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients (n = 37 858) and introduced these into the single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5%, 86.0% and 77.5% for nonfrail, intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.01-4.65, p = 0.047) higher risk of death. In conclusion, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent risk factor for post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many confounders using a novel, efficient statistical approach.

poor dialysis outcomes, renal treatment satisfaction questionnaire.
N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In-center hemodialysis (HD) is often the default dialysis modality for older patients. Few centers use assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD), which enables treatment at home. This observational study compared quality of life (QoL) and physical function between older patients on assisted PD and HD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Patients on assisted PD who were >60 years old and on dialysis for >3 months were recruited and matched to patients on HD (needing hospital transport) by age, sex, diabetes, dialysis vintage, ethnicity, and index of deprivation. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale. QoL assessments included Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Short Form-12, Palliative Outcomes Symptom Scale (renal), Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale, and Renal Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (RTSQ). Physical function was evaluated by Barthel Score and timed up and go test. RESULTS: In total, 251 patients (129 PD and 122 HD) were recruited. In unadjusted analysis, patients on assisted PD had a higher prevalence of possible depression (HADS>8; PD=38.8%; HD=23.8%; P=0.05) and higher HADS depression score (median: PD=6; HD=5; P=0.05) but higher RTSQ scores (median: PD=55; HD=51; P<0.01). In a generalized linear regression model adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, dialysis vintage, and frailty, assisted PD continued to be associated with higher RTSQ scores (P=0.04) but not with other QoL measures. CONCLUSIONS: There are no differences in measures of QoL and physical function between older patients on assisted PD and comparable patients on HD, except for treatment satisfaction, which is higher in patients on PD. Assisted PD should be considered as an alternative to HD for older patients, allowing them to make their preferred choices.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Survival for patients commencing renal replacement therapy is around  90% in the first year and 83% at two years after starting dialysis. The factors that appear to predict mortality are comorbidity and frailty associated with kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate, age and biochemical factors. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the condition of patients starting renal replacement therapy, based on biomarkers commonly used in clinical practice and their association with mortality, measured 6 and 12 months after initiating replacement therapy. METHODS: A one-year prospective follow-up study with 189 patients. Sociodemographic variables, aetiology of renal disease, comorbidities, prior nephrology service monitoring, prior renal transplantation and biochemical parameters at the time of initiating replacement therapy were analysed. RESULTS: The overall percentage of death during the one-year follow-up was 6.87%, with 64% of deaths occurring during the first six months. The only variable independently associated with mortality was low albumin levels. CONCLUSION: Although most patients in this centre are monitored by a nephrologist prior to starting replacement therapy, many nevertheless fail to achieve the biochemical targets recommended. One such parameter is albumin, which proved at the start of replacement therapy to be an independent predictor of mortality. Findings of this study show the need to intervene on certain biochemical parameters during the pre-dialysis stage and at the start of dialysis, in order to improve survival in this group of patients.

N2  - Decisions and discussions about the initiation of dialysis in the elderly are often challenging because of the high prevalence of comorbidities and frailty in this population. Mortality is high, functional decline is likely, and quality of life tends to be lower in the elderly on dialysis. It is thus important to counsel these patients on the risks, benefits, and burdens of dialysis to assist them in making an informed choice that is in line with their goals, preferences, and expectations. For some patients, dialysis may be a desirable choice. For others, the alternative of palliative care may provide a more favorable balance of benefits versus burdens. Elderly patients who choose to proceed with dialysis often benefit from an interdisciplinary team that helps to manage and monitor their health status, while maximizing the benefits of treatment and decreasing its potential harms. These goals can be promoted by effective communication and through individualized decisions about vascular access, medication choices, and dietary limitations. Finally, close monitoring of functional status will help to determine whether dialysis remains in a patient's best interest and when alternatives should be offered.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There is a need to improve end-of-life care for people with end-stage kidney disease, particularly due to the increasingly elderly, frail and co-morbid end-stage kidney disease population. Timely, sensitive and individualised Advance Care Planning discussions are acceptable and beneficial for people with end-stage kidney disease and can help foster realistic hopes and goals. AIM: To explore the experiences of people with end-stage kidney disease regarding starting haemodialysis, its impact on quality of life and their preferences for future care and to explore the Advance Care Planning needs of this population and the timing of this support. STUDY DESIGN: Semi-structured qualitative interview study of people receiving haemodialysis. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Recruitment ceased once data saturation was achieved. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20 patients at two UK National Health Service hospitals, purposively sampled by age, time on haemodialysis and symptom burden. RESULTS: Themes emerged around: Looking Back, emotions of commencing haemodialysis; Current Experiences, illness and treatment burdens; and Looking Ahead, facing the realities. Challenges throughout the trajectory included getting information, communicating with staff and the 'conveyor belt' culture of haemodialysis units. Participants reported a lack of opportunity to discuss their future, particularly if their health deteriorated, and variable involvement in treatment decisions. However, discussion of these sensitive issues was more acceptable to some than others. CONCLUSION: Renal patients have considerable unmet Advance Care Planning needs. There is a need to normalise discussions about preferences and priorities in renal and haemodialysis units earlier in the disease trajectory. However, an individualised approach is essential - one size does not fit all.

N2  - Background In Australia, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing steadily, especially amongst older people. The extent to which dialysis prolongs life and its effect on quality of life (QoL) of elderly patients who are frail or disabled also remains unclear. Patients and methods We conducted a single-centre, prospective study to compare the trajectory of symptom burden and functional status in elderly patients (age >65 years) with stage 5 CKD receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT), n=12, versus those managed conservatively without dialysis, n=8. Dialysis patients were younger (mean age 73(7) versus 84(6) years, p=0.001). Groups were similar at baseline in functional status, nutrition, co-morbidity and frailty assessments. All patients were still alive after six months. Results Dialysis patients reported a greater improvement in overall symptom scores by six months and no dialysis patient reported severe or overwhelming symptoms while one (13%) conservatively managed patient reported severe pruritus. There was no change in functional status in both groups over a six-month follow-up period. Conclusion We have contributed unique prospective longitudinal data showing the symptom and functional trajectory of a small group of elderly patients with CKD who have just been commenced on dialysis or referred to the renal supportive care clinic.

N2  - The current practice of hemodialysis for the frail elderly frequently ignores core bioethical principles. Lack of transparency and shared decision making coupled with financial incentives to treat have resulted in problems of overtreatment near the end of life. Imminent changes in reimbursement for hemodialysis will reverse the financial incentives to favor not treating high-risk patients. In this article, we describe what is empirically known about the approach to hemodialysis today, and how it violates four core ethical principles. We then discuss how the new financial system turns physician and organizational incentives upside down in ways that may exacerbate the ethical dilemmas, but in the opposite direction.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The present article provides an update on anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation in distinct clinical scenarios requiring particular considerations, such as ischaemic heart disease, electrical cardioversion, pulmonary vein ablation, the presence of valvular disease with or without prosthetic valves, and renal insufficiency, as well as old age and frailty. In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, the presence of renal insufficiency increases both thrombotic and haemorrhagic risk. In mild and moderate stages, direct-acting anticoagulants confer a greater benefit than warfarin, although they usually require dose adjustment. In renal failure/dialysis, there is no solid evidence that warfarin is beneficial and the use of direct-acting anticoagulants is not recommended. Because of its pathophysiology, oral anticoagulation could have a beneficial effect in patients with heart disease. However, vitamin K antagonists have not shown a satisfactory risk-benefit ratio. In contrast, direct-acting anticoagulants, at reduced doses, could have a beneficial effect in this scenario in association with antiplatelet agents. The use of direct-acting anticoagulants prior to electrical cardioversion in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation seems to be associated with a risk of cardioembolic events that is at least comparable to that of vitamin K antagonists. Their use avoids delay in the application of electrical cardioversion in patients without adequate INR levels. In the context of their use before and after atrial fibrillation ablation, dabiga-tran and rivaroxaban have demonstrated at least non-inferiority with vitamin K antagonists in terms of safety. In patients with any type or grade of valvular disease and atrial fibrillation, the indication of antithrombo-tic treatment must be evaluated in the same way as in patients with atrial fibrillation and no valvular di-sease. Whenever anticoagulation is required, direct-acting anticoagulants are the treatment of choice in nearly all situations, except in patients with mechanical valves or who have significant rheumatic mitral disease, who should be treated with vitamin K antagonists. The choice of appropriate antithrombotic stra-tegy in frail elderly patients is complex and involves multiple factors beyond assessment of embolic and haemorrhagic risk. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is essential for an individualised final decision. Moreover, any such decision should be consensus-based and periodically reviewed. Direct-acting anticoa-gulants could be the most beneficial alternative in most elderly patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

N2  - A 79-year-old moderately frail man with a history of graft replacement for descending thoracic aortic aneurysm and chronic kidney disease presented with the onset of haemoptysis. Computed tomography demonstrated aorto-oesophageal fistula secondary to aortic arch aneurysm rupture. Emergency surgery was performed through a median sternotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established via femoral artery inflow and bicaval venous drainage. After establishing circulatory arrest, the aortic arch was excised. Resection of the aortic aneurysm and debridement were performed during antegrade cerebral perfusion and lower body perfusion from femoral artery inflow using balloon occlusion of the previous graft. Aortic arch graft replacement with concomitant debridement of mediastinal tissue and direct repair of oesophageal perforation comprised a first-stage operation. Forty hours later, abundant irrigation of warm normal saline around the mediastinal cavity and the omental flap covering the graft and the repair site of the oesophagus comprised the second-stage operation. Although the postoperative course was complicated, the patient resumed oral intake within 2 months after the initial operation. Serial computed tomography and oesophageal endoscopy showed good healing of the aorto-oesophageal fistula. There were no clinical manifestations or imaging findings of deep mediastinal infection throughout the postoperative course.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Advanced age is one of the major determinants of frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis. However, multiple other factors contribute to frailty in these patients. The identification of frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis is critical as it influences the complexity of the anticoagulant treatment in this population at high risk of venous thromboembolism and bleeding. Factors that contribute to frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis include age, type of cancer, comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, poly-pharmacotherapy, treatment compliance, cognitive impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mobility, nutritional status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade, risk of falls, and reduced life expectancy. In the absence of specific clinical studies current anticoagulant treatment guidelines for the management are not fully applicable to frail patients with cancer. The anticoagulant treatment should therefore benefit from a tailored approach based on an algorithm that takes into account the specificities of the malignant disease.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients



N2  - BACKGROUND: Increasing the weekly frequency of hemodialysis sessions has positive effects, on the control of several biological data of patients. However, knowledge about Daily HemoDialysis (DHD) practices is limited in France. The aim of the present study was to describe the characteristics and treatment trajectories of all French patients undergoing DHD. METHODS: All patients older than 18 years who started DHD between 2003 and 2012 in France were included and followed until December 31, 2013. The patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment modalities were extracted from the French Renal Epidemiological and Information Network (REIN) registry. RESULTS: During the inclusion period, 753 patients started DHD in France. Based on their median age (64 years), patients were classified in two groups: "old" group (>/=64 years) and "young" group (<64 years). Patients in the old group had more comorbidities than in the young group: 48 % had diabetes (vs 29 % in the young group), 17 % an active malignancy (vs 10 %) and 80 % >/=1 cardiovascular disease (vs 41 %). Concerning patients' treatment trajectories, 496 (66 %) patients started with another dialysis before switching to DHD and 257 (34 %) directly with DHD. At the end of the follow-up, 69 % of patients in the old group were dead (27.4 % in the young group) and kidney transplantation was more frequent in the young group (30.4 % vs 0.5 %). CONCLUSION: In France, DHD is proposed not only to young in rather good clinical conditions and waiting for kidney transplantation, but also to old and frail patients with higher mortality.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder, which can potentially increases the risk of stroke by five-fold, thus, resulting in high public healthcare burden. Stroke prevention is vital in the management of AF patients. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA, eg, warfarin) have been the mainstay treatment to prevent ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism in AF patients for several decades. Despite the efficacy of warfarin, its limitations have recently driven the advent of some new antithrombotic agents, the non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOACs, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). The NOACs have changed the landscape for thromboembolic prophylaxis among patients with nonvalvular AF. Although three NOACs thus far (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) have been approved in Europe and the United States, for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF on the basis of several Phase III clinical trials, warfarin still remain important in preventing stroke for patients. This is especially true for those with optimal control of international normalized ratio with high (>70 %) time in therapeutic range, valvular AF or associated prosthetic valve. These NOACs are attractive alternatives for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF who are unable or unwilling to receive warfarin. However, several issues should be taken into consideration on safe and effective use of these NOACs in day-today clinical practice, for example, pharmacological properties, drug interactions, monitoring and compliance, and treatment of frail elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, etc. The decision about whether to initiate oral anticoagulation either with warfarin or NOACs should be patient-centered and after consideration of both stroke and bleeding risks. It is important for clinical practitioner to offer patients with AF an individualized decision about drug choice, making decision after adequate patient education plus discussion about the risks and benefits of these agents, thus fitting the drug to the patient profile.

N2  - Quality of life is particularly important for older patients with end-stage kidney disease, particularly when likely survival is short because of the burden of comorbidities. The features of old age and frailty make it difficult to cope with both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Evidence exists that quality of life is better on peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis, yet the majority of older patients are placed on hemodialysis. Older patients should therefore receive appropriate education to enable choice of the appropriate dialysis modality for their lifestyle. The development of assisted peritoneal dialysis will enable those who cannot perform their own dialysis to have their treatment at home. Delaying dialysis to a time when it is actually needed and discussing the option of conservative care will also improve the quality of the end-of-life phase for patients with multiple comorbidities and with a poor overall prognosis.

N2  - Background
Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations between
variability in a number of biological parameters and adverse outcomes.
As the variability may reflect impaired homeostatic regulation, we
assessed albumin variability over time in chronic hemodialysis (HD)
patients.
Methods
Data from 1346 subjects who received chronic HD treatment from May 2001
to February 2015 were analyzed according to three phases of HD
treatment: post-HD initiation, during maintenance HD treatment, and
before death. The serum albumin values were grouped according to the
time interval from HD initiation or death, and the yearly trends for
both the albumin levels and the intra-individual albumin variability
(quantified by the residual coefficient of variation: Alb-rCV) were
examined. The HD initiation and death-associated changes were also
analyzed using generalized additive mixed models. Furthermore, the
long-term trend throughout the maintenance treatment period was
evaluated separately using linear regression models.
Results
Albumin levels and variability showed distinctive changes during each of
the 3 periods. After HD initiation, albumin variability decreased and
reached a nadir within a year. During the subsequent maintenance
treatment period (interquartile range = 5.2-11.0 years), the log Alb-rCV
showed a significant upward trend (mean slope: 0.011 +/- 0.035/year),
and its overall mean was -1.49 +/- 0.08 (equivalent to an Alb-rCV of
3.22%). During the 1-2 years before death, this upward trend clearly
accelerated, and the mean log Alb-rCV in the last year of life was -1.36
+/- 0.17. The albumin levels and variability were negatively correlated
with each other and exhibited exactly opposite movements throughout the
course of chronic HD treatment. Different from the albumin levels,
albumin variability was not dependent on chronological age but was
independently associated with an individual's aging and death process.
Conclusion
The observed upward trend in albumin variability seems to be consistent
with a presumed aging-related decline in homeostatic capacity.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in  individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally, studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible short-term effects on markers of physical performance. SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

composite outcomes of all-cause death and cardiovascular hospitalizations
N2  - Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined as a multidimensional frailty score of >/= 10. The main outcome was the composite of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016. The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men. During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) disease management can improve health outcomes for older community dwelling patients with heart failure. HF disease management has not been studied in skilled nursing facilities, a major site of transitional care for older adults. METHODS AND ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The objective of this trial is to investigate if a HF- disease management program (HF-DMP) in skilled nursing facilities (SNF)s will decrease all-cause rehospitalizations for the first 60 days post-SNF admission. The trial is a randomized cluster trial to be conducted in 12 for-profit SNF in the greater Cleveland area. The study population is inclusive of patients with HF regardless of ejection fraction but excludes those patients on dialysis and with a life expectancy of 6 months or less. The HF-DMP includes 7 elements considered standard of care for patients with HF documentation of left ventricular function, tracking of weight and symptoms, medication titration, discharge instructions, 7-day follow-up appointment post-SNF discharge, and patient education. The HF-DMP is conducted by a research nurse tasked with adhering to each element of the program and regularly audited to maintain fidelity of the program. Additional outcomes include health status, self-care management, and discharge destination. CONCLUSIONS: The SNF-Connect Trial is the first trial of its kind to assess if a HF-DMP will improve outcomes for patients in SNFs. This trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness of HF-DMP to improve outcomes for older frail HF patients undergoing postacute rehabilitation.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: While the 11-factor modified frailty index (mFI-11) has been shown  to predict adverse outcomes in elderly patients undergoing surgery for hip fractures, the newer 5-factor index has not been evaluated in this population. The goal of this study is to evaluate the mFI-5 as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in elderly patients undergoing surgical management for hip fractures. METHODS: The NSQIP database was queried for patients aged 60 years and older who underwent surgical management for hip fractures between 2005-2016. The 5-factor score, which is comprised of diabetic status, history of COPD or current pneumonia, congestive heart failure, hypertension requiring medication, and non-independent functional status, was calculated for each patient. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between the mFI-5 and 30-day postoperative complications. RESULTS: 58,603 patients were identified. After adjusting for comorbidities, the mFI-5 was a strong predictor for total complications, serious medical complications (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, septic shock, pulmonary embolism, postoperative dialysis, reintubation, and prolonged ventilator requirement), surgical site infections, readmission, extended hospital length of stay, and mortality (p </= 0.008). For each point increase, the risk for any complication increased by 29.8%, serious medical complications 35.4%, surgical site infections 14.7%, readmission 24.6%, and mortality 33.7%. CONCLUSION: The mFI-5 is an independent predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality in elderly patients undergoing surgery for hip fractures. This clinical tool can be used by hospitals and surgeons to identify high-risk patients, accurately council patients and families with transparency, and guide perioperative care in order to optimize patient outcomes.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic dialysis have higher mortality in the United States than in many other countries. While increasing age, white race, male sex, and/or diabetes are considered risk factors for survival, few studies of older dialysis patients have simultaneously considered multiple predictor variables and their interactions. Using information contained in the 1982 to 1986 ESRD Network 20 database for Georgia and South Carolina, we studied hospitalizations and survival of 1,354 blacks and 965 whites who were age 60 years or older when they began dialysis therapy. Survival time was modeled using the Cox life-table regression method. Older blacks' median age at dialysis initiation was 67.4, compared with 68.7 for older whites (P = 0.001). Blacks were more likely than whites (P < 0.001) to have hypertension-related or diabetes-related ESRD. White patients experienced approximately 25% more hospitalization when adjustment was made for patient-days at risk. Separate multivariate survival models were required for patients with diabetes-related versus non-diabetes-related ESRD. Among diabetics, mortality was higher among whites and among patients who were older when they began dialysis. Among patients with non-diabetes-related ESRD, mortality was higher among patients who were older when they began dialysis, but the age effect was much stronger for white males. Our hospitalization and mortality data support the view that unmeasured severity (or frailty) differences characterize white as compared with black dialysis patients. Among non-diabetes-related ESRD patients, the age effect on survival was more severe in white males than in blacks or in white females. The high mortality we observed among older dialysis patients in Georgia and South Carolina warrants further study; the data may in part reflect patients' lower socioeconomic status compared with age, race, and sex-matched controls.

N2  - Background: Frailty can be defined as an inflammatory state with a loss of physiologic reserve in multiple systems that manifests as a decreased ability to respond to stressors that ultimately leads to an increased risk of adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the ease of frailty testing in a pre-kidney transplant clinic and the resources required to do so. A secondary goal was to better understand the utility of frailty testing when evaluating potential kidney transplant recipients. Methods: Frailty testing was conducted at a pre-kidney transplant clinic in three phases using Fried's frailty phenotype (shrinking, exhaustion, low physical activity, slowness, and grip strength). Results: A total of 132 frailty tests were completed on 128 patients. Frail patients had significantly higher rates of shrinking (26% vs. 8.5%, P < 0.05), exhaustion (82.6% vs. 27.6%, P < 0.05), low physical activity (78.2% vs. 19.0%, P < 0.05), slow walking (60.8% vs. 15.2%, P < 0.05), and grip strength (73.9% vs. 25.7%, P < 0.05). When comparing the listing of frail and non-frail patients for transplant, a significantly lower proportion of frail patients were listed compared to non-frail patients (30.4% vs. 57.6%, P < 0.05). Frailty testing was most complete when an examiner dedicated to frailty testing performed the testing. Conclusions: Frailty testing is feasible to complete in a pre-transplant clinic with an appropriate investment in personnel and resources.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Recurrent event data are commonly observed in biomedical longitudinal studies. In many instances, there exists a terminal event, which precludes the occurrence of additional repeated events, and usually there is also a nonignorable correlation between the terminal event and recurrent events. In this article, we propose a partly Aalen's additive model with a multiplicative frailty for the rate function of recurrent event process and assume a Cox frailty model for terminal event time. A shared gamma frailty is used to describe the correlation between the two types of events. Consequently, this joint model can provide the information of temporal influence of absolute covariate effects on the rate of recurrent event process, which is usually helpful in the decision-making process for physicians. An estimating equation approach is developed to estimate marginal and association parameters in the joint model. The consistency of the proposed estimator is established. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed approach is appropriate for practical use. We apply the proposed method to a peritonitis cohort data set for illustration.

N2  - Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are more and more prominent  medications in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), with five molecules commercialized and as many fixed-dose combinations with metformin. After failure of metformin monotherapy, gliptins compete with old medications such as sulphonylureas, on the one hand, or with new oral antidiabetic agents such as inhibitors of renal sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) (gliflozines), on the other hand. Another alternative is the use of an incretin mimetic (agonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors, to be injected subcutaneously) rather than an incretin enhancer such as a gliptin, before considering insulin therapy. This article analyses the arguments in favour of DPP-4 inhibitors. We will mainly consider the use of gliptins in patients with recently diagnosed T2D, in elderly and frail patients and in those with chronic kidney disease. To illustrate the discussion, we will analyze the results of both interventional and observational studies with vildagliptin. Obviously, these various groups of patients represent a large proportion of T2D population.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of low physiological reserve and multi-systemic dysregulation that leads to susceptibility to external stressors; it is associated with adverse outcomes. North American data suggest that haemodialysis recipients are more likely to be frail than the general population, although data on UK cohorts are lacking. Furthermore, with a multitude of assessment tools, it is difficult for the clinician to ascertain which is most suitable for this population. The FITNESS Study aims to measure the prevalence and outcomes associated with frailty in a large UK haemodialysis cohort to determine the optimum frailty tool as defined by predictive value for mortality/hospitalisation and to conduct a feasibility study exploring a multi-disciplinary clinical intervention to improve frailty among haemodialysis recipients. METHODS/DESIGN: The study will follow a cohort multiple randomised controlled trial design; the initial cohort study will identify participants to be invited into a subsequent open-label randomised controlled trial. Eligible patients will be identified and recruited from their usual haemodialysis session. They will be invited to complete tasks and questionnaires collecting data on sarcopenia, immunosenescence, mood, cognition, disability, and comorbidity. Fifty pre-frail participants with suitable English proficiency will be randomly selected from this cohort to participate in the randomised controlled trial phase of the study. Further stratified randomisation will occur to assign these 50 participants to active or passive groups. The active group will receive a psychologically supported, patient-centred, multi-disciplinary intervention into frailty, in what we believe to be a first within this patient group. The control group will receive usual haemodialysis standard of care. All participants will be followed up using electronic patient records for outcomes to include hospitalisation and mortality. Primary outcomes for this phase of the study will be feasibility and tolerability of the clinical intervention study. DISCUSSION: The study will collect data on multiple aspects of frailty allowing for a rich dataset for detailed analysis. We believe this will be the first study to explore a psychologically supported, patient-centred intervention in this patient group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03071107 .

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Today, old age does not represent a formal contraindication to kidney transplantation. Rather, there is evidence that in elderly patients renal transplantation offers longer life expectancy and better quality of life in comparison with dialysis. Yet, the results of renal transplantation in recipients older than 65years are inferior to those observed in younger adults, death with functioning graft representing a major cause of failure. Therefore, the selection of aged patients is of paramount importance. Apart from the routine clinical and biological investigations, three aspects have been relatively neglected by the transplant community and may require a careful analysis in elderly candidates to transplantation: the presence and degree of frailty, the presence of comorbidities and the adherence to prescriptions. Although there are rapid and simple tests for assessing the degree of frailty in the elderly, there is no clear cut-off value to decide whether a patient should be accepted or not. With advanced age the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular events and other diseases tend to increase. The use of combined age-comorbidity indices may be helpful to identify patients at high risk of mortality. Another critical point is the poor unintentional adherence to treatment, often caused by forgetfulness and mild cognitive impairment. These drawbacks may be further enhanced by a high number of pills to take and by changes in the dosage or type of prescriptions. A careful screening of the presence and degree of frailty, comorbidity and poor compliance to treatment is highly recommended before admitting older candidates to the waiting list for transplantation.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The literature reveals that current nephrology practice in obtaining informed consent for dialysis falls short of ethical and legal requirements. Meeting these requirements represents a significant challenge, especially because the benefits and risks of dialysis have shifted significantly with the growing number of older, comorbid patients. The importance of informed consent for dialysis is heightened by several concerns, including: (1) the proportion of predialysis patients and patients on dialysis who lack capacity in decision making and (2) whether older, comorbid, and frail patients understand their poor prognosis and the full implications to their independence and functional status of being on dialysis. This article outlines the ethical and legal requirements for a valid informed consent to dialysis: (1) the patient was competent, (2) the consent was made voluntarily, and (3) the patient was given sufficient information in an understandable manner to make the decision. It then considers the application of these requirements to practice across different countries. In the process of informed consent, the law requires a discussion by the physician of the material risks associated with dialysis and alternative options. We argue that, legally and ethically, this discussion should include both the anticipated trajectory of the illness and the effect on the life of the patient with particular regard to the outcomes most important to the individual. In addition, a discussion should occur about the option of a conservative, nondialysis pathway. These requirements ensure that the ethical principle of respect for patient autonomy is honored in the context of dialysis. Nephrologists need to be open to, comfortable with, and skillful in communicating this information. From these clear, open, ethically, and legally valid consent discussions, a significant dividend will hopefully flow for patients, families, and nephrologists alike.

N2  - Anemia is an important healthcare concern among the elderly. In these patients, the anemia is often mild, with a hemoglobin level >10 g/dL. It is usually well tolerated, but might be responsible for several proteiform and/or atypical presenting complaints. In the elderly, anemia is usually of multifactorial origin, including chronic inflammation, chronic kidney disease, nutrient deficiencies and iron deficiency (approximately two-thirds of all cases). The remaining cases are unexplained (unknown etiology). In the elderly, the classic diagnosis of anemia, which is based on the mean corpuscular volume associated with a low hemoglobin level, might not be accurate. A predefined standardized diagnostic procedure should be followed. In the common case of frail elderly patients, all investigations should be carefully considered and invasive examinations undertaken where justified (risk-benefit balance). Nevertheless, most cases of anemia require further investigation and the underlying cause should be identified and treated whenever possible.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Global burden disease studies point out that one of the top cause-specific anemias is iron deficiency (ID). Recent advances in knowledge of iron homeostasis have shown that fragile patients are a new target population in which the correction of ID might impact their morbidity, mortality and quality of life. We did a systematic review using specific search strategy, carried out the review of PubMed database, Cochrane Database of systemic reviews and international guidelines on diagnosis and clinical management of ID from 2010 to 2016. The International guidelines were limited to those with peer-review process and published in journal present in citation index database. The eligible studies show that serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are the key tests in early decision-making process to identify iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The clinician has to carefully consider fragile and high-risk subset of patients such as elders or individuals with chronic diseases (i.e chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic heart failure). Treatment is based on iron supplementation. Infusion route should be preferentially considered in frail patients especially in the view of new iron available formulations. The available evidences indicate that (i) recurrent IDA should always be investigated, considering uncommon causes; (ii) IDA might worse the performance and the clinical outcome of fragile and high-risk patients and require an intensive treatment.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Peritonitis is the most common infectious complication seen in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Traditionally, exit site infection (ESI) has been thought to predispose PD patients to peritonitis, although the risks have not been quantified. This study aimed to quantify the risk of PD peritonitis after ESI. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Data from 203 clinically stable PD patients >18 years of age who were followed as part of a randomized controlled trial over 18 months were used to estimate the risk of developing peritonitis within 30 days of an ESI compared with individuals who did not have a recent ESI. Sensitivity analyses were performed at 15, 45, and 60 days. RESULTS: Patients were mostly male (64.5%) and Caucasian, with a mean age of 60.5 +/- 14.4 years. There were 44 ESIs and 87 peritonitis episodes during the 18-month study. Seven patients had an ESI followed by peritonitis within 30 days. Using a frailty model, patients who had an ESI had a significantly higher risk of developing peritonitis within 30 days, even if the ESI was appropriately treated. This risk was maximal early on and diminished with time, with hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 11.1 at 15 days (HR=11.1, 95% CI=4.9-25.1), 5.3 at 45 days (2.5-11.3), and 4.9 at 60 days (2.4-9.9). In 2.3% of patients, subsequent peritonitis was caused by the same organism as the previous ESI. CONCLUSIONS: A strong association between a treated ESI and subsequent PD peritonitis was present up to 60 days after initial diagnosis.

N2  - CONTEXT: Coronary artery disease is highly prevalent among patients with end stage renal disease/hemodialysis (ESRD/HD) and coronary percutaneous interventions (PCI) has been increased by nearly 50% over the past decade. After PCI with stent placement, guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), but no specifically tailored pharmacotherapy approach is outlined for this frail population, mostly excluded from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We reviewed current evidences on the use of antiplatelet therapy in patients with ESRD/HD undergoing PCI, focusing on the efficacy and safety of specific agents and their indications for detailed clinical settings. RESULTS: Clinical setting in HD patients is the principal determinant of the type, onset, combination and duration of the DAPT. However, irrespective clinical setting, in addition to aspirin, clopidogrel is currently the most used antiplatelet agent even if no information derived from RCTs are available in ESRD. Due to the large experience acquired in routine clinical practice, the awareness of safety is higher for clopidogrel than newer antiplatelet agents. Because of lack of data, the use of prasugrel and ticagrelor is actually not recommended. However, in case of high ischemic and acceptable bleeding risk, they may be selectively used in ESRD/HD. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation might contribute to delineate the best treatment options for this high risk population.

5th World Congress on Controversies to Consensus in Diabetes, Obesity
and Hypertension (CODHy), Istanbul, TURKEY, NOV, 2015
N2  - Hypertension is very common in elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes.
The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes can be devastating to the
cardiovascular system, and in these patients, tight blood pressure (BP)
control is particularly beneficial. Little information is available
regarding the target BP levels in elderly hypertensive patients with
type 2 diabetes, and therefore extrapolation from data in the general
population should be done. However, it is difficult to extrapolate from
the general population to these frail individuals, who usually have
isolated systolic hypertension, comorbidities, organ damage,
cardiovascular disease, and renal failure and have a high rate of
orthostatic and postprandial hypotension. On the basis of the available
evidence, we provide arguments supporting the individualized approach in
these patients. Target BP should be based on concomitant diseases,
orthostatic BP changes, and the general condition of the patients. It is
recommended to lower BP in the elderly patient with diabetes to
<140-150/90 mmHg, providing the patient is in good condition. In
patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the same target is
reasonable providing the diastolic BP is >60 mmHg. In patients with
coronary artery disease and in patients with orthostatic hypotension,
excessive BP lowering should be avoided. In elderly hypertensive
patients with diabetes, BP levels should be monitored closely in the
sitting and the standing position, and the treatment should be tailored
to prevent excessive fall in BP.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis are typically characterized by multimorbidity and increasingly by advanced age; however, there are few data on their geriatric needs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of a large cohort of incident patients in ambulatory hemodialysis units with a particular focus on those aged over 80 years in Germany. METHODS: The electronic patient registry of the Board of Trustees (Kuratorium) for Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation (KfH) was searched for all patients who began hemodialysis in 1 of the 191 units between 2007 and 2013 and were 65 years and older. Patients were analyzed by age (65-79 years and >/=80 years) for clinical and biochemical characteristics, mortality, quality of life and hospitalizations. RESULTS: Of the 21,355 incident patients, a total of 13,872 (65%) were over 65 years old, with 9998 (46.8%) aged between 65 and 79 years and 3874 (18.1%) patients 80 years or older (oldest old). The spectrum of morbidity was comparable between the two age groups but there was a significantly higher prevalence of anemia, hypoalbuminemia and multimorbidity (>four comorbidities) in the older age group. Median survival was 4.5 years (1638 days) in the younger age group and 2.7 years (978 days) in the older group. Almost half of the patients experienced at least one episode of hospitalization during the first year but there were no significant differences between the age groups (45.9% in younger vs. 47% in older patients). In the older age group 463 (12%) patients survived more than 5 years after initiation of hemodialysis despite the presence of multiple risk factors for adverse clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: More than half of the chronic ambulatory hemodialysis patients were of advanced age and had a very high burden of multimorbidity. Nevertheless, a subgroup of ERSD patients over 80 years old survived at least 5 years on hemodialysis despite the presence of multiple risk factors for adverse clinical outcome. Identification of these patients as well as optimized care for frail hemodialysis patients will require application of geriatric assessment tools in addition to traditional parameters in nephrology. The development and validation of such tools should be the subject of further clinical studies.

N2  - The present increase in life span has been accompanied by an even higher
increase in the burden of comorbidity. The challenges to healthcare
systems are enormous and performance measures have been introduced to
make the provision of healthcare more cost-efficient. Performance of
hospitalisation is basically defined by the relationship between
hospital stay, use of hospital resources, and main diagnosis/diagnoses
and complication(s), adjusted for case mix. These factors, combined in
different indexes, are compared with the performance of similar
hospitals in the same and other countries. The reasons why an approach
like this is being employed are clear.
Cutting costs cannot be the only criteria, in particular in elderly,
high-comorbidity patients: in this population, although social issues
are important determinants of hospital stay, they are rarely taken into
account or quantified in evaluations. Quantifying the impact of the
``social barriers{''} to care can serve as a marker of the overall
quality of treatment a network provides, and point to specific
out-of-hospital needs, necessary to improve in-hospital performance. We
therefore propose a simple, empiric medico-social checklist that can be
used in nephrology wards to assess the presence of social barriers to
hospital discharge and quantify their weight.
Using the checklist should allow: identifying patients with social
frailty that could complicate hospitalisation and/or discharge;
evaluating the social needs of patient and entourage at the beginning of
hospitalisation, adopting timely procedures, within the partnership with
out-of-hospital teams; facilitating prioritization of interventions by
social workers.
The following ten items were empirically identified: reason for
hospitalisation; hospitalisation in relation to the caregiver's
problems; recurrent unplanned hospitalisations or early
re-hospitalisation; social/family isolation; presence of a dependent
relative in the patient's household; lack of housing or unsuitable
housing/accommodation; loss of autonomy; lack of economic resources;
lack of a safe environment; evidence of physical or psychological abuse.
The simple tool here described needs validation; the present proposal is
aimed at raising attention on the importance of non-medical issues in
medical organisation in our specialty, and is open to discussion, to
allow its refinement.

N2  - Background/Aims: We investigated factors associated with functional
performance in hemodialysis (HD) patients as well as their relationships
with mortality. Methods: We enrolled 790 HD patients who were followed
up from 2009 to 2013. Functional performance was evaluated by Karnofsky
Performance Status Scale (KPSS) scores. We examined the associations of
clinical variables and all-cause mortality with KPSS scores. Results:Of
the participants, 460 had high KPSS scores (range 90-100) and 330 had
low KPSS scores (below 80). On multivariate analysis, age and weekly HD
sessions were associated with significantly increased odds of a lower
KPSS score (age: OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04-1.07, p < 0.001; weekly HD: OR
2.10, 95% CI 1.37-3.21, p = 0.001). A low KPSS score was a significant
predictor of increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.49; 95% CI
1.02-2.16, p = 0.037), as determined using Cox regression analysis.
Conclusion: Functional performance was associated with clinical
variables and all-cause mortality in HD patients. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG,

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty assessment is recommended to evaluate the candidacy of adults referred for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Psoas muscle area (PMA) is an easily measured biomarker for frailty. There has yet to be a study examining the prognostic impact of PMA in OHT patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were retrieved for adults transplanted between 2000 and 2015 at a tertiary care hospital. Psoas muscle area was measured on a single axial image. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality over 6 years and a composite of in-hospital mortality or major morbidity (prolonged ventilation, stroke, dialysis, mediastinitis, or reoperation). RESULTS: Of 161 adult patients transplanted, 82 had at least 1 abdominal CT scan. At baseline, mean PMA was 25.7 +/- 5.8 cm in men and 16.0 +/- 3.6 cm in women, and decreased by 8% from the first to the last available CT scan. Adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and cardiomyopathy etiology, every 1-cm increase in PMA was found to be associated with a 9% reduction in long-term mortality (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-0.99; P = 0.031) and a 17% reduction in in-hospital mortality or major morbidity (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.96; P = 0.014). When PMA was smaller than the sex-specific median, the risk of mortality or major morbidity increased fourfold (odds ratio, 4.29; 95% CI, 1.19-15.46; P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Muscle mass is an independent predictor of mortality and major morbidity after OHT. Further research is needed to determine whether frail OHT patients with low PMA may benefit from muscle-building interventions to improve outcomes.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: The average age of the patients, introduced in the dialytic programme, is progressively increasing in relation to the prolonging of life and to the technological progresses. All this places the nephrologist to ask himself if the age has to be considered a limiting factor for the introduction of a patient in the dialytic programme. CASE REPORT: We report on a patient who started her dialytic programme when she was 95. After 5 years, at the age of 100, she uneventfully completed 60 months of haemodialytic treatment. Right from the start we decided to use as vascular access a double Tesio catheter, which was never replaced because it was the most appropriate for the patient's age. During the follow-up period the patient was not hospitalised and her clinical condition was satisfactory. DISCUSSION: According to the latest epidemiological and clinical data, this case emphasises the concept that it would be wrong to refuse the haemodialytic treatment to such patients only because of their frailty. Moreover, the lack of either univocal prognostic indications, based on scientific criteria, or special national laws confirm that the decision to treat the patient depends exclusively on the physician's ethical and professional background as well as the patient's autonomy and conscience.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: The usage of nursing home (NH) services is a marker of frailty among  older adults. Although the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) revised the Medical Evidence Report Form CMS-2728 in 2005 to include data collection on NH institutionalization, the validity of this item has not been reported. METHODS: There were 27,913 patients >/= 75 years of age with incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 2006, which constituted our analysis cohort. We determined the accuracy of the CMS-2728 using a matched cohort that included the CMS Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0, often employed as a "gold standard" metric for identifying patients receiving NH care. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the CMS-2728 NH item. Next, we compared characteristics and mortality risk by CMS-2728 and MDS NH status agreement. RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the CMS-2728 for NH status were 33%, 97%, 80% and 79%, respectively. Compared to those without the MDS or CMS-2728 NH indicator (No MDS/No 2728), multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for mortality associated with NH status were 1.55 (1.46 - 1.64) for MDS/2728, 1.48 (1.42 - 1.54) for MDS/No 2728, and 1.38 (1.25 - 1.52) for No MDS/2728. NH utilization was more strongly associated with mortality than other CMS-2728 items in the model. CONCLUSIONS: The CMS-2728 underestimated NH utilization among older adults with incident ESRD. The potential for misclassification may have important ramifications for assessing prognosis, developing advanced care plans and providing coordinated care.

N2  - A new study reports that 30.5% of kidney transplant recipients have an early hospital readmission (EHR; defined as within 30 days of discharge). As EHR is a strong independent risk factor for allograft loss and mortality, efforts should be made to implement and improve systems to minimize risk of EHR in these patients.

N2  - This paper charts the development of haemodialysis, the cornerstone of
renal replacement therapy (RRT). It has enabled patients with end-stage
renal failure to survive for years, in many cases with a surprisingly
good quality of life. Through technological advances, RRT can be offered
to patients who are older and more frail. Many have intercurrent
comorbid illness. Such patients can have good quality of life, but their
survival is shorter since they are likely to succumb early to comorbid
illnesses. The challenge to nephrologists is to provide treatment based
on exacting standards for all those patients who can benefit, yet to
maintain cost-effectiveness. There is increasing recognition that,
however good the technology underpinning dialysis, what justifies the
cost and commitment that dialysis entails is the provision for the
patient of a satisfactory quality of life.

N2  - Background: Mobility limitation is highly prevalent among older adults
and is central to the loss of functional independence. Dynamic
isokinetic muscle fatigue testing may reveal increased vulnerability to
disability and mortality beyond strength testing.
Methods: We studied community-dwelling older adults enrolled in the
Health Aging and Body Composition study (age range: 71-82) free of
mobility disability and who underwent isokinetic muscle fatigue testing
in 1999-2000 (n = 1,963). Isokinetic quadriceps work and fatigue index
was determined over 30 repetitions and compared with isometric
quadriceps maximum torque. Work was normalized to leg lean mass
accounting for gender-specific differences (specific work). The primary
outcome was incident persistent severe lower extremity limitation
(PSLL), defined as two consecutive reports of either having a lot of
difficulty or being unable to walk 1/4 mile or climb 10 steps without
resting. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality.
Results: There were 608 (31%) occurrences of incident PSLL and 488
(25%) deaths during median follow-up of 9.3 years. After adjustment,
lower isokinetic work was associated with significantly greater risks of
PSLL and mortality across the full measured range. Hazard ratios per
standard deviation lower specific isokinetic work were 1.22 (95% CI
1.12, 1.33) for PSLL and 1.21 (95% CI 1.13, 1.30) for mortality,
respectively. Lower isometric strength was associated with PSLL, but not
mortality. Fatigue index was not associated with PSLL or mortality.
Conclusions: Muscle endurance, estimated by isokinetic work, is an
indicator of muscle health associated with mobility limitation and
mortality providing important insight beyond strength testing.

N2  - Fixed-dose triple drug combinations represent one of the latest innovations of pharmacotherapy for hypertension (HT). They combine a traditional renin-angiotensin system blocker, a diuretic and a calcium channel blocker. The main benefit is the simplification of treatment regimen because 3 different agents are combined at different doses in a single pill. Improving adherence to treatment partly explains why this kind of combination may effectively reduce blood pressure (BP). BP lowering by a single- pill triple-drug combination can be approximately predicted, by using appropriate formulas described in previous meta-analysis of randomized trials. Thus, clinicians may select the appropriate dose for each of the combined drugs. Selection of different types of fixed-dose triple-drug combinations relies upon clinical experience, commercial availability and evidence from clinical trials and metaanalyses for each agent alone. However, triple fixed-dose drug combinations should be reserved only for patients with uncontrolled BP with 2 agents, poor adherence in complex therapeutic regimens or on inappropriate free-drug combinations. Also, triple therapy may help overcome clinical inertia by prescribing more potent antihypertensive formulations in one pill. In contrast, this type of multiple-drug fixed-dose combination might be less safe in very old and frail patients, as well as in those with chronic kidney disease. Although new combinations may help overcome the clinical inertia of achieving individualized BP targets, doctors should also pay attention reinforcement of lifestyle changes.

N2  - Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has spawned the evolution
of novel catheter-based therapies for a variety of cardiovascular
conditions. Newer device iterations are delivering lower peri-and early
post-procedural complication rates in patients with aortic stenosis, who
were otherwise deemed too high risk for conventional surgical valve
replacement. Yet beyond the post-procedural period, a considerable
portion of current TAVI recipients fail to derive a benefit from TAVI,
either dying or displaying a lack of clinical and functional
improvement. Considerable interest now lies in better identifying
factors likely to predict futility post-TAVI. Implicit in this are the
critical roles of frailty, disability, and a multimorbidity patient
assessment. In this review, we outline the roles that a variety of
medical comorbidities play in determining futile post-TAVI outcomes,
including the critical role of frailty underlying the identification of
patients unlikely to benefit from TAVI. We discuss various TAVI risk
scores, and further propose that by combining such scores along with
frailty parameters and the presence of specific organ failure, a more
accurate and holistic assessment of potential TAVI-related futility
could be achieved.

N2  - Introduction: Understanding the relationship between patient risk
factors, postoperative complications, and morbidity and mortality is
important when considering elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repair
(E-EVAR) performed to prevent aneurysm rupture mortality. We aimed to
stratify complications in E-EVAR and explore their relationship with
postoperative death.
Methods: E-EVAR cases from 2012 NSQIP were identified. 30-day
complications were categorized as major (MAJCX) or minor (MINCX) using
the Clavien-Dindo classification. Failure to rescue (FTR) was defined as
death following a complication. Univariate and multivariate analyses
were performed to identify associations between patient risk factors,
complications, and mortality. Significance set at P < 0.05.
Results: 3344 E-EVAR's were analyzed, with 155 (4.6%) MINCX, 106
(3.2%) MAJCX, and 39 (1.2%) mortality. Significant univariate risk
factors differed between MINCX (preoperative dyspnea 27% vs 19%, COPD
32% vs19%, HTN 87% vs 79%, functional dependence 9% vs 3%) and
MAJCX (female sex 33% vs 18%, preoperative diabetes 30% vs 17%,
dyspnea 40% vs 19%, COPD 46% vs 20%, anticoagulant use 20% vs 11%,
and functional dependence 13% vs 3%). 24 of 39 (62%) of deaths were
preceded by a complication. FTR was more frequent following MAJCX than
MINCX (16% vs 4.5%, P = 0.002), and occurred most commonly after renal
failure with dialysis (33% mortality with complication), cardiac arrest
(33%), septic shock (22%), and reintubation (22%). Independent
predictors of MAJCX included female sex (OR 2, P = 0.001), COPD (OR 2, P
= 0.009), and anticoagulant use (OR 2, P = 0.001). Mortality was
independently predicted by MAJCX (OR 29, P < 0.001), MINCX (OR 8, P <
0.001), and preoperative renal failure (OR 11.6, P < 0.001).
Conclusion: The majority of deaths within 30 days following E-EVAR are
preceded by a complication; both MAJCX and MINCX predict mortality. FTR
is more common after MAJCX; prevention efforts should take this into
account. Identified risk factors should be taken into consideration when
considering EEVAR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) varies markedly between Danish nephrology centres. The aim of the present study was to establish if there is regional and social variation in the incidence of chronic RRT in Denmark when analysed according to patient residence. The importance of diabetic nephropathy and patients aged 70 years or older was also studied. METHODS: Incident patients on chronic RRT in the period 1995-2006 were identified in the Danish National Registry on Regular Dialysis and Transplantation. Information on residence, income, educational status and ethnic origin was obtained from Statistics Denmark. Rates of incident RRT patients were standardized for regional differences of sex and age as well as income, educational status and ethnic origin. Poisson regression was used when comparing rates. RESULTS: Age- and sex-standardized incident chronic RRT rates among individuals with low income or short educational level were higher (P < 0.0001) compared to other groups. Also, standardized rates of patients in total and patients aged 70 years or older were higher in the catchment areas of the nephrology centres located in the two largest cities than for patients with residence in other areas of the country (P < 0.0001). Standardizing for regional differences of ethnic origin did not change the rates. The incident chronic RRT rate caused by diabetic nephropathy was higher for patients with residence in the catchment area of the nephrology centre in the largest city [49 per million people (p.m.p.) (95% CI = 40-57 p.m.p.)] compared to the catchment area of the nephrology centre located in the second largest city [31 (95% CI = 26-37 p.m.p.)] and other areas [29 p.m.p. (95% CI = 26-31 p.m.p.)] in 2001-06. When standardizing for differences in income among the 30-69-year-old persons, the rate of patients with residence in the catchment area of the nephrology centre located in the largest city decreased but was still higher than in other regions (P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: There are marked socio-economic and regional differences in rates of incident RRT patients. The rates of incident RRT patients are highest in the catchment areas of the two largest nephrology centres and this may be partly explained by a higher frequency of end-stage diabetic nephropathy and a new treatment programme targeting frail, mainly elderly, patients.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify four non-cancer populations  that might benefit from a palliative approach; and describe and compare the prevalence and patterns of dignity related distress across these diverse clinical populations. DESIGN: A prospective, multi-site approach was used. SETTING: Outpatient clinics, inpatient facilities or personal care homes, located in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with advanced Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD); and the institutionalized alert frail elderly. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: In addition to standardized measures of physical, psychological and spiritual aspects of patient experience, the Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI). RESULTS: Between February 2009 and December 2012, 404 participants were recruited (ALS, 101; COPD, 100; ESRD, 101; and frail elderly, 102). Depending on group designation, 35% to 58% died within one year of taking part in the study. While moderate to severe loss of sense of dignity did not differ significantly across the four study populations (4-11%), the number of PDI items reported as problematic was significantly different i.e. ALS 6.2 (5.2), COPD 5.6 (5.9), frail elderly 3.0 (4.4) and ESRD 2.3 (3.9) [p < .0001]. Each of the study populations also revealed unique and distinct patterns of physical, psychological and existential distress. CONCLUSION: People with ALS, COPD, ESRD and the frail elderly face unique challenges as they move towards the end of life. Knowing the intricacies of distress and how they differ across these groups broadens our understanding of end-of-life experience within non-cancer populations and how best to meet their palliative care needs.

N2  - This is a case study of two elderly, frail women in New York City who were recently rendered homeless. One woman had a massive tumor on her occipital scalp; the other was in renal failure. The obstacles and complexities of providing care to those with double jeopardy--being elderly and homeless--are described. There are enormous difficulties for placement into safe, supportive housing once people become homeless. The process is expensive and labor intensive. This can be complicated by the existence of mental illness. A New York agency that works with mentally ill homeless people is described. There are systemic obstacles as well: One woman loses her Medicaid when she moves from one state to another to be closer to her family. Another, 82 years old, is told to get a job so that she could qualify for Medicare. There are numerous contradictions and unnecessary costs in a fragmented health care system to which the obvious solution is a national single-payer system of care.

N2  - Metabolic acidosis is common in advanced chronic kidney disease and has been associated with a range of physiological derangements of importance to the health of older people. These include associations with skeletal muscle weakness, cardiovascular risk factors, and bone and mineral disorders that may lead to fragility fractures. Although metabolic acidosis is associated with accelerated decline in kidney function, end-stage renal failure is a much less common outcome in older, frail patients than cardiovascular death. Correction of metabolic acidosis using bicarbonate therapy is commonly employed, but the existing evidence is insufficient to know whether such therapy is of net benefit to older people. Bicarbonate is bulky and awkward to take, may impose additional sodium load with effects on fluid retention and blood pressure, and may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Trial data to date suggest potential benefits of bicarbonate therapy on progression of renal disease and nutrition, but trials have not as yet been published examining the effect of bicarbonate therapy across a range of domains relevant to the health of older people. Fortunately, a number of trials are now underway that should allow us to ascertain whether bicarbonate therapy can improve physical function, quality of life, and vascular, bone and kidney health in older people, and hence decide whether any benefits seen outweigh adverse effects and additional treatment burden in this vulnerable group of patients.

N2  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) increases markedly with
age. Anti diabetic treatment and the objectives of glycaemic control in
elderly patients with DM2 should be individualised according to their
biopsychosocial characteristics. In elderly patients for whom the
benefits of intensive antidiabetic treatment are limited, the basic
objectives should be to improve the quality of life, preserve
functionality and avoid adverse effects, especially hypoglycaemia.
Treatment of DM2 in the elderly was the subject of a consensus document
published in 2012 and endorsed by several Spanish scientific societies.
Since then, new therapeutic groups and evidence have emerged that
warrant an update to this consensus document. The present document
focuses on the therapeutic aspects of DM2 in elderly patients,
understood as being older than 75 years or frail. (C) 2017 Elsevier

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.

RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD. Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.

SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL outcomes remains to be determined.

N2  - AIMS: The Cockcroft-Gault (CG), the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)  and the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) formulae are often used to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The objective was to determine the best method for estimating GFR in older adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the geriatric wards of two hospitals in The Netherlands. Patients aged 70 years or above with an estimated (e)GFR below 60 ml min(-)(1) 1.73 m(-)(2) were included. The CG, CG calculated with ideal bodyweight (IBW), MDRD and CKD-EPI formulae were compared with a criterion standard, sinistrin clearance. Renal function was classified into five stages according to the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative chronic kidney disease classification, as follows (in ml min(-)(1) 1.73 m)(-)(2): stage 1, eGFR >/= 90; stage 2, eGFR of 60-89; stage 3, eGFR of 30-59; stage 4, eGFR of 15-29; and stage 5, eGFR < 15. RESULTS: Sixteen patients, 50% male, with a mean age of 82 years (range 71-87 years) and mean body mass index 26 kg m(-)(2) (range 18-36 kg m(-)(2)), were included. On average, all formulae slightly overestimated GFR, as follows (in ml min(-)(1) 1.73 m(-)(2): CG +0.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) -28 to +28]; CG with IBW +0.03 (95% CI -20 to +20); MDRD +9 (95% CI -16 to +34); and CKD-EPI +5 (95% CI -20 to +29). They classified kidney disease correctly in 68.8% (CG), 75% (CG with IBW), 43.8% (MDRD) and 68.8% (CKD-EPI) of the participants, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The CG, CG with IBW, MDRD and CKD-EPI formulae estimate the mean GFR of a population rather well. In individual cases, all formulae may misclassify kidney disease by one stage.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Renal disease is a common health condition that leads to loss of physical function, frailty, and premature loss of independence in addition to other severe comorbidities and increased mortality. Increased levels of physical activity and initiation of exercise training is recommended in the current guidelines for all patients with renal disease, but participation and adherence rates are low. The barriers to exercise and physical activity in patients with renal disease are not well defined and currently based on patient provider perception and opinion. There have been no published reviews that have synthesized published findings on patient reported barriers to exercise. This integrative literature review therefore aimed to identify the current understanding of patient reported barriers to regular exercise. This integrative review found that patient perceived barriers to exercise are not consistent with the barriers that have been identified by renal disease specialists and healthcare providers, which were disinterest, lack of motivation, and being incapable of exercise. The patient reported barriers identified through this review were complex and diverse, and the most frequently reported patient perceived barrier to exercise was low energy levels and fatigue. It is clear that additional research to identify patient perceived barriers to exercise is needed and that patient directed interventions to address these barriers should be developed. This integrative review provides information to the interdisciplinary nephrology team that can be used to tailor their assessment of barriers to exercise and provide exercise education for patients with renal disease.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction (sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42 % (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age, comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents. Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - Objectives: Acute kidney injury frequently complicates critical illness
and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Frailty is common
in critical illness survivors, but little is known about the impact of
acute kidney injury. We examined the association of acute kidney injury
and frailty within a year of hospital discharge in survivors of critical
illness.
Design: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study.
Setting: Medical/surgical ICU of a U.S. tertiary care medical center.
Patients: Three hundred seventeen participants with respiratory failure
and/or shock.
Interventions: None.
Measurements and Main Results: Acute kidney injury was determined using
Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stages. Clinical frailty status
was determined using the Clinical Frailty Scale at 3 and 12 months
following discharge. Covariates included mean ICU Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II score as well as baseline comorbidity (i.e., Charlson
Comorbidity Index), kidney function, and Clinical Frailty Scale score.
Of 317 patients, 243 (77%) had acute kidney injury and one in four
patients with acute kidney injury was frail at baseline. In adjusted
models, acute kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 were associated with
higher frailty scores at 3 months (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.14-3.24;
odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.31-4.42; and odds ratio, 4.41; 95% CI,
2.20-8.82, respectively). At 12 months, a similar association of acute
kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 and higher Clinical Frailty Scale score
was noted (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11-3.14; odds ratio, 1.81; 95%
CI, 0.94-3.48; and odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.34-5.66, respectively).
In supplemental and sensitivity analyses, analogous patterns of
association were observed.
Conclusions: Acute kidney injury in survivors of critical illness
predicted worse frailty status 3 and 12 months postdischarge. These
findings have important implications on clinical decision making among
acute kidney injury survivors and underscore the need to understand the
drivers of frailty to improve patient-centered outcomes.

N2  - Frailty engenders a recognizable clinical syndrome of vulnerability to
stressors related to impaired physiologic reserve that primarily occurs
among older adults, Features of frailty Include weight loss, exhaustion,
muscle weakness, performance Impairment, and cognitive slowing and can
be Identified Independent of comorbid conditions. Among frail older
adults, anemia prevalence Is markedly Increased, The Interaction between
anemia and frailty Is complex and confidently separating cause and
effect may not be possible. Nevertheless, anemia functions as a powerful
prognostic factor for the development of frailty related problems such
as muscle weakness, reduced performance, falls, and mortality. Further,
mildly reduced hemoglobin shows a similar association with adverse
outcomes, The date strongly Intimate that anemia predisposes or
accelerates the development of frailty. Anemia Interventional studies
are sorely needed to determine whether treatment may mitigate either the
development of frailty and/or the sequoia of frailty.

.
有點複雜，不知道到底frailty的complications有沒有
N2  - The equations for estimating kidney function have become very popular in
the last decade. However, the clinical and prognostic meaning of these
measures may be very different in older populations. Two cohorts of
people aged 65-89 years (older sample) and 90 or more (oldest old
sample) were used to investigate the prognostic significance of
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Additionally, we also
investigated whether combining frailty and eGFR may improve the accuracy
of frailty in predicting mortality. We found that lower eGFR values were
significantly more frequent among frail subjects in both groups. eGFR<30
was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality either in
subjects aged 6589 years (HR=3.71, 95% CI=1.23-11.2) or in those aged
90 or more (HR=1.53, 95% CI=1.05-2.23). In the latter group, a not
significant trend for increasing mortality was also observed among
people with eGFR>60 (HR=1.28, 95% CI=0.72-2.26). In addition, the
oldest old subjects with eGFR>60 and eGFR<30 had the lowest hand-grip
strength and ADL values. Combining eGFR and frailty status significantly
improved the accuracy of frailty in predicting mortality only in the
older sample. In conclusion, a U-shaped relationship exists between eGFR
and mortality in the oldest old, but not in older individuals. Our
findings suggest that eGFR needs to be adjusted for muscle mass/physical
performance when estimating kidney function in people aged 90 or more.
Nevertheless, in subjects aged 65-89 years, eGFR may improve the
accuracy of frailty status in predicting prognosis, thus suggesting that
eGFR may represent an additional dimension of frailty syndrome.

N2  - This study aims to analyze the impact of frailty, multimorbidity and
disability on the survival of elderly people attended in a geriatric
outpatient facility, and identify the clinical risk factors associated
with death. It is a longitudinal study, with 133 elderly people
initially evaluated in relation to frailty, multimorbidity (simultaneous
presence of three or more chronic diseases) and disability in Daily Life
Activities. The Kaplan Meier method was used to analyze survival time,
and the Cox regression was used for association of the clinical factors
with death. In follow-up over six years, 21.2% of the participants
died, survival being lowest among those who were fragile (p < 0.05). The
variables frailty (HR = 2.26; CI95%: 1.03-4.93) and Chronic Renal
Insufficiency (HR = 3.00; CI95%: 1.20-7.47) were the factors of highest
risk for death in the multivariate analysis. Frailty had a negative
effect on the survival of these patients, but no statistically
significant association was found in relation to multimorbidity or
disability. Tracking of vulnerabilities in the outpatient geriatric
service is important, due to the significant number of elderly people
with geriatric syndromes that use this type of service, and the taking
of decisions on directions for care of these individuals.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Patients with chronic kidney disease experience substantial loss of muscle mass,  weakness, and poor physical performance. As kidney disease progresses, skeletal muscle dysfunction forms a common pathway for mobility limitation, loss of functional independence, and vulnerability to disease complications. Screening for those at high risk for mobility disability by self-reported and objective measures of function is an essential first step in developing an interdisciplinary approach to treatment that includes rehabilitative therapies and counseling on physical activity. Exercise has beneficial effects on systemic inflammation, muscle, and physical performance in chronic kidney disease. Kidney health providers need to identify patient and care delivery barriers to exercise in order to effectively counsel patients on physical activity. A thorough medical evaluation and assessment of baseline function using self-reported and objective function assessment is essential to guide an effective individualized exercise prescription to prevent function decline in persons with kidney disease. This review focuses on the impact of kidney disease on skeletal muscle dysfunction in the context of the disablement process and reviews screening and treatment strategies that kidney health professionals can use in clinical practice to prevent functional decline and disability.

N2  - Following a total hip arthroplasty (THA), early hospital re-admission
rates of 3-11% are considered as `acceptable' in terms of medical care
cost policies. Surprisingly, the impact of re-admissions on mortality
has not been priorly portrayed. Therefore, we sought to determine the
mortality rate after 90-day re-admissions following a THA in a series of
patients from a captive medical care program.
We prospectively analysed 90-day readmissions of 815 unilateral,
elective THA patients operated upon between 2010 and 2014 whose medical
care was the one offered by our institution. We stratified our sample
into readmitted and non-readmitted cohorts. Through a Cox proportional
hazards model, we compared demographic characteristics, clinical
comorbidities, surgical outcomes and laboratory values between both
groups in order to determine association with early and late mortality.
We found 37 (4.53%) re-admissions at a median time of 40.44 days (IQR
17.46-60.69). Factors associated with re-admission were hospital stay (p
= 0.00); surgical time (p = 0.01); chronic renal insufficiency (p =
0.03); ASA class 4 (p = 0.00); morbid obesity (p = 0.006); diabetes (p =
0.04) and a high Charlson index (p = 0.00). Overall mortality rate of
the series was 3.31% (27/815). Median time to mortality was 455.5 days
(IQR 297.58-1170.65). One-third (11/37) of the re-admitted patients
died, being sepsis non-related to the THA the most common cause of
death. After adjusting for confounders, 90-day re-admissions remained
associated with mortality with an adjusted HR of 3.14 (CI95% 1.05-9.36,
p = 0.04).
Unplanned re-admissions were an independent risk factor for future
mortality, increasing three times the risk of mortality.

N2  - Dialysis care is often associated with poor outcomes including low quality of life (QOL). To improve patient-reported outcomes, incorporation of the patient's needs and perspective into the medical care they receive is essential. This article provides a framework to help clinicians integrate symptom assessment and other measures such as QOL and frailty scores into a clinical approach to the contemporary supportive care of patients with advanced CKD. This approach involves (1) defining our understanding of kidney supportive care, patient-centered dialysis, and palliative dialysis; (2) understanding and recognizing common symptoms associated with advanced CKD; (3) discussing the concepts of physical function, frailty, and QOL and their role in CKD; and (4) identifying the structural and process barriers that may arise when patient-centered dialysis is being introduced into clinical practice.

N2  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF), two problems of growing prevalence as a consequence of the ageing population, are associated with high morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. AF and HF also share common risk factors and pathophysiologic processes such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and valvular heart disease often occur together. Although elderly patients with both HF and AF are affected by worse symptoms and poorer prognosis, there is a paucity of data on appropriate management of these patients. Methods: PubMed was searched for studies on AF and older patients using the terms atrial fibrillation, elderly, heart failure, cognitive impairment, frailty, stroke, and anticoagulants. Results: The clinical picture of HF patients with AF is complex and heterogeneous with a higher prevalence of frailty, cognitive impairment, and disability. Because of the association of mental and physical impairment to nonadministration of oral anticoagulants (OACs), screening for these simple variables in clinical practice may allow better strategies for intervention in this high‐risk population. Since novel direct OACs (NOACs) have a more favorable risk‐benefit profile, they may be preferable to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in many frail elderly patients, especially those at higher risk of falls. Moreover, NOACs are simple to administer and monitor and may be associated with better adherence and safety in patients with cognitive deficits and mobility impairments. Conclusions: Large multicenter longitudinal studies are needed to examine the effects of VKAs and NOACs on long‐term cognitive function and frailty; future studies should include geriatric conditions.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The RRC Staff Assisted Home Hemodialysis Program started in September 2013 with the target of improving care for the frail elderly residents in skilled facilities by offering hemodialysis in their home setting. Residents all receive short time, frequent dialysis. The residents no longer need to be transported to a local dialysis center three times per week in all types of weather and subject to long waits by the transport company. In addition, Medicare/Medicaid save significant dollars on transportation expenses. Residents needing rehabilitation services can receive their therapy while their dialysis schedule is adjusted around the resident's therapy. Residents no longer miss meals and medications or family visits. Collaboration between RRC and the skilled facility is patient centric whereby the care of each patient is consistent and individualized. The most meaningful measure of the success of this program is the residents themselves. They have self-reported how much better they feel with more energy. The residents can increase their socialization activities within the skilled facility. The dietitians report that the residents are eating better because there are fewer restrictions on foods and fluids.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although individuals with kidney disease, including those dependent on dialysis, often present clinically with signs and symptoms consistent with frailty, there is limited information about sociodemographic and clinical risk factors that may be associated. METHODS: Seven hundred forty-five patients undergoing hemodialysisbetween 2009 and 2011 in 7 Atlanta dialysis clinics and 7 San Francisco bay area dialysis clinics were assessed using the validated Fried frailty index (recent unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk speed, low physical activity) that defines frailty as the presence of 3 or more criteria. Study coordinators interviewed participants; measured grip strength, walk speed, and body composition; and reviewed records for clinical and laboratory parameters. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of patient characteristics with frailty. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, peripheral vascular disease and cardiac diseases, including dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, pericarditis, and cardiac arrest, were associated with higher odds for frailty, whereas black race and higher serum albumin concentration were associated with lower odds for frailty. CONCLUSIONS: In multivariable analyses, the risk for frailty in patients undergoing hemodialysis, as assessed by the presence of 3 or more criteria that comprise the Fried frailty index, was increased in association with peripheral vascular disease and cardiac conditions, such as dysrhythmia and atrial fibrillation, and was decreased for those with higher serum albumin concentration and for blacks compared with whites. Among patients who met the Fried definition of frailty, 78% scored as frail on walk speed and 56% scored as frail on grip strength, the 2 physical performance measures.

Patients were analyzed by age (65-79 years and ≥80 years) for clinical and biochemical characteristics, mortality, quality of life and hospitalizations.; Results: Of the 21,355 incident patients, a total of 13,872 (65%) were over 65 years old, with 9998 (46.8%) aged between 65 and 79 years and 3874 (18.1%) patients 80 years or older (oldest old). The spectrum of morbidity was comparable between the two age groups but there was a significantly higher prevalence of anemia, hypoalbuminemia and multimorbidity (>four comorbidities) in the older age group. Median survival was 4.5 years (1638 days) in the younger age group and 2.7 years (978 days) in the older group. Almost half of the patients experienced at least one episode of hospitalization during the first year but there were no significant differences between the age groups (45.9% in younger vs. 47% in older patients). In the older age group 463 (12%) patients survived more than 5 years after initiation of hemodialysis despite the presence of multiple risk factors for adverse clinical outcome.; Conclusion: More than half of the chronic ambulatory hemodialysis patients were of advanced age and had a very high burden of multimorbidity. Nevertheless, a subgroup of ERSD patients over 80 years old survived at least 5 years on hemodialysis despite the presence of multiple risk factors for adverse clinical outcome. Identification of these patients as well as optimized care for frail hemodialysis patients will require application of geriatric assessment tools in addition to traditional parameters in nephrology. The development and validation of such tools should be the subject of further clinical studies.;

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Non-dialysis care (NDC) is the provision of all aspects of renal care except for  the dialysis process. While the nomenclature may vary, with terms such as 'conservative care', 'maximal conservative management' or 'non-dialytic treatment' having been associated with NDC, the clinical principle is to provide comprehensive care to patients who opt to forgo dialysis despite increasing uraemic symptoms. NDC therapies focus on pain relief, the use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents, anti-pruritics and anti-nausea therapies, with lower emphasis on strategies used to modulate the rate of renal progression. Patient selection remains the most challenging aspect of developing an NDC program, with selection often being based on physician instinct, family principles and population-based prognostic risk measures. Outcomes are fair with a significant proportion of NDC patients experiencing lower hospitalization days and higher rates of death at home (or in a preferred environment) rather than in acute-care hospitals.

N2  - Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis are
typically characterized by multimorbidity and increasingly by advanced
age; however, there are few data on their geriatric needs.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of a
large cohort of incident patients in ambulatory hemodialysis units with
a particular focus on those aged over 80 years in Germany.
The electronic patient registry of the Board of Trustees (Kuratorium)
for Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation (KfH) was searched for all
patients who began hemodialysis in 1 of the 191 units between 2007 and
2013 and were 65 years and older. Patients were analyzed by age (65-79
years and >= 80 years) for clinical and biochemical characteristics,
mortality, quality of life and hospitalizations.
Of the 21,355 incident patients, a total of 13,872 (65%) were over 65
years old, with 9998 (46.8%) aged between 65 and 79 years and 3874
(18.1%) patients 80 years or older (oldest old). The spectrum of
morbidity was comparable between the two age groups but there was a
significantly higher prevalence of anemia, hypoalbuminemia and
multimorbidity (> four comorbidities) in the older age group. Median
survival was 4.5 years (1638 days) in the younger age group and 2.7
years (978 days) in the older group. Almost half of the patients
experienced at least one episode of hospitalization during the first
year but there were no significant differences between the age groups
(45.9% in younger vs. 47% in older patients). In the older age group
463 (12%) patients survived more than 5 years after initiation of
hemodialysis despite the presence of multiple risk factors for adverse
clinical outcome.
More than half of the chronic ambulatory hemodialysis patients were of
advanced age and had a very high burden of multimorbidity. Nevertheless,
a subgroup of ERSD patients over 80 years old survived at least 5 years
on hemodialysis despite the presence of multiple risk factors for
adverse clinical outcome. Identification of these patients as well as
optimized care for frail hemodialysis patients will require application
of geriatric assessment tools in addition to traditional parameters in
nephrology. The development and validation of such tools should be the
subject of further clinical studies.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The first treatment which slows the course of polycystic kidney disease is now available in Switzerland. There is no benefit of immunosuppression when treating IgA nephropathy. Rituximab has been proved effective in the treatment of membranous nephropathy. When to start renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury ? The debate still continues. In selected patients with end-stage renal failure, starting with twice a week hemodialysis is a desirable option. Peritoneal dialysis can be considered in frail patients. Better being transplanted with a HLA-incompatible living donor than to be on the waiting list. Immunosuppression without a calcineurin inhibitor is a potential immunologic hazard even for stable transplants. Long-term results of belatacept-based immunosuppression instead of cyclosporin showed better graft and patient survival but more acute rejection.

N1  - did not measure frailty in patients with CKD
N2  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney failure. METHODS: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults with end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South America designed to examine the association between periodontitis and all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis. Participants were matched 1:1 on their propensity score for moderate to severe periodontitis assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries. RESULTS: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score methods to generate a matched cohort of participants with periodontitis similar to those with none or mild periodontal disease, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were not changed substantially when participants were limited to those with 12 or more natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes of cardiovascular death. CONCLUSION: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of early death in adults treated with hemodialysis.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - The population of patients with moderate and severe CKD is growing. Frail and older patients comprise an increasing proportion. Many studies still exclude this group, so the evidence base is limited. In 2013 the advisory board of ERBP initiated, in collaboration with European Union of Geriatric Medicine Societies (EUGMS), the development of a guideline on the management of older patients with CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73 m2). The full guideline has recently been published and is freely available online and on the website of ERBP (www.european-renal-best-practice.org). This paper summarises main recommendations of the guideline and their underlying rationales.

as the number of complications increases, so increases the frailty level
N2  - Objective: to assess the frail level of the elderly with chronic kidney disease under conservative treatment. Methods: this is a cross-sectional and correlational study performed with 35 elderly. The frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale instrument. A descriptive analysis and Spearman correlation coefficients were performed. Results: the frailty showed a minimal variation of 1 and maximum of 14, with a mean score 7.71 ( 3.10). Women (8.05 +/- 3.551) and illiterates (9.57 +/- 2.637) showed a higher mean score of frail. By correlating the frail score, a moderate inverse correlation was found with years of study (p=0.033) and moderate positive correlation with some complications (p<0.05). Conclusion: the elderly with chronic kidney disease under conservative treatment showed some frailty degree, the highest levels were correlated with lower education and a higher number of clinical complications.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Incidence rates of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) vary geographically not only between but within countries. This study uses data from the French REIN registry to quantify the extent to which socio-economic environment, health care supply and medical practice patterns such as early dialysis initiation or greater propensity to accept frail or elderly patients for dialysis, may explain spatial patterns of ESRD incidence in 85 French districts. METHODS: The association between age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates of RRT in 2008-09 and 17 indicators was explored at the district level with geographically appropriate methods, before and after controlling for the effects of diabetes and the other significant indicators. Rate ratios (RR) and credible intervals (CI) were estimated for a 1-SD increase of each covariate. RESULTS: Crude RRT incidence by district ranged from 85.8 to 225.5 per million inhabitants. The age- and sex-adjusted RRT incidence increased with the proportion of people unemployed (RR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09), the population density (RR: 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12) and the prevalence of diabetes (RR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.12). It also increased with the proportions of incident ESRD patients >85 years (RR: 1.02, 95% CI 0.99-1.06), of deaths within the first 3 months of RRT (RR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.0-1.06) and of nephrologists in private practice (RR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08) and with the median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis initiation (RR: 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.09). CONCLUSION: This study confirms that socio-economic factors and diabetes explain substantial between-area variations in RRT incidence and highlights the variability of practice patterns, especially decisions about RRT and their potential impact on incidence.

N2  - Background and Methods: We aimed to compare functional status in men and women on the liver transplant (LT) wait‐list. Consecutive adult outpatients (n=340) listed for LT at one center (96% recruitment rate) underwent 4 frailty/functional impairment assessments at a single time point: Fried Frailty, gait speed, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and Instrumental ADL (IADL) scales. Chi‐square and Kruskal‐wallis tests compared differences by gender. Using competing risks models, we assessed the association between the Fried Frailty Instrument and wait‐list mortality (death/delisting for being too sick for LT) given its validity and prognostic utility in other non‐elderly populations. Results: Of 340 LT candidates, 33% were women. Men and women were similar by median follow up (11 vs 10mo), age (60 vs 60yr), body mass index (29 vs 28), %ascites (34 vs 36), %encephalopathy (17 vs 19) [p>0.05], but differed by %HCC (31 vs 18), %hypertension (48 vs 36), bilirubin (2.2 vs 2.6 mg/dL), creatinine (1.0 vs 0.9 mg/dL), %on dialysis (3 vs 7), MELD [15 (IQR 12‐18) vs 15 (13‐19)] [p<0.05 for each]. Women displayed higher rates of functional impairment (Table). Wait‐list mortality occurred in 20% frail and 10% not frail candidates (p=0.046). Death/delisting occurred in 9% of non‐frail women, 9% of frail women, 11% of non‐frail men, but 27% of frail men (p=0.03). Compared to non‐frail women, frail men had a 3.4 fold increased risk of wait‐list mortality (Figure). Conclusions: Among LT candidates, women display higher rates of functional impairment than men. Frailty is a stronger predictor of wait‐list mortality in men, independent of MELD score. (Figure Presented).

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fluid overload and intradialytic hypotension are associated with cardiovascular events and mortality in patients on hemodialysis. We investigated associations between hemodialysis facility practices related to fluid volume and intradialytic hypotension and patient outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Data were analyzed from 10,250 patients in 273 facilities across 12 countries, from phase 4 of the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS; 2009-2012). Cox regression models (shared frailty) were used to estimate associations between facility practices reported by medical directors in response to the DOPPS Medical Directors Survey and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization, and cardiovascular events, adjusting for country, age, sex, dialysis vintage, predialysis systolic BP, cardiovascular comorbidities, diabetes, body mass index, smoking, residual kidney function, dialysis adequacy, and vascular access type. RESULTS: Of ten facility practices tested (chosen a priori), having a protocol that specifies how often to assess dry weight in most patients was associated with lower all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 99% confidence interval [99% CI], 0.64 to 0.94) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.72; 99% CI, 0.55 to 0.95). Routine orthostatic BP measurement to assess dry weight was associated with lower all-cause hospitalization (HR, 0.86; 99% CI, 0.77 to 0.97) and cardiovascular events (HR, 0.85; 99% CI, 0.73 to 0.98). Routine use of lower dialysate temperature to limit or prevent intradialytic hypotension was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.76; 99% CI, 0.58 to 0.98). Routine use of an online volume indicator to assess dry weight was associated with higher all-cause hospitalization (HR, 1.19; 99% CI, 1.02 to 1.38). Routine use of sodium modeling/profiling to limit or prevent intradialytic hypotension was associated with higher all-cause mortality (HR, 1.36; 99% CI, 1.14 to 1.63), cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.34; 99% CI, 1.04 to 1.73), and cardiovascular events (HR, 1.21; 99% CI, 1.03 to 1.43). CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis facility practices relating to the management of fluid volume and intradialytic hypotension are associated with patient outcomes.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Recurrent event data arise in longitudinal follow-up studies, where each subject  may experience the same type of events repeatedly. The work in this article is motivated by the data from a study of repeated peritonitis for patients on peritoneal dialysis. Due to the aspects of medicine and cost, the peritonitis cases were classified into two types: Gram-positive and non-Gram-positive peritonitis. Further, since the death and hemodialysis therapy preclude the occurrence of recurrent events, we face multivariate recurrent event data with a dependent terminal event. We propose a flexible marginal model, which has three characteristics: first, we assume marginal proportional hazard and proportional rates models for terminal event time and recurrent event processes, respectively; second, the inter-recurrences dependence and the correlation between the multivariate recurrent event processes and terminal event time are modeled through three multiplicative frailties corresponding to the specified marginal models; third, the rate model with frailties for recurrent events is specified only on the time before the terminal event. We propose a two-stage estimation procedure for estimating unknown parameters. We also establish the consistency of the two-stage estimator. Simulation studies show that the proposed approach is appropriate for practical use. The methodology is applied to the peritonitis cohort data that motivated this study.

N2  - Background: The National Heart Failure UK Audit (2011/2012) recommends cardiology services should manage in-hospital heart failure, demonstrating better survival outcomes. However frail older peoples' needs were not reflected; cognitive impairment and multi-morbidity were excluded. Our objective was to survey our older patients' characteristics and management for acute heart failure admission.Sampling methods: We sampled forty-five patients admitted to the Older Persons' Unit with heart failure (January-March 2013) collecting data from case notes and discharge summaries, adapting the National Heart Failure Audit tool adding domains including cognition, non-cardiac co-morbidities and dependency.Results: Mean age 86yrs old, mean length of stay 22 days, 62% (28/45) had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Most lived alone 62% (28/45). 32% (14/44) scored less than 24/30 on mini-mental state examination. Non-cardiac diseases were common; dementia 22% (10/45), chest disease 22% (10/45), diabetes mellitus 24% (11/45), stroke 18% (8/45), chronic kidney disease 31% (14/45). Admission echocardiography performed in 67% (30/45), brain natriuretic peptide level in 71% (32/45). In patients with reduced ejection fraction, 85% (11/13) were discharged on a beta-blocker. Only 38% (5/13) were discharged on an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor; of those who were not 50% (4/8) had significant hypotension, 38% (3/8) had significant acute kidney injury.Key conclusions: Cognitive impairment and co-morbidity burden was common. Not everyone received evidence-based medical therapy, mostly clinically justified. Without considering co-morbidity, frailty and medication intolerance, streamlining services to a specialist approach may be detrimental to the complex frail patient. The National Heart Failure Audit should incorporate these aspects to reflect older patients' needs.

N2  - Older adults (aged ≥65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging. Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death. Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to identify opportunities to intervene.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - Adverse drug effects as a consequence of inappropriate dosage are a
common cause of hospitalization among the elderly. Older individuals are
at a particular risk of overdosing because their kidney function
decreases with advancing age and the elderly are often prescribed
several pharmaceutical drugs. In addition, serum creatinine levels
decrease owing to a reduction in muscle mass with age. Therefore, drug
dosing based on the serum creatinine level only, instead of using
assessment of the renal function, may result in overdosing of frail
elderly patients. Renal function, i.e., the glomerular filtration rate
can, with simple formulas, be estimated from analysis of creatinine
and/or plasma cystatin C (eGFR). Such estimations performed with modern
and validated formulas, as a rule present renal function normalized to
the body surface area (mL/min/1.73 m(2)). A good estimation of how much
the normal dosing interval should be prolonged, or the dose reduced, to
obtain a desired plasma concentration of drugs that are mainly
eliminated by glomerular filtration can be obtained by calculating the
ratio between the patient's eGFR and the normal renal function (about
90-125 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Increased knowledge and use of eGFR by
prescribing physicians will reduce the risk of overdosing drugs in the
elderly.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Antihypertensive treatment is aimed at reducing as much as possible health outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. The main international guidelines and clinical trials showed different positions about blood pressure targets. At present, there is no common opinion about the benefits of an aggressive drug treatment; moreover it is not clear whether lower blood pressure values are related to increased morbidity and mortality. The recent randomized SPRINT trial has compared intensive vs standard drug therapy in a non-diabetic hypertensive population. The trial has shown benefits of intensive treatment in reducing important health outcomes, though results were not confirmed in several patient subsets. We examined the studies on hypertensive patients with comorbidities (i.e., chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) to identify blood pressure targets recommended in these populations, but no strong evidence was found about the benefits of intensive treatment. In geriatric patients the "lower is better" paradigm cannot be entirely applied because of comorbidity, polypharmacy and frailty.

N2  - Objective: This study determined whether frailty provides incremental
value to the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II in
identifying patients at risk of poor 1-year functional survival.
Methods: This prospective study in patients undergoing cardiac surgery
defined frailty using 3 common definitions: (1) the Modified Fried
Criteria; (2) the Short Physical Performance Battery; and (3) the
Clinical Frailty Scale. The primary outcome was functional survival,
defined as being alive at 1 year postsurgery with a health-related
quality of life score greater than 60 on the EuroQol-Visual Analogue
Scale.
Results: Of the 188 participants, 49.5%, 52.6%, and 31.9% were deemed
frail according to the Modified Fried Criteria, Short Physical
Performance Battery, and Clinical Frailty Scale, respectively. The
median age of our cohort was 71.0 years (29.3% female). The probability
of functional survival at 1 year for the entire cohort was 73.9%. After
adjusting for the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation
II, patients deemed frail under the Modified Fried Criteria, Short
Physical Performance Battery, and Clinical Frailty Scale had an
increased odds ratio for poor functional survival of 3.44, 3.47, and
2.08, respectively. When compared with the European System for Cardiac
Operative Risk Evaluation II alone, the Modified Fried Criteria, Short
Physical Performance Battery, and Clinical Frailty Scale showed an
absolute improvement in the discrimination slope of 6.7%, 6.5%, and
2.4% with a category-free classification improvement of 59.6%, 59.2%,
and 35.1%, respectively.
Conclusions: Preoperative frailty was associated with a 2-to 3.5-fold
higher risk of poor functional survival 1 year after cardiac surgery.
The addition of frailty to the European System for Cardiac Operative
Risk Evaluation II provides incremental value in identifying patients at
risk of poor functional survival 1 year postsurgery, regardless of
frailty definition.

N2  - Patients on dialysis are considered to be at high risk of adverse drug
effects. The fact that these patients are often old and frail means that
they require special attention. In this population, the main cause of
mortality is cardiovascular disease followed by infection. Moreover,
progress remains to be done in terms of the dietary management of these
patients given that hypoalbuminaemia and nutritional status are
significant prognostic factors of mortality with dialysis. It is in
these three areas which have an impact on survival that the pharmacist
can support the nephrologist, by assuring in particular drug
compatibility. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Elevated blood pressure is one of the most significant risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD); its treatment is a milestone in CKD management. While it is accepted that a stricter blood pressure control is indicated in patients with proteinuria or microalbuminuria, the exact degree of blood pressure reduction to be obtained in CKD patients is still under debate. Following more recent interpretation of old trials, a BP target for <140/90 mmHg is suggested for non-proteinuric CKD patients. In those with microalbuminuria/proteinuria, the ideal blood pressure target should be </=130/80 mmHg. Recently, the SPRINT trial put new emphasis on a stricter blood pressure control, mainly from the cardiovascular point of view. The blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are recommended as first line treatment in all CKD hypertensive patients with micro or macroalbuminuria either diabetics or not. However, their nephroprotective efficacy is less relevant in non-proteinuric patients. The dual RAS blockade was proposed as an additional option. Despite a greater antiproteinuric effect, some large trials in patients at high cardiovascular risk did not demonstrate significant advantage on hard endpoint. Its use is now contraindicated in diabetic CKD patients. Given that RAS blockers can cause acute derangements in kidney function and hyperkalemia, caution is needed with their use, especially in frail and old patients with cardiovascular disease or in the presence of advanced CKD.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The risk of herpes zoster in the dialysis population relative to the general population is not known. The aim of this study was to perform a population-based cohort study to investigate the risk of herpes zoster after the initiation of hemodialysis therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Taiwan, a country with the highest incidence of ESRD in the world. STUDY DESIGN: Matched cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. 843 patients who were beginning hemodialysis therapy in 1999-2003 were included as the study cohort and 3,372 patients without ESRD matched for age and sex were included as a comparison cohort. A multivariate frailty Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to adjust for confounding and compare the 6-year herpes zoster-free survival rate between these 2 cohorts. PREDICTORS: Hemodialysis. OUTCOMES: Herpes zoster. RESULTS: Mean years of follow-up were 4.73 and 5.49 for the hemodialysis and comparison cohorts, respectively. 868 patients developed herpes zoster throughout the study period, 294 from the hemodialysis cohort and 574 from the comparison cohort. The incidence rate of herpes zoster (73.34 events/1,000 person-year) was significantly higher in the hemodialysis cohort than in the control cohort (31.03 events/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for potential confounders, the adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.72-2.27). LIMITATIONS: We expect that some patients with mild zoster chose not to seek medical help. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients treated with long-term hemodialysis are at an increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population.

Journal of Advanced Nursing 68(6), 1716-1725. Abstract Aim. This paper is a report of a study conducted to explore how the family members of older people who will undergo haemodialysis treatment for the rest of their lives perceive participation. Background. The rights of families to participate in treatment and health care are supported by international law, and by national law in Norway since 1999. Method. This study, which employed an explorative qualitative approach, was carried out in Norway in 2008. Data were derived from transcribed interviews with seven family members underwent critical discourse analysis. Findings. Three discourse practices about the next of kin perception of participation were found: (1) to care and take control, (2) to struggle for involvement, and (3) to be forgotten and powerless. The next of kin said that they had no dialogue with the healthcare team, and some fought to be included in the decision-making process. Conclusion. The dominant part of the discourse as expressed by the next of kin seems to be a paternalistic ideology. Thus, finding ways to enable the next of kin to participate in the decision-making process seems to be a major challenge for the healthcare team in the dialysis units.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients
N2  - This study examines the association between cystatin C (cysC) levels and
risks of progression of frailty status or death in older men.
Prospective study of 2,613 men without overt frailty aged 67 years and
older enrolled in the MrOS ancillary sleep study. Baseline measurements
included serum cysC, serum creatinine, and frailty status. Repeat
frailty status, performed an average of 3.4 years later, was assessed as
an ordinal outcome of robust, intermediate stage (prefrail), frail or
dead.
Mean age was 75.7 years. Men with higher cysC were older and had a
higher comorbidity burden. After adjusting for age, clinical site, and
race, higher cysC was associated with nearly twofold greater odds of
being classified as intermediate stage versus robust (OR quartile 4 vs
1; 1.82, 95% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.35-2.45), a threefold greater
odds of frailty versus robust (OR quartile 4 vs 1; 3.13, 95% CI
2.03-4.82), and a more than fivefold greater odds of death versus robust
(OR quartile 4 vs 1; 5.48, 95% CI 2.98-10.08). Results were similar for
cysC-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). This
relationship was attenuated but persisted after adjusting for additional
potential confounders including baseline frailty status, body mass
index, smoking status, comorbidity burden, self-reported disability, and
serum albumin. In contrast, neither serum creatinine nor
creatinine-based eGFR was associated in a graded manner with higher
risks of development of frailty or death.
In this cohort of older men without overt frailty, higher cysC and
cysC-based eGFR, but not creatinine or creatinine-based estimates of
GFR, were associated with increased risks of frailty or death. These
findings suggest that higher cysC level may be a promising biomarker for
unsuccessful aging as manifested by increased risks of frailty and
death.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Frailty is a powerful predictor of outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Sarcopenia as assessed by psoas muscle area (PMA) is a validated tool to assess frailty before surgical procedures. We evaluated PMA as a predictor of outcomes after TAVI in 152 consecutive patients who underwent this procedure at our institution from 2011 to 2014. Preoperative computed tomography scans were used to measure PMA, which then was indexed to body surface area. Outcomes evaluated included (1) early poor outcome (30 days mortality, stroke, dialysis, and prolonged ventilation), (2) 1-year mortality, and (3) high-resource utilization (length of stay >7 days, discharge to rehabilitation, or readmission within 30 days). Indexed PMA (odds ratio [OR] 3.19, confidence interval [CI] 1.30 to 7.83; p = 0.012) and age (OR 1.92, CI 1.87 to 1.98; p = 0.012) predicted early poor outcome. Society of Thoracic Surgeons score predicted 1-year mortality (hazard ratio 3.07, CI 1.93 to 6.23; p = 0.011). High-resource utilization was observed more frequently in patients with PMA less than the median (73% vs 51%, OR 2.65, CI 1.32 to 5.36; p = 0.006). In conclusion, indexed PMA predicts early poor outcome and high-resource utilization after TAVI.

N1  - did not measure frailty in CKD patients

N2  - BACKGROUND: Most studies and national programs aggregate the different types of surgical site infections (SSIs) potentially masking and misattributing risk. Determining that risk factors for superficial, deep, and organ space SSIs are unique is essential to improve SSI rates. METHODS: This cohort study utilized data of 59,365 patients who underwent colon resection at hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2007 to 2009. Four independent, multivariable, predictive models were developed to assess the unique associations between risk factors and each SSI group: Superficial, deep, organ space, and an aggregate of all 3 types of SSIs. RESULTS: Overall, 13% of colon cases developed SSIs: Superficial (8%), deep (1.4%), and organ space (3.8%). Each model was different. Morbidly obese patients were more likely to develop SSIs than normal weight patients across all models; however, risk factors common to all models (eg, body mass index [BMI], duration of operation, wound class, laparoscopic approach) had very different levels of risk. Unique risks for superficial SSIs include diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dyspnea. Deep SSIs had the greatest magnitude of association with BMI and the greatest incidence of wound disruption (19.8%). Organ space SSIs were often owing to anastomotic leaks and were uniquely associated with disseminated cancer, preoperative dialysis, preoperative radiation treatment, and a bleeding disorder, suggesting a physically frail or compromised patient may put the anastomosis at risk. CONCLUSION: Risk factors for superficial, deep, and organ space SSI differ. More effective prevention strategies may be developed by reporting and examining each type of SSI separately.

N1  - did not measure the effects of frailty in CKD patients

N2  - Treatment with dialysis has benefitted large numbers of patients with advanced kidney disease. It is though highly intrusive and demanding and some elderly, frail patients may tolerate it poorly. Some of these patients who are either approaching 'end-stage' kidney disease or 'failing' despite being on dialysis may choose to pursue supportive or palliative approaches, partially or fully replacing the dialysis option. Here, we describe some of the challenges confronting these patients and present data on the attitudes and perceptions to supportive care and end-of-life care planning of patients on haemodialysis including some whose prognosis was poor. The main focus for these patients appeared to be on holding on to what they had, adapting by living 'from day to day' in the present, and continuing to hope for the best. Advance care planning was seen as potentially useful by patients, once clarity surrounding its purpose had been established.

N1  - did not measure effects of frailty in CKD patients
N2  - Elderly dialysis patients with multiple comorbidities often have poorer
tolerance to hemodialysis treatment than younger patients. Typical
complications, such as intra-dialytic hypotension, cramps, atrial
fibrillation and post-dialysis fatigue contribute to a rapid loss of
independence in this vulnerable patient population. The underlying
etiology is a reduced tolerance to intravascular volume changes during
dialysis, which is caused by impaired cardiovascular hemodynamic
responses in combination with uremic and/or diabetic autonomous
neuropathy. Significant reduction in organ perfusion occurring in the
intestines, liver, kidneys, heart and brain contribute to the
development of inflammation, malnutrition, heart failure, frailty,
depression and dementia. To protect vulnerable elderly dialysis patients
from these fatal complications of intradialytic tissue hypoxia, the
prescription of hemodialysis needs to be individually adjusted in
numerous aspects to the sensitivities of multimorbid elderly patients.

N2  - The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising, particularly among the elderly population. Defining aging as successful or unsuccessful has become clinically relevant in the last 15years, with an increased recognition of the frail phenotype. Frailty has been shown to be associated with CKD and poorer outcomes, such as death or dialysis. It is likely that the mechanisms of disease in CKD such as altered protein metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and anemia accelerate normal aging and lead to worsening frailty in elderly patients with CKD.

支持sarcopenia&amp;acidosis是frailty的原因
N2  - Older people constitute an increasingly greater proportion of patients with advanced CKD, including those patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment. Frailty is a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors that results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and causes vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty is common in elderly CKD patients, and it may be associated with protein-energy wasting (PEW), sarcopenia, dynapenia, and other complications of CKD. Causes of frailty with or without PEW in the elderly with CKD can be classified into three categories: causes primarily caused by aging per se, advanced CKD per se, or a combination of both conditions. Frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients are associated with impaired physical performance, disability, poorer quality of life, and reduced survival. Prevention and treatment of these conditions in the elderly CKD patients often require a multifaceted approach. Here, we examine the causes and consequences of these conditions and examine the interplay between frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients.

N2  - Currently, there are no tools to predict postsurgery outcome after kidney transplantation. This study assesses whether frailty influence 30-day postoperative complications after kidney transplantation. One-hundred and fifty kidney transplantations were prospectively included. Frailty was assessed using a frailty indicator, consisting of 15 questions, covering most domains of functioning. Postoperative complications were measured by the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Using a linear regression model, 30-day postoperative complications and frailty correlation were adjusted for confounders, including sex, age, ASA Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, BMI, smoking, dialysis, duration of dialysis, type of transplantation, and retransplantation. The mean frailty score was 2.07(+/-1.6) and 23 patients were classified as frail (GFI >/=4). frailty (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), In conclusion, frailty and type of transplantation are independent factors associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications.

.

By 3 months post-transplant, cognitive performance improved for both frail (slope =0.22 points per week) and nonfrail (slope =0.14 points per week) recipients. Between 1 and 4 years post-transplant, improvements plateaued among nonfrail recipients (slope =0.005 points per week), whereas cognitive function declined among frail recipients (slope =-0.04 points per week). At 4 years post-transplant, cognitive scores were 5.8 points lower for frail recipients compared with nonfrail recipients.

frailty is associated with medium-term cognitive decline post-transplant.
N2  - BACKGROUND: Restoration of kidney function after kidney transplant generally improves cognitive function. It is unclear whether frail recipients, with higher susceptibility to surgical stressors, achieve such post-transplant cognitive improvements or whether they experience subsequent cognitive decline as they age with a functioning graft. METHODS: In this two-center cohort study, we assessed pretransplant frailty (Fried physical frailty phenotype) and cognitive function (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination) in adult kidney transplant recipients. To investigate potential short- and medium-term effects of frailty on post-transplant cognitive trajectories, we measured cognitive function up to 4 years post-transplant. Using an adjusted mixed effects model with a random slope (time) and intercept (person), we characterized post-transplant cognitive trajectories by pretransplant frailty, accounting for nonlinear trajectories. RESULTS: Of 665 recipients (mean age 52.0 years) followed for a median of 1.5 years, 15.0% were frail. After adjustment, pretransplant cognitive scores were significantly lower among frail patients compared with nonfrail patients (89.0 versus 90.8 points). By 3 months post-transplant, cognitive performance improved for both frail (slope =0.22 points per week) and nonfrail (slope =0.14 points per week) recipients. Between 1 and 4 years post-transplant, improvements plateaued among nonfrail recipients (slope =0.005 points per week), whereas cognitive function declined among frail recipients (slope =-0.04 points per week). At 4 years post-transplant, cognitive scores were 5.8 points lower for frail recipients compared with nonfrail recipients. CONCLUSIONS: On average, both frail and nonfrail recipients experience short-term cognitive improvement post-transplant. However, frailty is associated with medium-term cognitive decline post-transplant. Interventions to prevent cognitive decline among frail recipients should be identified.

occurrence of falls, p=0.047
N2  - Falls and mineral and bones disorders are both implicated in the occurrence of pathological fractures in patients undergoing chronic dialysis. However, data on falls among this population are rare. We carried out a prospective study during four weeks and included 70 patients on chronic hemodialysis with the main objectives being to evaluate the incidence of falls and factors related to it. At the end of the four weeks, 16 patients (22.86%) fell at least once, with a total of 17 falls during 4 weeks, giving an incidence of 3.2 falls per patient/year. The mean age was 40 +/- 16 years. Five patients (31.2%) had a past history of pathological fractures. Ten patients (62.5%) presented intra- and post-dialysis hypotension, six (37.5%) was diagnosed of gait disorders and two (12.5%) had sensory deficit of the lower limbs. Six patients (37.5%) presented frailty. Hypotension (P=0.004), frailty (P=0.047) and sensory deficit (P=0.049) were significantly associated with the occurrence of falls. The incidence of falls is relatively high in our hemodialysis patients and real risk factors exist. Hence, it is important to implement programs for falls prevention to reduce their incidence and impact.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the association between frailty and chronic kidney disease. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection remain elusive.

N2  - Objective

To investigate the clinical implications of frailty in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and chronic peritoneal dialysis.

Design

In this prospective study, all of the participants completed the Short Form of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, Korean version, to determine their frailty phenotype. We also obtained blood chemistry and demographic data at enrollment. Data regarding the history of hospitalization and death were collected during the follow-up period.

Subjects

We recruited 1,658 patients (1,255 maintenance hemodialysis and 403 chronic peritoneal dialysis) from multidialysis units (n = 27). We excluded patients who had been hospitalized in the previous 3 months.

Main Outcome Measures

Hospitalization and survival rate during study period.

Results

The participants' mean age was 55.2 ± 11.9 years old, and 55.2% were male. Among the participants, 34.8% were rated as frail and 45.7% as prefrail. Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant associations of frailty with age, comorbidity, disability, unemployment, higher body mass index, and a lower educational level. During the follow-up period (median 17.1 months), 608 patients (79 not frail, 250 prefrail, and 279 frail) were hospitalized, and 87 patients (10 not frail, 24 prefrail, and 53 frail) died (P < .001). Frailty was associated with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.38-2.36) and mortality (hazard ratio, 2.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-5.02).

Conclusion

The frailty phenotype was common even in, prevalent end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis, and was significantly associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality.

N2  - Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults, affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap with what is considered to be “normal aging,” the presence of a thyroid disorder may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with CKD. If a cause–effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased importance.

Frailty was associated with 1.66-fold increased mortality risk [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.67]. BMI was associated with a decreased mortality risk [25.0-29.9 kg/m2 hazard ratio (HR) 0.53 (95% CI 0.31-0.93); &gt;/=30 kg/m2 HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.19-0.62)]. Frailty was associated with elevated mortality risk among HD patients with general [HR 3.77 (95% CI 1.10-12.92)] and abdominal obesity [HR 2.38 (95% CI 1.17-4.82)]. Frailty was not associated with mortality among HD patients without general or abdominal obesity.
N2  - Background: Frail obese community-dwelling older adults are at increased mortality risk. Among hemodialysis (HD) patients, frailty is common and associated with increased mortality risk; however, in dialysis, obesity is associated with decreased mortality risk. Whether the frail-obese phenotype is associated with increased mortality risk among HD patients remains unclear. Methods: This study included 370 incident HD patients enrolled in the Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End Stage Renal Disease (PACE) study. We measured frailty using the Fried phenotype, general obesity [body mass index (BMI) >/=30 kg/m2] and abdominal obesity [waist:hip ratio (WHR) >/=median WHR] and estimated their associations with mortality. Results: The mean age was 55 years, with 42% female, 73% African American, 57% diabetic and 52% frail. Frail HD patients had higher mean BMI (frail = 30.3 kg/m2, non-frail = 28.3 kg/m2; P = 0.02) and similar WHR (P = 0.8). Twenty-two percent were frail with general obesity and 27% were frail with abdominal obesity. Frailty was associated with 1.66-fold increased mortality risk [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.67]. BMI was associated with a decreased mortality risk [25.0-29.9 kg/m2 hazard ratio (HR) 0.53 (95% CI 0.31-0.93); >/=30 kg/m2 HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.19-0.62)]. Frailty was associated with elevated mortality risk among HD patients with general [HR 3.77 (95% CI 1.10-12.92)] and abdominal obesity [HR 2.38 (95% CI 1.17-4.82)]. Frailty was not associated with mortality among HD patients without general or abdominal obesity. Conclusions: In adults initiating HD, frailty was associated with elevated mortality risk, even among the obese. Frail-obese HD patients may be a high-risk, often-overlooked population, as obesity is assumed to be protective. Measurement of frailty and obesity may facilitate risk stratification.
