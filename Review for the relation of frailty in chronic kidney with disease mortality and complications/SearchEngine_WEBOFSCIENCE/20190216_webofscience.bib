Abstract = {{BackgroundWe retrospectively assessed the initial clinical role of
   preoperative frailty in surgical patients with Stanford type A acute
   aortic dissection (AAAD).MethodsOne hundred and fourteen consecutive
   patients who underwent emergent or urgent surgical interventions for
   AAAD in our institute between April 2000 and March 2016 participated in
   this retrospective study. Patients with more than three of the following
   six modalities were defined as being frail: age older than 75years,
   preoperative requirement of assistance in daily living, body mass index
   less than 18.5kg/m(2), female, history of major stroke, and chronic
   kidney disease greater than class 3b. Twenty-three patients (20.2\%)
   were diagnosed with frailty (group F), while 91 patients (79.8\%) were
   not (group N). Early clinical outcomes, major postoperative
   complications, postoperative recovery of activity, and early or mid-term
   survival were evaluated.ResultsAlthough early clinical outcomes and the
   prevalence of major postoperative complications were similar in both
   groups, postoperative activity of daily living (ADL), such as the rate
   of being ambulatory on discharge (p<0.05) and home discharge (p<0.01),
   was significantly lower in group F than in group N. A Kaplan-Meier
   analysis revealed that 1- and 5-year survival rates were similar in
   groups F (85.9 and 76.4\%, respectively) and N (86.0 and 76.9\%,
   respectively).ConclusionsPreoperative frailty in AAAD surgical patients
   has potential as a prognostic factor that affects delays in ADL
   recovery, but does not influence the early or mid-term clinical outcomes
   of prompt surgical strategies for life rescue in AAAD patients with
   frailty.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced age is one of the major determinants of frailty in patients
   with cancer-associated thrombosis. However, multiple other factors
   contribute to frailty in these patients. The identification of frailty
   in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis is critical as it
   influences the complexity of the anticoagulant treatment in this
   population at high risk of venous thromboembolism and bleeding. Factors
   that contribute to frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis
   include age, type of cancer, comorbidities such as chronic kidney
   disease, poly-pharmacotherapy, treatment compliance, cognitive
   impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mobility, nutritional status,
   Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade, risk of falls, and reduced
   life expectancy. In the absence of specific clinical studies current
   anticoagulant treatment guidelines for the management are not fully
   applicable to frail patients with cancer. The anticoagulant treatment
   should therefore benefit from a tailored approach based on an algorithm
   that takes into account the specificities of the malignant disease.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to analyze the impact of frailty, multimorbidity and
   disability on the survival of elderly people attended in a geriatric
   outpatient facility, and identify the clinical risk factors associated
   with death. It is a longitudinal study, with 133 elderly people
   initially evaluated in relation to frailty, multimorbidity (simultaneous
   presence of three or more chronic diseases) and disability in Daily Life
   Activities. The Kaplan Meier method was used to analyze survival time,
   and the Cox regression was used for association of the clinical factors
   with death. In follow-up over six years, 21.2\% of the participants
   died, survival being lowest among those who were fragile (p < 0.05). The
   variables frailty (HR = 2.26; CI95\%: 1.03-4.93) and Chronic Renal
   Insufficiency (HR = 3.00; CI95\%: 1.20-7.47) were the factors of highest
   risk for death in the multivariate analysis. Frailty had a negative
   effect on the survival of these patients, but no statistically
   significant association was found in relation to multimorbidity or
   disability. Tracking of vulnerabilities in the outpatient geriatric
   service is important, due to the significant number of elderly people
   with geriatric syndromes that use this type of service, and the taking
   of decisions on directions for care of these individuals.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Prehabilitation is the process of enhancing preoperative functional
   capacity to improve tolerance for the upcoming stressor; it was
   associated with improved postoperative outcomes in a handful of studies,
   but never evaluated in transplantation. Kidney transplant (KT)
   candidates may be uniquely suited for prehabilitation because they
   experience a profound loss of functional capacity while waiting years on
   dialysis. To better understand the feasibility and effectiveness of
   prehabilitation in KT, we conducted a pilot study of center-based
   prehabilitation for candidates; this intervention consisted of weekly
   physical therapy sessions at an outpatient center with at-home
   exercises. We enrolled 24 participants; 18 participated in
   prehabilitation (75\% of enrolled; 17\% of eligible). 61\% were male,
   72\% were African American, and mean age = 52 (SD = 12.9); 71\% of
   participants had lower-extremity impairment, and 31\% were frail. By 2
   months of prehabilitation, participants improved their physical activity
   by 64\% (P = 0.004) based on accelerometry. Participants reported high
   satisfaction. Among 5 prehabilitation participants who received KT
   during the study, length of stay was shorter than for age-, sex-, and
   race-matched control (5 vs 10 days; RR = 0.69; 95\% CI:0.50-0.94; P =
   0.02). These pilot study findings suggest that prehabilitation is
   feasible in pretransplant patients and may potentially be a strategy to
   improve post-KT outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Aim A recent, growing concern regarding haemodialysis in Japan is a
   sustained increase in the elderly population. Among very elderly people
   who start haemodialysis, the prognosis is considered to be poor;
   however, this has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to
   discover the short-term prognosis and related factors in very elderly
   patients who commence haemodialysis. Methods Between January 2008 and
   December 2013, 122 patients aged >= 85 years at haemodialysis initiation
   were documented in our hospital. Predictors of 90-day and 1-year
   mortality after haemodialysis initiation were assessed with Cox
   proportional hazards regression analysis. Selection of covariates for
   the multivariate model was based on forward stepwise selection using the
   probability of a likelihood ratio statistics. Results The subjects' mean
   age was 87.4 +/- 2.5 years, and 48\% were female. The most common cause
   of death was infection (38\% of patients) and the leading cause of
   infectious death was pneumonia. The 90-day and 1-year survival rates
   were 81\% and 62\%, respectively. Suboptimal initiation was a
   significant prognostic factor for 90-day {[}hazard ratio (HR) 3.98, 95\%

   analysis. Conclusion Very elderly patients who started haemodialysis had
   a poor prognosis, and suboptimal initiation significantly predicted
   outcome. Shared decision-making with patients and their families is
   needed for initiating haemodialysis on the conditions that appropriate
   information on the expected prognosis is provided.}},

   15 questions, covering most domains of functioning. Postoperative
   complications were measured by the Comprehensive Complication Index
   (CCI). Using a linear regression model, 30-day postoperative
   complications and frailty correlation were adjusted for confounders,
   including sex, age, ASA Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension,
   BMI, smoking, dialysis, duration of dialysis, type of transplantation,

Abstract = {{PurposeHyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common abnormality in patients
   with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Since the introduction of
   cinacalcet in 2004, a shift from surgery toward predominantly medical
   treatment has occurred. Surgery is thought to be associated with more
   complications than oral medication. The aim of this retrospective study
   was to evaluate 30-day outcomes and effectiveness of parathyroidectomy
   (PTx) in ESRD patients in the Netherlands.MethodsA national database
   containing data from four academic medical centers in the Netherlands of
   patients with ESRD-related HPT, who had undergone PTx and kidney
   transplantation between 1994 and 2015, was established. Primary
   endpoints were 30-day mortality and complication rate. Secondary
   endpoints were biochemical measurements.ResultsWe identified 187 HPT
   patients undergoing PTx, with a median age of 46years. Median
   preoperative PTH level was 866pg/mL (interquartile range {[}IQR]
   407-1547pg/mL). At 3months, the median PTH drop from baseline was 93\%
   (IQR, 71-98\%) to a median of 61pg/mL (IQR, 23-148pg/mL, p<0.001). Over
   the 25-year inclusion period, 13 patients (7.0\%) required
   re-exploration for persistent or recurrent disease. Thirty-day mortality
   and complication rate were 0.0\% and 7.9\% respectively. Median serum
   calcium levels improved significantly postoperatively from 2.6 (2.4-2.8)
   mmol/L to 2.3 (2.1-2.5) mmol/L (p<0.001).ConclusionsPTx is a safe and
   effective procedure in the frail ESRD population. These data show that
   there should be no reluctance for surgical intervention and when
   indicated, nephrologists can safely refer these patients for PTx.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has
   been diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk
   factor for frailty, but it still remains unknown whether diabetic
   nephropathy is associated with frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The
   authors carried out the present study to reveal the association between
   frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients.
   Methods A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited.
   Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who
   suffered diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n
   = 150) or not (Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the
   difference of the prevalence of frailty between the two groups.

   The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than
   that in the Non-DN group (28.0\% vs 16.5\%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the
   association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail

Abstract = {{Background. Frailty assessment is recommended to evaluate the candidacy
   of adults referred for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Psoas
   muscle area (PMA) is an easily measured biomarker for frailty. There has
   yet to be a study examining the prognostic impact of PMA in OHT
   patients. Methods. In this retrospective study, preoperative and
   postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were retrieved for adults
   transplanted between 2000 and 2015 at a tertiary care hospital.
   Psoasmuscle area was measured on a single axial image. Outcomes of
   interest were all-cause mortality over 6 years and a composite of
   in-hospital mortality or major morbidity (prolonged ventilation, stroke,
   dialysis, mediastinitis, or reoperation). Results. Of 161 adult patients
   transplanted, 82 had at least 1 abdominal CT scan. At baseline, mean PMA
   was 25.7 +/- 5.8 cm(2) in men and 16.0 +/- 3.6 cm(2) in women, and
   decreased by 8\% from the first to the last available CT scan. Adjusting
   for age, sex, body mass index, and cardiomyopathy etiology, every
   1-cm(2) increase in PMA was found to be associated with a 9\% reduction
   in long-term mortality (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95\% confidence interval

   mortality or major morbidity (odds ratio, 0.83; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.96; P =

   mortality or major morbidity increased fourfold (odds ratio, 4.29; 95\%
   CI, 1.19-15.46; P = 0.026). Conclusions. Muscle mass is an independent

Abstract = {{Background: It is known that sarcopenia is related to
   malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis (MM) syndrome and is an
   important problem in dialysis patients. The notion of frailty includes
   various physical, psychological, and social aspects. Although it has
   been reported that sarcopenia is associated with poor prognosis in
   patients with hemodialysis, reports on peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients
   are rare. In this study, we examined the morbidity and mortality of
   sarcopenia and frailty in PD patients. We also investigated the
   MM-related factors.
   Methods: We evaluated 119 patients cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
   The Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria and the Clinical Frailty
   Scale (CFS) were used to diagnose sarcopenia and frailty. The primary
   outcome is all-cause mortality with sarcopenia and frailty. The
   secondary outcome is the relationship between various MIA-related
   factors.
   Results: Morbidity of sarcopenia and frailty in PD patients was 8.4\%
   and 10.9\%, respectively. Old age, high values of Barthel Index,
   Charlson Comorbidity Index, CFS, and low values of body mass index
   (BMI), muscle strength, muscle mass, and slow walking were associated
   with sarcopenia. Interleu kin-6, albumin, and prealbu min were
   significantly-correlated with muscle mass. During follow-up, the
   presence of sarcopenia or frailty was associated with the risk of
   mortality. In multivariate analysis, CFS was related to the mortality
   rate of PD patients.
   Conclusions: The presence of sarcopenia or frailty was associated with a
   worse prognosis.}},

   (http://genomics.senescence.info/genes including GenAge, AnAge,
   LongevityMap, CellAge, DrugAge, Digital Aging Atlas) to identify genes
   regulated in aging, longevity, and age-related diseases with a focus on
   secreted factors or molecules detectable in body fluids as potential
   frailty biomarkers. Factors broadly expressed, related to several
   ``hallmark of aging{''} pathways as well as used or predicted as
   biomarkers in other disease settings, particularly age-related
   pathologies, were identified. This set of biomarkers was further
   expanded according to the expertise and experience of the authors. In
   the next step, biomarkers were assigned to six ``hallmark of aging{''}
   pathways, namely (1) inflammation, (2) mitochondria and apoptosis, (3)
   calcium homeostasis, (4) fibrosis, (5) NMJ (neuromuscular junction) and
   neurons, (6) cytoskeleton and hormones, or (7) other principles and an
   extensive literature search was performed for each candidate to explore
   their potential and priority as frailty biomarkers.
   Results: A total of 44 markers were evaluated in the seven categories
   listed above, and 19 were awarded a high priority score, 22 identified
   as medium priority and three were low priority. In each category high
   and medium priority markers were identified.
   Conclusion: Biomarker panels for frailty would be of high value and
   better than single markers. Based on our search we would propose a core
   panel of frailty biomarkers consisting of (1) CXCL10 (C-X-C motif
   chemokine ligand 10), IL-6 (interleukin 6), CX3CL1 (C-X3-C motif
   chemokine ligand 1), (2) GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15), FNDC5
   (fibronectin type III domain containing 5), vimentin (VIM), (3)
   regucalcin (RGN/SMP30), calreticulin, (4) PLAU (plasminogen activator,
   urokinase), AGT (angiotensinogen), (5) BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic
   factor), progranulin (PGRN), (6) alpha-klotho (KL), FGF23 (fibroblast
   growth factor 23), FGF21, leptin (LEP), (7) miRNA (micro Ribonucleic
   acid) panel (to be further defined), AHCY (adenosylhomocysteinase) and
   KRT18 (keratin 18). An expanded panel would also include (1) pentraxin
   (PTX3), sVCAM/ICAM (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule
   1/Intercellular adhesion molecule 1), defensin alpha, (2) APP (amyloid
   beta precursor protein), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), (3) S100B (S100
   calcium binding protein B), (4) TGF beta (transforming growth factor
   beta), PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1), TGM2 (transglutaminase
   2), (5) sRAGE (soluble receptor for advanced glycosylation end
   products), HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1), C3/C1Q (complement factor
   3/1Q), ST2 (Interleukin 1 receptor like 1), agrin (AGRN), (6) IGF-1
   (insulin-like growth factor 1), resistin (REIN), adiponectin (ADIPOQ),
   ghrelin (GHRL), growth hormone (GH), (7) microparticle panel (to be
   further defined), GpnmB (glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B)
   and lactoferrin (LTF). We believe that these predicted panels need to be
   experimentally explored in animal models and frail cohorts in order to
   ascertain their diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential.}},

Abstract = {{Context. It has become commonplace to use family caregivers as proxy
   responders where patients are unable to provide information about their
   symptoms and concerns to health care providers.
   Objectives. The objective of this study was to determine the degree of
   concordance between patients' and family members' reports of patient
   symptoms and concerns at end of life.
   Methods. Sample dyads included a mix of patients residing at home, in a
   nursing home, in a long-term care facility, or in hospice. Diagnoses
   included patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 75), chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 52), end-stage renal disease (n =
   42), and institutionalized, cognitively intact frail elderly (n = 49).
   Dyads completed the Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI), the modified
   Structured Interview Assessment of Symptoms and Concerns in Palliative
   Care, and Graham and Longman's two-item Quality of Life Scale.
   Results. Concordance was less than 70\% for seven of the 25 PDI items,
   with the lowest concordance (65.1\%) for the item `` not being able to
   continue with my usual routines.'' For all but one PDI item, discordance
   was in the direction of family members reporting that the patient was
   worse off than the patient had indicated. Where discordance was observed
   on the Structured Interview Assessment of Symptoms and Concerns in
   Palliative Care and Quality of Life Scales, the trend toward family
   members overreporting patient distress and poor quality of life
   continued.
   Conclusion. Understanding discordance between patients and family member
   reports of symptoms and concerns is a valuable step toward minimizing
   patient and family burden at end of life. (C) 2018 American Academy of

Abstract = {{Under normal conditions, inflammation is a protective and physiological
   response to various harmful stimuli. However, in several chronic
   debilitating disorders, such as chronic kidney disease, inflammation
   becomes maladaptive, uncontrolled and persistent. Systemic persistent
   inflammation has, for almost 20 years, been recognized as a major
   contributor to the uraemic phenotype (such as cardiovascular disease,
   protein energy wasting, depression, osteoporosis and frailty), and a
   predictor of cardiovascular and total mortality. Since inflammation is
   mechanistically related to several ageing processes (inflammageing), it
   may be a major driver of a progeric phenotype in the uraemic milieu.
   Inflammation is likely the consequence of a multifactorial aetiology and
   interacts with a number of factors that emerge when uraemic toxins
   accumulate. Beside interventions aiming to decrease the production of
   inflammatory molecules in the uraemic milieu, novel strategies to
   increase the removal of large middle molecules, such as expanded
   haemodialysis, may be an opportunity to decrease the inflammatory
   allostatic load associated with retention of middle molecular weight
   uraemic toxins.}},

Abstract = {{Depressive symptoms and frailty are each independently associated with
   morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. We
   hypothesized that having both depressive symptoms and frailty would be
   synergistic and worse than the independent effect of each. In a
   multicenter cohort study of 773 KT recipients, we measured the Fried
   frailty phenotype and the modified 18-question Center for Epidemiologic
   Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Using adjusted Poisson regression and
   survival analysis, we tested whether depressive symptoms (CES-D
   score>14) and frailty were associated with KT length of stay (LOS),
   death-censored graft failure(DCGF), andmortality. AtKTadmission, 10.0\%
   of patients exhibited depressive symptoms, 16.3\% were frail, and 3.6\%
   had both. Recipients with depressive symptoms were more likely to be
   frail(aOR=3.97, 95\% CI: 2.28-6.91, P<0.001).Recipients with both
   depressive symptoms and frailty had a 1.88 times (95\% CI: 1.70-2.08,

   mortality, compared to those who were nonfrail and without depressive
   symptoms. There was only evidence of synergistic effect of frailty and
   depressive symptoms on length of stay (P for interaction<0.001).
   Interventions aimed at reducing pre-KT depressive symptoms and frailty

Title = {{Why are hospitalisations too long? A simple checklist for identifying
   the main social barriers to hospital discharge from a nephrology ward}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{The present increase in life span has been accompanied by an even higher
   increase in the burden of comorbidity. The challenges to healthcare
   systems are enormous and performance measures have been introduced to
   make the provision of healthcare more cost-efficient. Performance of
   hospitalisation is basically defined by the relationship between
   hospital stay, use of hospital resources, and main diagnosis/diagnoses
   and complication(s), adjusted for case mix. These factors, combined in
   different indexes, are compared with the performance of similar
   hospitals in the same and other countries. The reasons why an approach
   like this is being employed are clear.
   Cutting costs cannot be the only criteria, in particular in elderly,
   high-comorbidity patients: in this population, although social issues
   are important determinants of hospital stay, they are rarely taken into
   account or quantified in evaluations. Quantifying the impact of the
   ``social barriers{''} to care can serve as a marker of the overall
   quality of treatment a network provides, and point to specific
   out-of-hospital needs, necessary to improve in-hospital performance. We
   therefore propose a simple, empiric medico-social checklist that can be
   used in nephrology wards to assess the presence of social barriers to
   hospital discharge and quantify their weight.
   Using the checklist should allow: identifying patients with social
   frailty that could complicate hospitalisation and/or discharge;
   evaluating the social needs of patient and entourage at the beginning of
   hospitalisation, adopting timely procedures, within the partnership with
   out-of-hospital teams; facilitating prioritization of interventions by
   social workers.
   The following ten items were empirically identified: reason for
   hospitalisation; hospitalisation in relation to the caregiver's
   problems; recurrent unplanned hospitalisations or early
   re-hospitalisation; social/family isolation; presence of a dependent
   relative in the patient's household; lack of housing or unsuitable
   housing/accommodation; loss of autonomy; lack of economic resources;
   lack of a safe environment; evidence of physical or psychological abuse.
   The simple tool here described needs validation; the present proposal is
   aimed at raising attention on the importance of non-medical issues in
   medical organisation in our specialty, and is open to discussion, to
   allow its refinement.}},

Abstract = {{Pain is one of the most common symptoms among patients with end-stage
   renal disease (ESRD), and is often under recognized and not adequately
   managed in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Barriers to adequate pain
   management include poor awareness of the problem, insufficient medical
   education, fears of possible drug-related side effects, and common
   misconceptions about the inevitability of pain in elderly and HD
   patients. Caregivers working in HD should be aware of the possible
   consequences of inadequate pain assessment and management. Common pain
   syndromes in HD patients include musculoskeletal diseases and metabolic
   neuropathies, associated with typical intradialytic pain. Evaluating the
   etiology, nature, and intensity of pain is crucial for choosing the
   correct analgesic. A mechanism-based approach to pain management may
   result in a better outcome. Pharmacokinetic considerations on clearance
   alterations and possible toxicity in patients with ESRD should drive the
   right analgesic prescription. Comorbidities and polymedications may
   increase the risk of drug-drug interactions, therefore drug metabolism
   should be taken into account when selecting analgesic drugs.
   Automedication is common among HD patients but should be avoided to
   reduce the risk of hazardous drug administration. Further research is
   warranted to define the efficacy and safety of analgesic drugs and
   techniques in the context of patients with ESRD as generalizing
   information from studies conducted in the general population could be
   inappropriate and potentially dangerous. A multidisciplinary approach is
   recommended for the management of complex pain syndromes in frail
   patients, such as those suffering from ESRD.}},

Abstract = {{Frail patients are known to experience poor outcomes. Nevertheless, we
   know less about how frailty manifests itself in patients' physiology
   during critical illness and how it affects resource use in intensive
   care units (ICU). We aimed to assess the association of frailty with
   short-term outcomes and organ support used by critically ill patients.
   Retrospective analysis of prospective collected data from 93 ICUs in
   Brazil from 2014 to 2015. We assessed frailty using the modified frailty
   index (MFI). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary
   outcomes were discharge home without need for nursing care, ICU and
   hospital length of stay (LOS), and utilization of ICU organ support and
   transfusion. We used mixed logistic regression and competing risk models
   accounting for relevant confounders in outcome analyses.
   The analysis consisted of 129,680 eligible patients. There were 40,779
   (31.4\%) non-frail (MFI = 0), 64,407 (49.7\%) pre-frail (MFI = 1-2) and
   24,494 (18.9\%) frail (MFI >= 3) patients. After adjusted analysis,
   frailty was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (OR 2.42, 95\%
   CI 1.89-3.08), particularly in patients admitted with lower SOFA scores.
   Frail patients were less likely to be discharged home (OR 0.36, 95\% CI
   0.54-0.79) and had higher hospital and ICU LOS than non-frail patients.
   Use of all forms of organ support (mechanical ventilation, non-invasive
   ventilation, vasopressors, dialysis and transfusions) were more common
   in frail patients and increased as MFI increased.
   Frailty, as assessed by MFI, was associated with several
   patient-centered endpoints including not only survival, but also ICU LOS
   and organ support.}},

Abstract = {{Following a total hip arthroplasty (THA), early hospital re-admission
   rates of 3-11\% are considered as `acceptable' in terms of medical care
   cost policies. Surprisingly, the impact of re-admissions on mortality
   has not been priorly portrayed. Therefore, we sought to determine the
   mortality rate after 90-day re-admissions following a THA in a series of
   patients from a captive medical care program.
   We prospectively analysed 90-day readmissions of 815 unilateral,
   elective THA patients operated upon between 2010 and 2014 whose medical
   care was the one offered by our institution. We stratified our sample
   into readmitted and non-readmitted cohorts. Through a Cox proportional
   hazards model, we compared demographic characteristics, clinical
   comorbidities, surgical outcomes and laboratory values between both
   groups in order to determine association with early and late mortality.
   We found 37 (4.53\%) re-admissions at a median time of 40.44 days (IQR
   17.46-60.69). Factors associated with re-admission were hospital stay (p
   = 0.00); surgical time (p = 0.01); chronic renal insufficiency (p =
   0.03); ASA class 4 (p = 0.00); morbid obesity (p = 0.006); diabetes (p =
   0.04) and a high Charlson index (p = 0.00). Overall mortality rate of
   the series was 3.31\% (27/815). Median time to mortality was 455.5 days
   (IQR 297.58-1170.65). One-third (11/37) of the re-admitted patients
   died, being sepsis non-related to the THA the most common cause of
   death. After adjusting for confounders, 90-day re-admissions remained
   associated with mortality with an adjusted HR of 3.14 (CI95\% 1.05-9.36,
   p = 0.04).
   Unplanned re-admissions were an independent risk factor for future
   mortality, increasing three times the risk of mortality.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{The initiation of dialysis is often not reasonable in very old patients
   with high comorbidities. This is especially true for patients who are
   geriatrically described as frail and show cognitive and executive
   function deficits. For estimation of the impairments, scores and
   standardized tests are more suitable than clinical experience or the
   surprise question. During the clarification for geriatric patients about
   the imminent need for dialysis, in addition to the options of various
   dialysis procedures the option of conservative treatment should also be
   discussed. In no way should all geriatric patients be given false hopes
   and the prospect that after beginning dialysis the health-related
   problems will be drastically improved. This is only the case with very
   few patients. Often only a stabilization of the condition can be
   achieved. In the case of conservative treatment an intensive orientation
   to the symptoms is more important than treatment to avoid delayed
   sequelae of dialysis. Inclusion in the palliative medicine network seems
   to be advisable. Initiation of dialysis treatment should be carried out
   by onset of uremia or other complications. A premature initiation of
   dialysis treatment is not meaningful in geriatric patients; however,
   there seems to be no doubt that dialysis in relatively healthy geriatric
   patients increases the survival rate. Focusing on symptom control and
   quality of life should be given priority in geriatric patients. A
   rehabilitation treatment before or after starting dialysis can possibly
   contribute to stabilization.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The combined effects of reduced functional mobility, muscle
   weakness, and low serum albumin on mortality in hemodialysis patients
   have not been clarified. Here, we examined the associations of reduced
   functional mobility, muscle weakness, and low serum albumin-both alone
   and in combination-with all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients.
   Methods: A total of 490 patients treated between July 2010 and October
   2016 were enrolled retrospectively in this study. The independent
   prognostic effect of the combination of reduced functional mobility,
   muscle weakness, and low serum albumin on survival was estimated by Cox
   proportional hazard regression analysis. We calculated the increases in
   predictive capacity by combining the associations of reduced functional
   mobility, muscle weakness, and low serum albumin in comparison to each
   component alone based on the receiver-operating characteristic curves,
   continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated
   discrimination improvement (IDI).
   Results: The final study population consisted of 314 hemodialysis
   patients, and 56 patients died during the 6.5-year follow-up period. The
   high Combined score group showed a significantly lower cumulative
   survival rate than the low Combined score group (hazard ratio, 3.30;
   95\% confidence interval, 1.59-6.87; P = .001). Both NRI and IDI
   suggested that the addition of Combined score to patient characteristics
   improved discrimination of patients at high risk of mortality (NRI,
   0.038 95\% CI: 0.096 - 0.064, P < .001 IDI, 0.029 95\% CI: 0.004 -
   0.055, P = .025).
   Conclusions: The combined assessment of reduced functional mobility,
   muscle weakness, and low serum albumin was associated with poorer
   prognosis in patients on hemodialysis. The results presented here

Title = {{Frailty Intervention Trial iN End-Stage patientS on haemodialysis
   (FITNESS): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frailty is a state of low physiological reserve and
   multi-systemic dysregulation that leads to susceptibility to external
   stressors; it is associated with adverse outcomes. North American data
   suggest that haemodialysis recipients are more likely to be frail than
   the general population, although data on UK cohorts are lacking.
   Furthermore, with a multitude of assessment tools, it is difficult for
   the clinician to ascertain which is most suitable for this population.
   The FITNESS Study aims to measure the prevalence and outcomes associated
   with frailty in a large UK haemodialysis cohort to determine the optimum
   frailty tool as defined by predictive value for
   mortality/hospitalisation and to conduct a feasibility study exploring a
   multi-disciplinary clinical intervention to improve frailty among
   haemodialysis recipients.
   Methods/design: The study will follow a cohort multiple randomised
   controlled trial design; the initial cohort study will identify
   participants to be invited into a subsequent open-label randomised
   controlled trial. Eligible patients will be identified and recruited
   from their usual haemodialysis session. They will be invited to complete
   tasks and questionnaires collecting data on sarcopenia,
   immunosenescence, mood, cognition, disability, and comorbidity. Fifty
   pre-frail participants with suitable English proficiency will be
   randomly selected from this cohort to participate in the randomised
   controlled trial phase of the study. Further stratified randomisation
   will occur to assign these 50 participants to active or passive groups.
   The active group will receive a psychologically supported,
   patient-centred, multi-disciplinary intervention into frailty, in what
   we believe to be a first within this patient group. The control group
   will receive usual haemodialysis standard of care. All participants will
   be followed up using electronic patient records for outcomes to include
   hospitalisation and mortality. Primary outcomes for this phase of the
   study will be feasibility and tolerability of the clinical intervention
   study.
   Discussion: The study will collect data on multiple aspects of frailty
   allowing for a rich dataset for detailed analysis. We believe this will
   be the first study to explore a psychologically supported,
   patient-centred intervention in this patient group.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive and renal impairment are pervasive among elderly frails, a
   high-risk, geriatric sub-population with peculiar clinical
   characteristics. In a series of frail individuals with non-advanced
   chronic kidney disease (CKD), we aimed at assessing the entity of
   functional, general health and cognitive impairment and the possible
   relationship between these types of dysfunction and the severity of
   renal impairment.
   2229 geriatric subjects were screened for frailty and CKD. Severity of
   CKD was assessed by eGFR (CKD-EPI formula). Frailty was established by
   the Fried Index. Functional, general health and cognitive status were
   assessed by validated score measures.
   Final analysis included 271 frail CKD subjects (162 women, 109 men).
   Mean eGFR was 64.25 +/- 25.04 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Prevalence of
   mild-to-moderate CKD (stage 3-4) was 44\%. Twenty-six percent of
   patients had severe cognitive impairment, while mild and moderate
   impairment was found in 7 and 67\% of individuals, respectively. All
   subjects had poor functional and general health status. Cognitive
   capacities significantly decreased across CKD stages (p for trend <
   0.0001). In fully adjusted multivariate analyses, cognitive status
   remained an independent predictor of eGFR (beta = 0.465; p < 0.0001).
   Mild-to-moderate CKD is highly pervasive among frail elderly individuals
   and the severity of renal dysfunction is independently correlated with
   that of cognitive impairment. Future studies are advocated to clarify
   whether the combination of kidney and mental dysfunction may portend a
   higher risk of worsen outcomes in this high-risk population.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence
   of diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people
   with diabetes, about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now
   older than 65 years. Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is
   associated with cognitive impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people
   with diabetes have significantly more comorbidities, such as myocardial
   infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and renal impairment,
   compared with those without diabetes. However, as a consequence of the
   increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a considerable
   number of older individuals can now survive for many years without any
   vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals
   with type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which
   must take into account the health status, presence or absence of
   complications, and life expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of
   otherwise healthy older individuals and overtreatment of those who are
   frail may be avoided. Specifically, overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in
   older patients is potentially harmful; in particular, insulin and
   sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used with caution.
   Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia are
   preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney
   function are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.}},

   over 60 years of age were randomly allocated into 2 groups:
   tacrolimus-sirolimus (21 patients) and tacrolimus-mycophenolate (23

Abstract = {{Background Frail kidney transplant (KT) recipients may be particularly
   vulnerable to surgical stressors, resulting in delirium and subsequent
   adverse outcomes. We sought to identify the incidence, risk factors, and
   sequelae of post-KT delirium.
   Methods We studied 125,304 adult KT recipients (1999-2014) to estimate
   delirium incidence in national registry claims. Additionally, we used a
   validated chart abstraction algorithm to identify post-KT delirium in
   893 adult recipients (2009-2017) from a cohort study of frailty.
   Delirium sequelae were identified using adjusted logistic regression
   (length of stay >= 2 weeks and institutional discharge {[}skilled
   nursing or rehabilitation facility]) and adjusted Cox regression
   (death-censored graft loss and mortality).
   Results Only 0.8\% of KT recipients had a delirium claim. In the cohort
   study, delirium incidence increased with age (18-49 years old: 2.0\%;
   50-64 years old: 4.6\%; 65-75 years old: 9.2\%; and >= 75 years old:
   13.8\%) and frailty (9.0\% versus 3.9\%); 20.0\% of frail recipients
   aged >= 75 years old experienced delirium. Frailty was independently
   associated with delirium (odds ratio {[}OR], 2.05; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}95\% CI], 1.02 to 4.13; P=0.04), but premorbid global
   cognitive function was not. Recipients with delirium had increased risks
   of >= 2-week length of stay (OR, 5.42; 95\% CI, 2.76 to 10.66; P<0.001),

Abstract = {{Objectives: Acute kidney injury frequently complicates critical illness
   and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Frailty is common
   in critical illness survivors, but little is known about the impact of
   acute kidney injury. We examined the association of acute kidney injury
   and frailty within a year of hospital discharge in survivors of critical
   illness.
   Design: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Medical/surgical ICU of a U.S. tertiary care medical center.
   Patients: Three hundred seventeen participants with respiratory failure
   and/or shock.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: Acute kidney injury was determined using
   Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stages. Clinical frailty status
   was determined using the Clinical Frailty Scale at 3 and 12 months
   following discharge. Covariates included mean ICU Sequential Organ
   Failure Assessment score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
   Evaluation II score as well as baseline comorbidity (i.e., Charlson
   Comorbidity Index), kidney function, and Clinical Frailty Scale score.
   Of 317 patients, 243 (77\%) had acute kidney injury and one in four
   patients with acute kidney injury was frail at baseline. In adjusted
   models, acute kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 were associated with
   higher frailty scores at 3 months (odds ratio, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.14-3.24;
   odds ratio, 2.40; 95\% CI, 1.31-4.42; and odds ratio, 4.41; 95\% CI,
   2.20-8.82, respectively). At 12 months, a similar association of acute
   kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 and higher Clinical Frailty Scale score
   was noted (odds ratio, 1.87; 95\% CI, 1.11-3.14; odds ratio, 1.81; 95\%
   CI, 0.94-3.48; and odds ratio, 2.76; 95\% CI, 1.34-5.66, respectively).
   In supplemental and sensitivity analyses, analogous patterns of
   association were observed.
   Conclusions: Acute kidney injury in survivors of critical illness
   predicted worse frailty status 3 and 12 months postdischarge. These
   findings have important implications on clinical decision making among
   acute kidney injury survivors and underscore the need to understand the
   drivers of frailty to improve patient-centered outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Elderly patients comprise the fastest growing population
   initiating dialysis in United States. The impact of poor functional
   status and pre-dialysis health status on clinical outcomes in elderly
   dialysis patients is not well studied.
   Methods: We studied a retrospective cohort of 49,645 incident end stage
   renal disease patients that initiated dialysis between January 1, 2008
   and December 31, 2008 from the United States Renal Data System with
   linked Medicare data covering at least 2 years prior to dialysis
   initiation. Using logistic regression models adjusted for pre-dialysis
   health status and other cofounders, we examined the impact of poor
   functional status as defined from form 2728 on 1-year all-cause
   mortality as primary outcome, type of dialysis modality (hemodialysis
   vs. peritoneal dialysis), and type of initial vascular access
   (arteriovenous access vs. central venous catheter) among hemodialysis
   patients as secondary outcomes.
   Results: Mean age was 72 +/- 11 years. At dialysis initiation, 18.7\%
   reported poor functional status, 88.9\% had at least 1 pre-dialysis
   hospitalization, and 27.8\% did not receive pre-dialysis nephrology
   care. In adjusted analyses, 1-year mortality was higher in patients with
   poor functional status (OR, 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.40-1.57). Adjusted odds of
   being initiated on hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis (odds ratio
   {[}OR], 1.39; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.16-1.66) were higher in
   patients with poor functional status. Poor functional status decreased
   the adjusted odds of starting hemodialysis with arteriovenous access as
   compared to central venous catheter (OR, 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.72-0.86).
   Conclusion: Poor functional status in elderly patients with end stage
   renal disease is associated with higher odds of initiating hemodialysis;
   increases the risk of central venous catheter use, and is an independent
   predictor of 1-year mortality.}},

   significant enrichment of gene expression of brain-related transcripts.
   Further, we observed inverse genetic correlations of grip strength with

   performance scores. By use of Mendelian randomization, we provide
   evidence that higher grip strength is protective of both coronary heart

Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Importance
   Patients on dialysis are often elderly and frail, with multiple comorbid
   conditions, and are heavy users of Emergency Department (ED) services.
   However, objective data on the frequency and pattern of ED utilization
   by dialysis patients are sparse. Such data could identify periods of
   highest risk for ED visits and inform health systems interventions to
   mitigate these risks and improve outcomes
   Objective
   To describe the pattern and frequency of presentation to ER by dialysis
   patients
   Design
   Retrospective cohort study using administrative data collected over ten
   years (2000-2009) in the Province of Manitoba, Canada.
   Setting
   Patients presenting to any of 9 ED's in Winnipeg and Brandon Manitoba.
   These departments serve >90\% of the population of Manitoba, Canada
   (population 1.2 million).
   Participants
   All patients presenting to an ED in any of 9 emergency departments in
   Manitoba, Canada.
   Exposure
   Dialysis status
   Main outcomes
   Presentation to the ED
   Results
   Over 2.1 million ED visits by more than 1.2 million non-dialysis
   patients and 17,782 ED visits by 3257 dialysis patients were included.
   Dialysis patients presented 8.5 times more frequently to the ED than the
   general population (age and sex adjusted, p<0.001). For dialysis
   patients, ED utilization was significantly higher following the long
   interdialytic interval (33.6\% higher Mondays and 19.5\% higher Tuesdays
   vs. other days of the week, p<0.001) and was 10-fold higher in the 7
   days before and after the initiation of dialysis.
   Conclusion and relevance
   The heavy use of ED services by dialysis patients spikes upward
   following the long interdialytic interval and also in the week before
   and after dialysis initiation. The relative risks associated with these
   vulnerable periods were much higher than those reported for clinical
   patient characteristics. We propose that intrinsic gaps in the structure
   of care delivery (e.g. 3 times a week dialysis, imperfect surveillance
   and clinical monitoring of patients with low GFR) may be the fundamental
   drivers of this periodicity. Strategies to mitigate this excess health
   risk are needed.}},

Title = {{Bacterial pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients}},
Journal = {{RESPIRATORY MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{89-94}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after
   transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher
   risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens
   during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae,
   Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.), but gram-positive coccus
   such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic
   bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be
   guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial
   resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation,
   pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia,
   H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens
   take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually
   highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this
   period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a
   chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low
   intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia
   caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in
   diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in
   kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently
   coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect
   prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality.
   This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial
   pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella,
   Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus.
   Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression
   will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy
   and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy
   should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study evaluated the impact of body mass index (BMI) and
   patient functional status on the risk for surgical complications after
   kidney transplant.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study of adult kidney transplant
   recipients grouped patients by baseline Karnofsky status (low function
   <= 70\%) and further stratified by morbid obesity (BMI >= 35 kg/m(2)) to
   assess surgical complication risk.
   Results: 736 patients were included with surgical complications
   occurring in 25\%. Logistic regression analysis with interaction terms
   demonstrated that morbid obesity and low functional status conditionally
   impact risk with an OR of 2.8 {[} 95\% CI (1.1-7.3)]. Within the
   functional status cohort, BMI >= 35 kg/m(2) was associated with
   increased risk of surgical complication, superficial wound infection,
   and DGF. Independent predictors for surgical complications included
   diabetes and morbid obesity with low functional status. There was no
   significant difference in graft loss or death across the cohorts.
   Conclusions: While neither morbid obesity nor poor functional status
   alone predicts increased complications, the combined presence is
   associated with significant increase in risk for surgical complications
   after renal transplantation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
   consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has
   been associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive
   findings are available nowadays in patients suffering from
   hypoglycaemia. We investigated whether SUA levels at the time of
   hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality after 1-year follow-up.
   In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
   Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled
   between January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the
   study consisted in determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED
   admission could predict the occurrence of death after 1 year.
   The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
   chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value
   obtained by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a
   Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43
   mg/dL were more prone to death after 1 year compared to those with lower
   SUA levels. The risk of death increased with high SUA levels both in the
   univariate and the multivariate models including estimated glomerular
   filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and age-adjusted
   Charlson comorbidity index.
   SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in hypoglycaemic
   patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing the
   risk of death in these frail patients.}},

Abstract = {{It is often of interest to compare centers or healthcare providers on
   quality of care delivered. We consider the setting where evaluation of
   center performance on multiple competing events is of interest. We
   propose estimating center effects through cause-specific proportional
   hazards frailty models that allow correlation among a center's
   cause-specific effects. Estimation of our model proceeds via penalized
   partial likelihood and is implemented in R. To evaluate center
   performance, we also propose a directly standardized excess cumulative
   incidence (ECI) measure. Therefore, based on our proposed methods,
   practitioners can evaluate centers either through the cause-specific
   hazards or the cumulative incidence functions. We demonstrate, through
   simulations, the advantages of the proposed methods to detect outlying
   centers, by comparing the proposed methods and existing methods which
   assume uncorrelated random center effects. In addition, we develop a
   Correlation Score Test to test the null hypothesis that the competing
   event processes within a center are correlated. Using data from the
   Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we apply our method to
   evaluate the performance of Organ Procurement Organizations on two

Abstract = {{The prevalence of end-stage renal disease is rising in the United
   States, which bears high financial and public health burden. The most
   common modality of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the United States
   is in-center hemodialysis. Many patients report lack of comprehensive
   and timely education about their treatment options, which may preclude
   them from participating in home-based dialysis therapies and kidney
   transplantation evaluation. While RRT education has traditionally been
   provided in-person, the rise of telehealth has afforded new
   opportunities to improve upon the status quo. For example,
   technology-augmented RRT education has recently been implemented into
   telehealth nephrology clinics, informational websites and mobile
   applications maintained by professional organizations, patient-driven
   forums on social media, and multimodality programs. The benefits of
   technology in RRT education are increased access for geographically
   isolated and/or medically frail patients, versatility of content
   delivery, information repetition to enhance knowledge retention, and
   interpersonal connection for educational content and emotional support.
   Challenges center around privacy and accuracy of information sharing, in
   addition to differential access to technology due to age and
   socioeconomic status. A review of available scholarly and social media
   resources suggests that technology-aided delivery of education about
   treatment options for end-stage renal disease provides an important
   alternative and/or supplemental resource for patients and families.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Frailty among the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population
   is highly prevalent and has been associated with mortality. Little is
   known about the relation of different aspects of body composition, a
   modifiable risk factor, with the risk of frailty in ESRD population.
   Design and methods: One hundred and fifty-one patients including 85 men
   and 66 women, aged >= 18 years with ESRD who had been receiving
   conventional maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for at least 3 months were
   included. Body fat and muscle mass from both bio-impedance spectroscopy
   and skin-fold thickness and waist circumference as a surrogate of
   abdominal obesity were measured. Frailty was defined based on Fried's
   criteria. Health-related quality of life was collected using the RAND
   version of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36) Survey.
   Results: We performed single and multiple predictor logistic regression
   analyses to determine factors associated with frailty. After adjustment
   for age, sex, and comorbidities, fat mass (both by bio-impedance
   spectroscopy and anthropometry) and waist circumference, but not muscle
   mass remained the main predictors of frailty. The odds ratio of frailty
   in the third tertile compared with the first was 4.97 (1.70-14.55) and
   3.84 (1.39-10.61) for fat mass and waist circumference, respectively (P
   for trends for both <.05). The scores of physical health and kidney
   disease effect component of quality of life were lower in frail compared
   with nonfrail patients (40.7 +/- 9.2 vs. 33.7 +/- 10.2, P < .01 and 66.8
   +/- 22.4 vs. 51.6 +/- 25.7, P < .05 for physical health and effects of
   disease, respectively).
   Conclusions: Frailty, which is associated with poor outcomes in chronic
   HD patients, is common and predicted by fat mass and waist circumference
   but not by body mass index and muscle mass. Interventions to modify
   abdominal obesity, reflected by waist circumference, could potentially
   lower the incidence of frailty and hence improve the quality of life in
   the HD population. (C) 2017 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. All

Abstract = {{Type 2 diabetes prevalence is high in older adults and is expected to
   rise in the next decades. Diabetes in the population of frail older
   adults is accompanied by functional disability, several comorbidities,
   and premature mortality. A comprehensive geriatric assessment, including
   functional, cognitive, mental and social status, is advisable for
   identifying the glycemic targets and glucose-lowering therapies, focused
   on patient preferences, needs, and risks. The therapeutic options for
   older adults with diabetes are like those for the adult population.
   However, the pharmacological treatments must be carefully prescribed and
   monitored, taking into consideration the patient cognitive capacities,
   the potentially life-threatening drug-drug interactions, the
   cardiovascular risk, and with the main goal of avoiding hypoglycemia.
   Also, a careful nutritional evaluation with appropriate tools, as well
   as a balanced and periodically monitored physical activity, contribute
   to an effective tailored care plan, as needed by older adults with
   diabetes. This review evaluates the currently available hypoglycemic
   drugs and the current indications to the Italian diabetology community,

   older with diabetes, including the unmet needs by the guidelines. (C)

Abstract = {{Background. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reflects a patient's
   disease burden, treatment effectiveness, and health status and is
   summarized by physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific scales among
   end-stage renal disease patients. Although on average HRQOL improves
   postkidney transplant (KT), the degree of change depends on the ability
   of the patient to withstand the stressor of dialysis versus the ability
   to tolerate the intense physiologic changes of KT. Frail KT recipients
   may be extra vulnerable to either of these stressors, thus affecting
   change in HRQOL after KT. Methods. We ascertained frailty, as well as
   physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific HRQOL in a multicenter
   prospective cohort of 443 KTrecipients (May 2014 to May 2017) using
   Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short Form. We quantified the
   short-term (3 months) rate of post-KT HRQOL change by frailty status

   HRQOL scores at KTwere 43.3 (SD, 9.6) for physical, 52.8 (SD, 8.9) for

Abstract = {{Background: Although individuals classified as nonresident aliens,
   including undocumented immigrants, are entitled to receive emergency
   dialysis in the United States regardless of their ability to pay, most
   states do not provide them with subsidized care for maintenance dialysis
   or kidney transplantation. We explored whether nonresident aliens have
   similar outcomes to US citizens after receiving kidney transplants
   covered by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program.
   Study Design: Retrospective observational cohort study.
   Setting \& Participants: All adult Medicaid patients in the US Renal
   Data System who received their first kidney transplant from 1990 to
   2011. Predictor: Citizenship status, categorized as US citizen,
   nonresident alien, or permanent resident.
   Outcome: All-cause transplant loss.
   Measurements: HRs and 95\% CIs estimated by applying Cox proportional
   hazards frailty models with transplantation center as a random effect.
   Results: Of 10,495 patients, 8,660 (82\%) were US citizens, 1,489 (14\%)
   were permanent residents, and 346 (3\%) were nonresident aliens, whom we
   assumed were undocumented immigrants. Nonresident aliens were younger,
   healthier, receiving dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a
   living donor. 71\% underwent transplantation in California, and 61\%
   underwent transplantation after 2005. Nonresident aliens had a lower
   unadjusted risk for transplant loss compared with US citizens (HR, 0.48;
   95\% CI, 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still significant when
   adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, dialysis, and
   transplant-related factors (HR, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.46-0.94).
   Limitations: Citizenship status was self-reported, possible residual
   confounding.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that the select group of insured
   nonresident aliens who undergo transplantation with Medicaid do just as
   well as US citizens with Medicaid. Policymakers should consider
   expanding coverage for kidney transplantation in nonresident aliens,
   including undocumented immigrants, given the associated high-quality
   outcomes in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Fried frailty phenotype, a measure of physiologic
   reserve defined by 5 components (exhaustion, unintentional weight loss,
   low physical activity, slow walking speed, and poor grip strength), is
   associated with poor outcomes among ESRD patients. However, these 5
   components may not fully capture physiologic reserve in this population.
   We aimed to ascertain opinions of ESRD clinicians and patients about the
   usefulness of the Fried frailty phenotype and interventions to improve
   frailty in ESRD patients, and to identify novel components to further
   characterize frailty in ESRD.
   Methods: Clinicians who treat adults with ESRD completed a 2-round
   Delphi study (n = 41 and n = 36, respectively; response rate = 87\%).
   ESRD patients completed a survey at transplant evaluation (n = 460;
   response rate = 81\%). We compared clinician and patient opinions on the
   constituent components of frailty.
   Results: Clinicians were more likely than patients to say that ESRD
   makes patients frail (97.6\% vs. 60.2\%). There was consensus among
   clinicians that exhaustion, low physical activity, slow walking speed,
   and poor grip strength characterize frailty in ESRD patients; however,
   29\% of clinicians thought weight loss was not relevant. Patients were
   less likely than clinicians to say that the 5 Fried frailty components
   were relevant. Clinicians identified 10 new ESRD-specific potential
   components including falls (64\%), physical decline (61\%), and
   cognitive impairment (39\%). Clinicians (83\%) and patients (80\%)
   agreed that intradialytic foot-peddlers might make ESRD patients less
   frail.
   Conclusions: There was consensus among clinicians and moderate consensus
   among patients that frailty is more common in ESRD. Weight loss was not
   seen as relevant, but new components were identified. These findings are
   first steps in refining the frailty phenotype and identifying
   interventions to improve physiologic reserve specific to ESRD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The mean age of people undergoing dialysis therapy has been
   on the rise because of improved survival in this patient population, as
   well as the reduced availability of transplants for elderly patients.
   Aging in Japanese dialysis patients is more rapid than those in the
   United States and Europe. Frailty is generally considered as an
   age-related fragile state, and a condition in which the individual is in
   a vulnerable state at increased risk of adverse health outcomes and/or
   dying when exposed to a stressor. This review focuses on the
   underscoring the importance of identifying physical frailty in
   hemodialysis patients and proposes an algorithm integrating frailty
   assessment into the routine care of patients treated with dialysis.
   Summary: Physical frailty is highly prevalent in patients undergoing
   hemodialysis, and can potentially be prevented or treated with
   management of physical frailty. The management of physical frailty
   consists of identifying physical inactivity and poor physical
   performance and the individualized prescription of exercise. While
   expert clinical guidelines focus on management of patients in the
   outpatient dialysis care setting, it is not included in routine clinical
   care of dialysis facilities. Little is known about the management of
   frailty in the hemodialysis population and its effects on health
   outcomes. Further research is needed to define optimal strategies for
   screening and treatment of frailty in this vulnerable population. Key
   Messages: Management of physical frailty, which is composed of
   identification of poor physical performance and physical inactivity and
   exercise intervention, as usual care in patients undergoing hemodialysis
   may improve their quality of life and prognosis. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {{As the aging of the population progresses in Japan, the nutritional
   problems in dialysis patients are being high-lighted. Frailty is a
   clinical concept including body weight loss, muscle weakness,
   fatigability, decreased walking speed, and decreased physical activity,
   which means an intermediate concept between healthy subjects and
   disability subjects, indicating that their activities of daily living
   are not decreased but they cannot smoothly perform housework or
   exercise. Morbidity of dialysis patients is known to be high, and
   mortality of dialysis patients with frailty is 3 times higher.
   Sarcopenia is one of the principal reasons for or triggers of frailty.
   It is a disease setting showing decreased muscle volume and quality
   associated with decreased physical function or quality of life. Recent
   mean age at dialysis therapy induction is getting near to 70 years old
   in Japan. Japanese dialysis patients who are elderly and present organ
   failure would have a double risk for sarcopenia. Patients with advanced
   stages of CKD are generally given protein diet, and it has been reported
   that a low protein intake in dialysis patients would be a significant
   risk for developing sarcopenia and increasing mortality. Recently, the
   focus has been on protein energy wasting (PEW) - an underlying disease
   condition in sarcopenia or frailty. PEW is an energy wasting condition
   occurring in dialysis patients, and the cause of PEW is principally
   decreased food intake and increased catabolism. It has recently been
   revealed that decreased protein intake would be a risk factor for
   increased mortality in dialysis patients. The incidence of PEW in
   dialysis patients is reported to be 14\%. To avoid sarcopenia and PEW
   leading to frailty, we should pay much more attention to an appropriate
   protein and calorie intake rather than restriction in dialysis patients.

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Several clinical practice guidelines recommend regular
   assessment of physical activity and physical function as part of routine
   care in hemodialysis patients. However, there is no clear evidence to
   support these recommendations. We investigated whether the proportion of
   attendance at a regular program for management of physical activity and
   physical function can predict all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
   events in hemodialysis patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort
   study consisted of 266 hemodialysis patients participating in the
   management program at least once. Participants were tracked for 3 years
   after their first attendance at the management program to determine
   their attendance proportion. The main study outcomes included all-cause
   mortality and a composite of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events.
   Results: Median patient age was 64.5 (interquartile range, 56.8 72.0)
   years, 45\% were women, and the median time on hemodialysis was 35.5
   (interquartile range, 12.0 114.3) months at baseline. Sixty-five
   patients died over a median follow-up of 79 months. The incidence of
   cardiovascular events was 60 over a median follow-up of 68 months. Even
   after adjusting for any of the prognostic models, participants who
   attended <= 75\% of sessions (n = 140) had higher risks of mortality
   (hazard ratio (HR), 1.79; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.00 3.36; P =

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Frailty and depression both contribute to malnutrition
   and adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
   However, their interaction is incompletely defined. Methods: We studied
   178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed by a
   validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by
   the Geriatric Depression Scale; nutritional status was determined by
   subjective global assessment (SGA) and malnutrition inflammation score
   (MIS). All patients were followed for up to 24 months for survival and
   hospitalization analysis. Results: There were 111 patients (62.4\%)
   physically frail, amongst those 48 (43.2\%) had depressive symptoms.
   Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without frailty. There was an
   additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty on
   nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty, frail but no
   depressive symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin
   decreased in a stepwise manner (35.8 +/- 5.6, 34.9 +/- 4.4, and 32.9 +/-
   5.3 g/L, respectively, p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 +/- 0.61,

Abstract = {{The relationship between frailty and chronic kidney disease in elderly
   population has been recognized; however, studies concentrating on
   frailty in predialysis patients are limited. For nephrologists, the
   recognition of frailty is important as it has impact on decisions on the
   choice of dialysis modality and sometimes on whether dialysis is indeed
   in the patients' best interests. Many of the tools for routine
   assessment of frailty are not easily applicable to those clinicians not
   practicing elderly care medicine. A tool needs to be simple and
   applicable for daily routine practice. The aim of this study was to
   assess the prevalence and clinical outcome of frailty in an elderly
   predialysis population using simple tools. A nonrandomized prospective
   study was conducted in which, 104 patients aged 65 years or above with
   an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25 mL or less were included.
   Data including age, sex, renal function, calcium, albumin, parathormone,
   and comorbidities were collected at baseline and at three months
   interval for one year. Functional performance was assessed using
   Karnofsky scale. The Charlson comorbidity index was used to assess
   comorbid status of each patient. Frailty was assessed using a
   combination of PRISMA questionnaire and Timed up and Go test. End points
   were death or start of dialysis at 20-month follow-up. A frail group (n
   = 58; males = 32, females = 26) and a nonfrail group (n = 46; males =
   21, females = 25) were identified. Frailty was prevalent in 53.8\% of
   the selected population. There was no significant difference between
   both groups in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, hemoglobin,
   inflammatory markers, or calcium hemostasis. Nine patients chose
   conservative management in the frail group and six in nonfrail group.
   Rate of death was significantly higher in the frail group (death = 14)
   compared to nonfrail group (death = 3; P = 0.01). There was no
   significant difference between both groups in terms of initiation of
   dialysis (P = 0.1). Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index were
   significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.023 and 0.032,
   respectively). Survival in frail patients who started peritoneal
   dialysis (PD) was slightly better than those started on hemodialysis
   (HD) with hazard ratio = 3.23 (P = 0.23). Our study shows that the
   prevalence of frailty and mortality rate is high among elderly
   predialysis patients. Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index are
   independent predictors of outcome in this population. PD might be a
   better option of dialysis modality compared to HD in the frail
   population.}},

Title = {{The Association of Vitamin D Levels and the Frailty Phenotype Among
   Non-geriatric Dialysis Patients: A Cross-sectional Study}},
Journal = {{CLINICS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{73}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of
   frailty and the association of vitamin D levels and the frailty
   phenotype among non-geriatric dialysis patients.
   METHOD: Seventy-four stable, chronic hemodialysis patients from the
   hemodialysis unit of the hospital were enrolled in the study. The
   patients' medical histories and laboratory findings were obtained from
   the medical records of the dialysis unit. Serum parathyroid hormone and
   25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were determined using chemiluminometric
   immunoassays. Frailty was defined by Fried et al. as a phenotype;
   shrinking, weakness, self-reported exhaustion, decreased activity and
   slowed walking speed were evaluated.
   RESULTS: Forty-one (55\%) of the patients were males. The patients were
   divided into 3 groups according to frailty scores: 39 (53\%) patients
   were frail, 6 (8\%) patients were intermediately frail, and 28 (39\%)
   patients were normal. Significant differences were found for 25-hydroxy
   vitamin D and hemoglobin levels among the groups; however, no
   differences were observed in body mass index, comorbidities, sex,
   marital status, education, disease and dialysis durations, or
   parathyroid hormone, creatinine, serum calcium, phosphorus, and
   potassium levels.
   CONCLUSIONS: Weakness and slowness are serious outcomes of both vitamin
   D deficiency and frailty, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated
   with increased risks of decreased physical activity, falls, fractures
   and death in postmenopausal women and older men. Although studies on
   frailty have focused on older adults, growing evidence indicates that
   the frailty phenotype is becoming a factor associated with poor health
   outcomes in non-geriatric populations with chronic disease.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Greater physical activity is associated with lower risk of
   mortality in persons with kidney disease; however, little is known about
   the appropriate dose of physical activity among hemodialysis patients.
   Here detected the minimum level of habitual physical activity to help
   inform interventions aimed at improving outcomes in the dialysis
   population.
   Design: The design was prospective cohort study.
   Subjects: Clinically stable outpatients in a hemodialysis unit from
   October 2002 to March 2014 were assessed for their eligibility to be
   included in this 7-year prospective cohort study. We used the Youden
   index to determine the optimal cutoff points for physical activity. The
   prognostic effect of physical activity on survival was estimated by Cox
   proportional hazards regression analysis. The number of steps per
   nondialysis day was recorded by accelerometer at study entry.
   Main Outcome Measure: The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality.
   Results: There were 282 participants who had a mean age of 65 +/- 11
   years and 45\% were female. A total of 56 deaths occurred during the
   follow-up period (56 months {[}interquartile range: 29-84 months]). The
   cutoff value for the physical activity discriminating those at high risk
   of mortality was 3,752 steps. After adjustment for the effect of
   confounders, the hazard ratio in the group of <4,000 steps was 2.37
   (95\% confidence interval: 1.22-4.60, P = .01) compared with the others.
   Conclusions: Engaging in physical activity is associated with decreased
   mortality risk among hemodialysis patients. Our findings of a
   substantial mortality benefit among those who engage in at least 4,000

   A large retrospective cohort study}},
Journal = {{MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In patients with lymphoma, an important issue that has been recognized
   is renal involvement, including glomerulonephritis, acute kidney injury,
   and lymphoma infiltrating the kidney. However, the prevalence and
   mortality of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not been fully understood
   in lymphoma patients. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of CKD
   and its impact on mortality in those patients.
   This was a retrospective cohort study of 429 consecutive lymphoma
   patients who were admitted or regularly visited our hospital from
   January 2013 to October 2016. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular
   filtration rate (eGFR) < 60mL/min/1.73m(2) and/or proteinuria >= 1+ that
   was sustained for at least 3 months. The prevalence of CKD at enrollment
   was evaluated according to the modified CKD classification by Kidney
   Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) (eGFR and proteinuria
   category). Dipstick proteinuria was classified into 3 grades: A1 for -
   and +/-; A2 for 1+ or 2+; and A3 for >= 3+. The eGFR (mL/min/1.73m(2))
   was classified into 6 stages: G1 for >= 90, G2 for 60 to 89, G3a for 45
   to 59, G3b for 30 to 44, G4 for 15 to 29, and G5 for <15. The cumulative
   mortality rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with
   stratification into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of CKD.
   Furthermore, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model
   was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) for all-cause mortality, after adjustments for age, sex,
   pathologic type, clinical stage of lymphoma, presence or absence of
   diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.
   The mean follow-up period was 3.06 +/- 0.96 years, and the prevalence of
   CKD at study enrollment was 34.5\%. The cumulative mortality rate was
   20.7\%, and was significantly higher in the CKD group than in the group
   without CKD (36.4\% vs 18.0\%, P = .02). Multivariate analysis found
   mortality to be significantly associated with CKD (HR 1.58; 95\% CI,
   1.01-2.46), and this association was the most robust with very high-risk
   CKD (HR 6.94; 95\% CI, 2.50-17.33).
   The prevalence of CKD in lymphoma patients was high. CKD should be
   considered an independent risk factor for mortality among patients with
   lymphoma.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis are
   typically characterized by multimorbidity and increasingly by advanced
   age; however, there are few data on their geriatric needs.
   The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of a
   large cohort of incident patients in ambulatory hemodialysis units with
   a particular focus on those aged over 80 years in Germany.
   The electronic patient registry of the Board of Trustees (Kuratorium)
   for Dialysis and Kidney Transplantation (KfH) was searched for all
   patients who began hemodialysis in 1 of the 191 units between 2007 and
   2013 and were 65 years and older. Patients were analyzed by age (65-79
   years and >= 80 years) for clinical and biochemical characteristics,
   mortality, quality of life and hospitalizations.
   Of the 21,355 incident patients, a total of 13,872 (65\%) were over 65
   years old, with 9998 (46.8\%) aged between 65 and 79 years and 3874
   (18.1\%) patients 80 years or older (oldest old). The spectrum of
   morbidity was comparable between the two age groups but there was a
   significantly higher prevalence of anemia, hypoalbuminemia and
   multimorbidity (> four comorbidities) in the older age group. Median
   survival was 4.5 years (1638 days) in the younger age group and 2.7
   years (978 days) in the older group. Almost half of the patients
   experienced at least one episode of hospitalization during the first
   year but there were no significant differences between the age groups
   (45.9\% in younger vs. 47\% in older patients). In the older age group
   463 (12\%) patients survived more than 5 years after initiation of
   hemodialysis despite the presence of multiple risk factors for adverse
   clinical outcome.
   More than half of the chronic ambulatory hemodialysis patients were of
   advanced age and had a very high burden of multimorbidity. Nevertheless,
   a subgroup of ERSD patients over 80 years old survived at least 5 years
   on hemodialysis despite the presence of multiple risk factors for
   adverse clinical outcome. Identification of these patients as well as
   optimized care for frail hemodialysis patients will require application
   of geriatric assessment tools in addition to traditional parameters in
   nephrology. The development and validation of such tools should be the
   subject of further clinical studies.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo determine the association between frequency of leaving the
   house and mortality.
   DesignProspective follow-up of an age-homogenous, representative,
   community-dwelling birth cohort (born 1920-21) from the Jerusalem
   Longitudinal Study (1990-2015).
   SettingHome.
   ParticipantsIndividuals aged 70 (n=593), 78 (n=973), 85 (n=1164), and 90
   (n=645), examined in 1990, 1998, 2005, and 2010, respectively.
   MeasurementsFrequency of leaving the house, defined as daily (6-7/week),
   often (2-5/week), and rarely (1/week); geriatric assessment; all-cause
   mortality (2010-15). Kaplan-Meier survival charts and proportional
   hazards models adjusted for social (sex, marital status, financial
   status, loneliness), functional (sex, self-rated health, fatigue,
   depression, physical activity, activity of daily living difficulty), and
   medical (sex, chronic pain, visual impairment, hearing impairment,
   diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney
   disease) covariates.
   ResultsAt ages 70, 78, 85, and 90, frequency of going out daily was
   87.0\%, 80.6\%, 65.6\%, and 48.4\%; often was 6.4\%, 9.5\%, 17.4\%, and
   11.3\%; and rarely was 6.6\%, 10.0\%, 17.0\%, and 40.3\% respectively.
   Decreasing frequency of going out was associated with negative social,
   functional, and medical characteristics. Survival rates were lowest
   among those leaving rarely and highest among those going out daily
   throughout follow-up. Similarly, compared with rarely leaving the house,
   unadjusted mortality hazard ratios (HRs) were lowest among subjects
   leaving daily and remained significant after adjustment for social,
   functional and medical covariates. Among subjects leaving often,
   unadjusted HRs showed a similar effect of smaller magnitude, with
   attenuation of significance after adjustment in certain models. Findings
   were unchanged after excluding subjects dying within 6months of
   follow-up.
   ConclusionIn community-dwelling elderly adults aged 70 to 90, leaving
   the house daily was associated with lower mortality risk, independent of
   social, functional, or medical status.}},

Title = {{Optimizing the Management of Uncontrolled Hypertension: What do Triple
   Fixed-Dose Drug Combinations Add?}},
Journal = {{CURRENT VASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{61-65}},
Abstract = {{Fixed-dose triple drug combinations represent one of the latest
   innovations of pharmacotherapy for hypertension (HT). They combine a
   traditional renin-angiotensin system blocker, a diuretic and a calcium
   channel blocker. The main benefit is the simplification of treatment
   regimen because 3 different agents are combined at different doses in a
   single pill. Improving adherence to treatment partly explains why this
   kind of combination may effectively reduce blood pressure (BP). BP
   lowering by a single- pill triple-drug combination can be approximately
   predicted, by using appropriate formulas described in previous
   meta-analysis of randomized trials. Thus, clinicians may select the
   appropriate dose for each of the combined drugs. Selection of different
   types of fixed-dose triple-drug combinations relies upon clinical
   experience, commercial availability and evidence from clinical trials
   and meta-analyses for each agent alone. However, triple fixed-dose drug
   combinations should be reserved only for patients with uncontrolled BP
   with 2 agents, poor adherence in complex therapeutic regimens or on
   inappropriate free-drug combinations. Also, triple therapy may help
   overcome clinical inertia by prescribing more potent antihypertensive
   formulations in one pill.
   In contrast, this type of multiple-drug fixed-dose combination might be
   less safe in very old and frail patients, as well as in those with
   chronic kidney disease. Although new combinations may help overcome the
   clinical inertia of achieving individualized BP targets, doctors should
   also pay attention reinforcement of lifestyle changes.}},

   with increasing age in a major metropolitan renal service}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Aim of our study is to describe, in people with CKD, the
   demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes with increasing
   age. The prevalence of CKD in Western populations, where longevity is
   the norm, is about 10-15\%, but how age influence different
   characteristics of patients with CKD is largely not known.
   Methods: One thousand two hundred sixty-five patients enrolled in the
   CKD. QLD registry at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital were
   grouped according to age at consent i.e. <35, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64,
   65-74, 75-84, 85+ years age groups, and were followed till start of
   renal replacement therapy (RRT), death, discharge or the censor date of
   September 2015.
   Results: Age ranged from 17.6 to 98.5 years with medians of 70.1 and
   69.9 years for males and females respectively: 7\% were <35 years of
   age, with the majority (63\%) >65 years old. The leading renal diagnoses
   changed from genetic real disease (GRD) and glomerulonephritis (GN) in
   the younger patients to renovascular disease (RVD) and hypertension
   (HTN) in older patients. With increasing age, there were often multiple
   renal disease diagnoses, more advanced stages of CKD, greater number of
   comorbidities, more frequent and more costly hospitalizations, and
   higher death rates. The rates of initiation of renal replacement therapy
   (RRT) rose from 4.5 per 100 person years in those age <35 years to a
   maximum of 5.5 per 100 person years in 45-54 years age group and were
   lowest, at 0.5 per 100 person years in those >85 years. Mortality rates
   increased by age group from 1.3 to 17.0 per 100 person years in 35-44
   year and 85+ year age groups respectively. Rates of hospitalization,
   length of stay and cost progressively increased from the youngest to
   eldest groups. Patients with diabetic nephropathy had highest incidence
   rate of RRT and death. The proportion of patients who lost more than
   5mls/min/1.73m(2) of eGFR during at least 12 months follow up increased
   from 13.3\% in the youngest age group to 29.2\% in the eldest.
   Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive view, with no exclusions, of
   CKD patients seen in a public renal specialty referral practice, in
   Australia. The age distribution of patients encompasses the whole of
   adult life, with a broader range and higher median value than patients
   receiving RRT. Health status ranged from a single system (renal) disease
   in young adults through, with advancing age, renal impairment as a
   component of, or accompanying multisystem diseases, to demands and
   complexities of support of frail or elderly people approaching end of
   life. This great spectrum demands a broad understanding and capacity of
   renal health care providers, and dictates a need for a wider scope of
   health services provision incorporating multiple models of care.}},

   electroencephalographic findings among end-stage renal disease patients:
   an observational study}},
Journal = {{BMC GERIATRICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frailty is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive
   impairment. However, apart from its influence on cognition, it is
   currently unknown whether frailty affects subtler cerebral function in
   patients with ESRD.
   Methods: Patients with ESRD were prospectively enrolled, with clinical
   features and laboratory data recorded. The severity of frailty among
   these patients with ESRD was ascertained using the previously validated
   simple FRAIL scale, and was categorized as none-to-mild and
   moderate-to-severe frailty. All participants underwent quantitative
   electroencephalography (EEG), with band powers documented following the
   generation of the delta to alpha ratio (DAR) and delta/theta to
   alpha/beta ratio (DTABR). EEG results were then compared between groups
   of different levels of frailty.
   Results: In this cohort, (mean age: 68.9 +/- 10.4 years, 37\% male, 3.4
   +/- 3 years of dialysis), 20, 60, 40, 17, and 6\% patients exhibited
   positivity in the fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and
   loss-of-body-weight domains, respectively, with 45.7\% being none to
   mildly frail and 54.3\% being moderately to severely frail. Those with
   mild frailty had a significantly higher delta power compared to those
   with more severe frailty, involving all topographic sites. Patients with
   ESRD and severe frailty had significantly lower global, left frontal,
   left temporo-occipital, and right temporo-occipital DAR and DTABR,
   except in the right frontal area, and tended to have central
   accentuation of alpha, beta, and theta power, and more homogeneous DTABR
   and DAR distribution compared to the findings in those with mild
   frailty.
   Conclusions: Frailty in patients with ESRD can have subtler
   neurophysiological influences, presenting as altered EEG findings, which
   warrant our attention.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. - Acetate in hemodialysis solutions exerts inflammatory,
   vasodilatatory and cardio-depressive effects. Citrate has been proposed
   as an optimal substitute. The aim of the present trial was the
   comparison of the hemodynamic and biological parameters on a group of
   patients dialysed consecutively with 4 acetate-free haemodialysis
   techniques.
   Methods. - In a prospective crossover manner, we measured the
   hemodynamic and biological effects of four acetate-free hemodialysis
   methods: the acetate-free biofiltration with variable potassium (AFBK)
   and three methods with a citrate buffer: conventional hemodialysis (HD),
   on-line hemodiafiltration (HDF) and on-line hemofiltration (HF).
   Fourteen chronic hemodialysis patients (9 males mean age 72.21 +/- 11.21
   years old) underwent 6 four-hour dialysis sessions for 2 weeks on each
   of the 4 studied techniques.
   Results. - The AFBK technique presented less intradialytic hypotensive
   episodes (1 in 84 sessions) compared to the other techniques (HD: 29/84,
   HDF 22/82 and HF: 14/78; P < 0.001). The blood pressure after one, two,
   three hours of dialysis and at the end of the hemodialysis session was
   significantly higher in the AFBK technique. On AFBK the net
   ultrafiltration (UF) (P < 0.001) and the OF as a percentage of the dry
   weight (P = 0.005) were significantly higher. A significant correlation
   between the prevalence of hypotensive episodes and the change of serum
   potassium levels (P = 0.002) during the first hour of dialysis was
   detected.
   Conclusions. - AFBK is associated with a better intradialytic
   hemodynamic tolerance and could be an optimal method for frail
   hypotension-prone hemodialysis patients. (C) 2017 Societe francophone de

Abstract = {{Objectives The clinical practice guidelines published by the Renal
   Physicians Association (USA) recommend instituting advance care planning
   (ACP) for patients with end-stage renal disease. Studies on this issue
   are lacking in Italy. Our aim was to determine the attitudes of patients
   on ACP in our dialysis centre.
   Methods We performed a cross-sectional survey. We recruited patients on
   maintenance haemodialysis (HD) at Hemodialysis Center of Universita
   Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, from 1 March 2014 to 31 March 2015. The only
   exclusion criterion was inability to give an informed consent. Patients
   completed a questionnaire concerning their treatment preferences in
   three hypothetical disease scenarios: persistent vegetative state,
   advanced dementia, severe terminal illness; for each patients, we also
   collected clinical, functional and socioeconomic data.
   Results Thirty-four HD outpatients completed the study questionnaire.
   The majority of respondents (85\%) considered information about
   prognosis, health conditions and treatment options, including
   withdrawing dialysis, as very important and 94\% of respondents
   considered treatment of uraemic/dialytic symptoms the most important
   issue. In the health scenarios provided, dialysis was the treatment
   least withheld. Dependence on instrumental activities of daily living
   (0.048) and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (p=0.035) were
   associated with continuing dialysis in at least one scenario.
   Conclusions ACP should be tailored to patients' value, culture and
   preferences. A significant proportion of patients, however, do not want
   to be involved in end of life decisions. Frail elderly patients, in
   particular, are not inclined to interrupt dialysis, despite poor quality
   of life or a poor prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Exercise improves physical capacity in patients with
   end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis (HD), but few patients engage
   in it. Whole-body vibration exercise (WBVE) is a novel protocol that has
   been shown to benefit frail elderly patients' rehabilitation. We
   assessed the utility of WBVE before HD sessions and tested methods to
   inform the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
   Methods: Physical condition and quality of life were assessed at
   enrolment and repeated 2 weeks later in a pilot study of 49 patients
   undergoing regular HD. All patients then undertook 8 weeks of WBVE,
   thrice weekly for 3 min, after which the assessments were repeated and
   results compared (paired t- tests). Further assessments were made after
   a 4-week layoff. Patients completed a post-study questionnaire about
   their experiences of using WBVE. The reproducibility of WBVE and effects
   on measures of functionality, muscle strength, indirect exercise
   capacity, nutritional status, bone health and quality of life were
   recorded to undertake a power calculation for an RCT.
   Results: Of 49 patients enrolled, 25 completed all assessments. The
   dropout rate was high at 49\%, but overall, WBVE was an acceptable form
   of exercise. Functionality as assessed by the 60-s sit-to-stand test
   (STS-60) improved significantly by 11\% (P = 0.002). Some quality of
   life domains also improved significantly. All improvements were
   maintained 4 weeks after discontinuing WBVE.
   Conclusions: WBVE was acceptable, safe, easily incorporated into the
   routine of HD and was associated with useful improvements in physical
   function sufficient to justify a RCT.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To test whether frailty, a novel measure of physiologic
   reserve, is associated with longer kidney transplant (KT) length of stay
   (LOS), and modifies the association between LOS and mortality.
   Background: Better understanding of LOS is necessary for informed
   consent and discharge planning. Mortality resulting from longer LOS has
   important regulatory implications for hospital and transplant programs.
   Which recipients are at risk of prolonged LOS and its effect on
   mortality are unclear. Frailty is a novel preoperative predictor of poor
   KT outcomes including delayed graft function, early hospital
   readmission, immunosuppression intolerance, and mortality.
   Methods: We used registry-augmented hybrid methods, a novel approach to
   risk adjustment, to adjust for LOS risk factors from the Scientific
   Registry of Transplant Recipients (n = 74,859) and tested whether (1)
   frailty, measured immediately before KT in a novel cohort (n = 589), was
   associated with LOS (LOS: negative binomial regression; LOS >= 2 weeks:
   logistic regression) and (2) whether frailty modified the association
   between LOS and mortality (interaction term analysis).
   Results: Frailty was independently associated with longer LOS
   {[}relative risk = 1.15, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.29; P =
   0.01] and LOS >= 2 weeks (odds ratio = 1.57, 95\% CI: 1.06-2.33; P =
   0.03) after accounting for registry-based risk factors, including
   delayed graft function. Frailty also attenuated the association between
   LOS and mortality (nonfrail hazard rate = 1.55 95\% CI: 1.30-1.86; P <
   0.001; frail hazard rate = 0.97, 95\% CI: 0.79-1.19, P = 0.80; P for
   interaction = 0.001).
   Conclusions: Frail KT recipients are more likely to experience a longer
   LOS. Longer LOS among nonfrail recipients may be a marker of increased
   mortality risk. Frailty is a measure of physiologic reserve that may be
   an important clinical marker of longer surgical LOS.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study determined whether frailty provides incremental
   value to the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II in
   identifying patients at risk of poor 1-year functional survival.
   Methods: This prospective study in patients undergoing cardiac surgery
   defined frailty using 3 common definitions: (1) the Modified Fried
   Criteria; (2) the Short Physical Performance Battery; and (3) the
   Clinical Frailty Scale. The primary outcome was functional survival,
   defined as being alive at 1 year postsurgery with a health-related
   quality of life score greater than 60 on the EuroQol-Visual Analogue
   Scale.
   Results: Of the 188 participants, 49.5\%, 52.6\%, and 31.9\% were deemed
   frail according to the Modified Fried Criteria, Short Physical
   Performance Battery, and Clinical Frailty Scale, respectively. The
   median age of our cohort was 71.0 years (29.3\% female). The probability
   of functional survival at 1 year for the entire cohort was 73.9\%. After
   adjusting for the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation
   II, patients deemed frail under the Modified Fried Criteria, Short
   Physical Performance Battery, and Clinical Frailty Scale had an
   increased odds ratio for poor functional survival of 3.44, 3.47, and
   2.08, respectively. When compared with the European System for Cardiac
   Operative Risk Evaluation II alone, the Modified Fried Criteria, Short
   Physical Performance Battery, and Clinical Frailty Scale showed an
   absolute improvement in the discrimination slope of 6.7\%, 6.5\%, and
   2.4\% with a category-free classification improvement of 59.6\%, 59.2\%,
   and 35.1\%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Preoperative frailty was associated with a 2-to 3.5-fold
   higher risk of poor functional survival 1 year after cardiac surgery.
   The addition of frailty to the European System for Cardiac Operative
   Risk Evaluation II provides incremental value in identifying patients at
   risk of poor functional survival 1 year postsurgery, regardless of
   frailty definition.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Nurse-assisted automated peritoneal dialysis (AAPD) offers a model of
   care that has been successfully used in frail dialysis populations
   internationally. AAPD offers cost savings over hospitalisation on
   peritoneal dialysis (PD) or in-centre haemodialysis (HD).
   Method
   A pilot AAPD model of care was developed in Western Australia (WA).
   Patient evaluation was measured utilising a perceptions of dialysis
   survey, clinical events, hospitalisation and peritonitis rates, Charlson
   Comorbidity Index (CCI), KDQoL-SF 36 and a survey. Staff opinions and
   perceived competency were measured by an online survey. Economic
   analysis was undertaken.
   Results
   A successful collaborative model was developed. 40 staff were trained
   and competency significantly improved during program delivery
   (p<0.0001). 15 patients with an average CCI score of 8.7 used the
   service for 18 periods of care over 18 months (mean 33 days SD 47). Two
   non-renal cause deaths and two episodes of peritonitis occurred. Patient
   opinions were extremely positive. Cost savings were estimated at
   \$620,000.
   Conclusion
   In WA, an AAPD pilot program has been successfully developed and
   delivered. A sustainable model has overcome initial hurdles. Staff have
   gained new skills and delivered effective care, demonstrated by high
   patient acceptance. The program was cost-effective compared to staying
   in hospital or transferring to HD.}},

Abstract = {{Vitamin D deficiency state is endemic in the Kashmir valley of the
   Indian subcontinent. Clinicians frequently treat patients with Vitamin D
   for diverse clinical symptoms to improve the general health and to
   reduce the frailty of elderly and these doses may at times be
   inappropriately high. Vitamin D toxicity-induced acute kidney injury
   (AKI), often considered rare, can be life-threatening and associated
   with substantial morbidity if not identified promptly. We aimed to
   describe clinical and biochemical features, risk factors, and management
   of AKI patients with Vitamin D toxicity seen at a single tertiary care
   centre in Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India,
   between January 2014 and January 2016. Evaluation included detailed
   clinical history and biochemical tests including serum calcium,
   phosphorus, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone, and
   25-hydroxyvitamin D {[}25(OH) D]. Nineteen patients with Vitamin D
   toxicity-induced AKI could be identified. Clinical manifestations
   included nausea, vomiting, altered sensorium, constipation,
   pancreatitis, AKI, acute on chronic kidney disease, and weight loss.
   Median (range) age was 64 (45-89) years. Median (range) serum 25(OH) D
   level and median (range) total serum calcium level were 99 (190-988)
   ng/mL and 139 (119-152) mg/dL, respectively. Overdose of Vitamin D
   caused by prescription of megadoses of Vitamin D was the cause of AKI in
   all cases. Median (range) cumulative Vitamin D dose was 6,000,000
   (3,600,0009,000,000) IU. On three-and six-month follow-up, the
   creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate normalized and
   returned to baseline in all patients except three cases who had
   underlying chronic kidney disease. Three patients needed
   rehospitalization for another episode of AKI. Our data demonstrate an
   emergence of Vitamin D toxicity as a cause of AKI in this part of the
   world. Irrational use of Vitamin D in megadoses resulted in AKI in all
   cases. Persistence of Vitamin D in the body for longer time resulted in
   rehospitalization of patients with AKI. Awareness among health-care
   providers regarding the toxic potential of high doses of Vitamin D and
   cautious use of Vitamin D supplements can have immense value to prevent
   this AKI.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Frailty, characterized by low physiological
   reserves, is strongly associated with vulnerability to adverse outcomes.
   Features of frailty overlap with those of advanced heart failure, making
   a distinction between them difficult. We sought to determine whether
   implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) would decrease
   frailty.
   DESIGN: Prospective, cohort study.
   SETTING: Five academic medical centers.
   PARTICIPANTS: Frail individuals (N = 29; mean age 70.6 +/- 5.5, 72.4\%
   male).
   MEASUREMENTS: Frailty, defined as having 3 or more of the Fried frailty
   criteria, was assessed before LVAD implantation and 1, 3, and 6 months
   after implantation. Other domains assessed included quality of life,
   using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire; mood, using the
   Patient Health Questionnaire; and cognitive function, using the
   Trail-Making Test Part B.
   RESULTS: After 6 months, three subjects had died, and one had undergone
   a heart transplant; of 19 subjects with serial frailty measures, the
   average number of frailty criteria decreased from 3.9 +/- 0.9 at
   baseline to 2.8 +/- 1.4 at 6 months (P=.003). Improvements were observed
   after 3 to 6 months of LVAD support, although 10 (52.6\%) participants
   still had 3 or more Fried criteria, and all subjects had at least one at
   6 months. Changes in frailty were associated with improvement in QOL but
   not with changes in mood or cognition. Higher estimated glomerular
   filtration rate at baseline was independently associated with a decrease
   in frailty.
   CONCLUSION: Frailty decreased in approximately half of older adults with
   advanced heart failure after 6 months of LVAD support. Strategies to
   enhance frailty reversal in this population are worthy of additional
   study.}},

   renal disease (ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with
   incident ESRD at a dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May
   2013 and March 2015. Frailty was assessed by using a comprehensive
   geriatric assessment protocol and defined as a multidimensional frailty
   score of >= 10. The main outcome was the composite of all-cause death or
   cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016. The median
   age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0\% of them were men.
   During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome
   was 17.4\%. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after
   adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of
   predialytic nephrologic care, female sex, and increased BMI were

   In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after adjusting for
   age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care,
   frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome.
   In repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score
   significantly improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which
   largely relied on improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be
   assessed for risk stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.}},

   Results: The participants experienced limitations and an uncertain

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Frailty is highly prevalent in the dialysis population and is associated
   with mortality. Recent studies have suggested that other dialysis
   outcomes are compromised in frail individuals. While we do not yet have
   a consensus as to the best measure of frailty, identification of these
   poor outcomes and their magnitude of association with frailty will help
   improve prognostication, allow for earlier interventions, and improve
   provider-to-patient communication.
   Recent findings
   The most widely used assessment of frailty is Fried's physical
   performance criteria. However, regardless of assessment method, frailty
   remains highly associated with mortality. More recently, frailty has
   been associated with falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, vascular
   access failure, and poor quality of life. Recent large cohort studies
   provide strong evidence that frailty assessment can provide important
   prognostic information for providers and patients both before and after
   initiation of dialysis. Trials aimed at improving frailty are limited
   and show the promise of augmenting quality of life, although more
   studies are needed to firmly establish mortality benefits.
   Summary
   We underscore the importance of frailty as a prognostic indicator and
   identify other recently established consequences of frailty. Widespread
   adoption of frailty assessment remains limited and researchers continue
   to find ways of simplifying the data collection process. Timely and
   regular assessment of frailty may allow for interventions that can
   mitigate the onset of poor outcomes and identify actionable targets for
   dialysis providers.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review and
   meta-analysis on prevalence of frailty among patients with end-stage
   renal disease (ESRD). ESRD is associated with malnutrition, chronic
   inflammation, acidemia, impaired hormonal changes, and low physical
   activity, all of which can directly and indirectly contribute to the
   development of frailty. Coexistence of ESRD and frailty has been shown
   to increase risks of adverse health outcomes. Given potential
   reversibility of frailty, it is important to examine frailty status in
   this high-risk population.
   Three databases (EMBASE, Medline, and CINAHL) were systematically
   searched for studies providing cross-sectional data of prevalence of
   frailty defined by cardiovascular health study (CHS) criteria among ESRD
   patients. Meta-analysis calculated pooled prevalence of frailty
   according to modifications of CHS criteria.
   Of 837 studies identified through the systematic review, seven studies
   were included. Three studies used both objectively measured and
   self-reported CHS criteria, and two studies each used only either
   criteria. Pooled prevalence of frailty was 36.8\% (five studies: 95\% CI
   = 29.9-44.1\%, I (2) = 82.6\%, p < 0.001) and 67.0\% (five studies: 95\%
   CI = 58.7-74.7\%, I-2 = 96.5\%, p < 0.001) according to the objectively
   measured and self-reported CHS criteria, respectively.
   More than one-third of ESRD patients were frail based on the objectively
   measured CHS criteria, and that prevalence of frailty almost doubled
   with the CHS criteria substituting self-reported physical function
   questionnaire score for objective measurements. Given substantial
   difference in prevalence of frailty depending on the modifications to
   CHS criteria, this information should be taken into account when
   evaluating frailty status among ESRD population.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The burden of chronic kidney disease is highest among older
   adults but the significance of a diminished level of kidney function in
   this heterogeneous population is poorly understood. We sought to examine
   the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and
   objective physical performance in older adults.
   Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 4,562 participants from The Irish
   Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a national cohort of community-dwelling
   adults aged >= 50 years. We used multivariable linear or quantile
   regression to model the association between categories of cystatin C
   (eGFR(cys)) or creatinine eGFR (eGFR(cr)) and the following outcomes:
   gait speed, timed-up-and-go (TUG) and grip strength. Relationships were
   further explored using natural eGFR splines. We examined effect
   modification by age in the relationship between eGFR and gait speed.
   Results: Mean (SD) age was 61.8 (8.3) years, 53.6\% were female and
   median (IQR) eGFR(cys) was 82 (70-94) mL/min/1.73m(2). In
   multivariable-adjusted models, participants in the lowest eGFR(cys)
   category (< 45 mL/min/1.73m(2)) had 3.32 cm/s (95\% confidence interval
   {[}95\% CI] 0.02-6.62) slower mean gait speed, 1.32 kg (95\% CI

   0.65) longer median TUG versus the reference group (eGFR(cys) >= 90
   mL/min/1.73m(2)). The relationship between eGFR(cys) and outcomes
   appeared linear but varied by age. The association between eGFR(cr) and
   outcomes tended towards a U-shape.
   Conclusions: Cystatin C eGFR was linearly related to poorer physical
   performance beyond middle age among community-dwelling adults. The
   non-linear relationships observed with eGFR(cr) underscore the
   limitations of creatinine as a predictor of frailty outcomes in older
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To determine the safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use compared
   with warfarin use for the treatment of venous thromboembolism.
   DESIGN
   Retrospective matched cohort study conducted between 1 January 2009 and
   31 March 2016.
   SETTING
   Community based, using healthcare data from six jurisdictions in Canada
   and the United States.
   PARTICIPANTS
   59 525 adults (12 489 DOAC users; 47 036 warfarin users) with a new
   diagnosis of venous thromboembolism and a prescription for a DOAC or
   warfarin within 30 days of diagnosis.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
   Outcomes included hospital admission or emergency department visit for
   major bleeding and all cause mortality within 90 days after starting
   treatment. Propensity score matching and shared frailty models were used
   to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of the outcomes comparing DOACs with
   warfarin. Analyses were conducted independently at each site, with
   meta-analytical methods used to estimate pooled hazard ratios across
   sites.
   RESULTS
   Of the 59 525 participants, 1967 (3.3\%) had a major bleed and 1029
   (1.7\%) died over a mean follow-up of 85.2 days. The risk of major
   bleeding was similar for DOAC compared with warfarin use (pooled hazard
   ratio 0.92, 95\% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.03), with the overall
   direction of the association favouring DOAC use. No difference was found
   in the risk of death (pooled hazard ratio 0.99, 0.84 to 1.16) for DOACs
   compared with warfarin use. There was no evidence of heterogeneity
   across centres, between patients with and without chronic kidney
   disease, across age groups, or between male and female patients.
   CONCLUSIONS
   In this analysis of adults with incident venous thromboembolism,
   treatment with DOACs, compared with warfarin, was not associated with an
   increased risk of major bleeding or all cause mortality in the first 90
   days of treatment.}},

   residence, and preexisting comorbidities.
   RESULTS Among 967 013 decedents of whom 47 514 (5\%) immigrated since
   1985, sex, socioeconomic status, urban (vs rural) residence, and causes
   of death were similar, while long-standing residents were older than
   immigrant decedents (median {[}interquartile range] age, 75 {[}58-84] vs
   80 {[}68-87] years). Recent immigrant decedents were overall more likely
   to die in intensive care (15.6\% vs 10.0\%; difference, 5.6\%; 95\% CI,
   5.2\%-5.9\%) after adjusting for differences in age, sex, income,
   geography, and cause of death (relative risk, 1.30;95\% CI, 1.27-1.32).
   In their last 6 months of life, recent immigrant decedents experienced
   more intensive care admissions (24.9\% vs 19.2\%; difference, 5.7\%;
   95\% CI, 5.3\%-6.1\%), hospital admissions (72.1\% vs 68.2\%;
   difference, 3.9\%; 95\% CI, 3.5\%-4.3\%), mechanical ventilation (21.5\%
   vs 13.6\%; difference, 7.9\%; 95\% CI, 7.5\%-8.3\%), dialysis (5.5\% vs
   3.4\%; difference, 2.1\%; 95\% CI, 1.9\%-2.3\%), percutaneous feeding
   tube placement (5.5\% vs 3.0\%; difference, 2.5\%; 95\% CI,
   2.3\%-2.8\%), and tracheostomy (2.3\% vs 1.1\%; difference, 1.2\%; 95\%
   CI, 1.1\%-1.4\%). Relative risk of dying in intensive care for recent
   immigrants compared with long-standing residents varied according to
   recent immigrant region of birth from 0.84 (95\% CI, 0.74-0.95) among
   those born in Northern and Western Europe to 1.96 (95\% CI, 1.89-2.05)
   among those born in South Asia.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among decedents in Ontario, Canada, recent
   immigrants were significantly more likely to receive aggressive care and
   to die in an intensive care unit compared with other residents. Further
   research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this association.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship
   between kidney function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and
   frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
   Methods: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling
   Japanese older adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated
   glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was determined according
   to the serum creatinine level, and participants were classified into
   four mutually exclusive categories: >60.0 (normal range), 45.0-59.9,
   30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Frailty status was defined using
   five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle weakness,
   low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
   Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the
   definition of having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used
   to examine the relationships between estimated glomerular filtration
   rate and frailty.
   Results: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney
   function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m(2))
   were more frail (odds ratio {[}ORS 1.90, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   1.01-3.59). In addition, individuals with a history of diabetes (OR
   2.76, 95\% CI 1.21-8.24) or hypertension (OR 2.53, 95\% CI 1.45-5.12)
   showed a significantly increased risk of frailty in the lower kidney
   function group, regardless of multivariate controls. Furthermore, the
   analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty in
   patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95\%

   Conclusions: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a
   higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations between
   variability in a number of biological parameters and adverse outcomes.
   As the variability may reflect impaired homeostatic regulation, we
   assessed albumin variability over time in chronic hemodialysis (HD)
   patients.
   Methods
   Data from 1346 subjects who received chronic HD treatment from May 2001
   to February 2015 were analyzed according to three phases of HD
   treatment: post-HD initiation, during maintenance HD treatment, and
   before death. The serum albumin values were grouped according to the
   time interval from HD initiation or death, and the yearly trends for
   both the albumin levels and the intra-individual albumin variability
   (quantified by the residual coefficient of variation: Alb-rCV) were
   examined. The HD initiation and death-associated changes were also
   analyzed using generalized additive mixed models. Furthermore, the
   long-term trend throughout the maintenance treatment period was
   evaluated separately using linear regression models.
   Results
   Albumin levels and variability showed distinctive changes during each of
   the 3 periods. After HD initiation, albumin variability decreased and
   reached a nadir within a year. During the subsequent maintenance
   treatment period (interquartile range = 5.2-11.0 years), the log Alb-rCV
   showed a significant upward trend (mean slope: 0.011 +/- 0.035/year),
   and its overall mean was -1.49 +/- 0.08 (equivalent to an Alb-rCV of
   3.22\%). During the 1-2 years before death, this upward trend clearly
   accelerated, and the mean log Alb-rCV in the last year of life was -1.36
   +/- 0.17. The albumin levels and variability were negatively correlated
   with each other and exhibited exactly opposite movements throughout the
   course of chronic HD treatment. Different from the albumin levels,
   albumin variability was not dependent on chronological age but was
   independently associated with an individual's aging and death process.
   Conclusion
   The observed upward trend in albumin variability seems to be consistent
   with a presumed aging-related decline in homeostatic capacity.}},

Title = {{Development and validation of QMortality risk prediction algorithm to
   estimate short term risk of death and assess frailty: cohort study}},
Journal = {{BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{358}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES
   To derive and validate a risk prediction equation to estimate the short
   term risk of death, and to develop a classification method for frailty
   based on risk of death and risk of unplanned hospital admission.
   DESIGN
   Prospective open cohort study.
   PARTICIPANTS
   Routinely collected data from 1436 general practices contributing data
   to QResearch in England between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used
   to develop the scores and a separate set of 357 practices to validate
   the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 65-100 years were in the
   derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the validation cohort.
   METHODS
   Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort were used to
   derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation of the
   risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age, sex,
   ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index,
   medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of
   recent investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were
   determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for
   each age and ethnic group. The new mortality equation was used in
   conjunction with the existing QAdmissions equation (which predicts risk
   of unplanned hospital admission) to classify patients into frailty
   groups.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
   The primary outcome was all cause mortality.
   RESULTS
   During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the derivation cohort
   arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The final model
   included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic group,
   smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the
   past 12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive
   heart failure, corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia,
   epilepsy, learning disability, leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or
   pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, poor mobility, rheumatoid arthritis,
   chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, venous
   thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result, high
   platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite
   loss, unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good
   calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination.
   In women, the equation explained 55.6\% of the variation in time to
   death (R-2), and had very good discrimination-the D statistic was 2.29,
   and Harrell's C statistic value was 0.85. The corresponding values for
   men were 53.1\%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining predicted risks of
   mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7\% of patients (n=13
   665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4\% (n=46 770) as moderately
   frail, 43.1\% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8\% (n=223 790) as
   fit.
   CONCLUSIONS
   We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of death
   in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social,
   and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate
   validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction
   with the QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty
   groups (known as QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be
   identified for further assessment or interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives A geriatric assessment is an appropriate
   method for identifying frail elderly patients. In CKD, it may contribute
   to optimize personalized care. However, a geriatric assessment is time
   consuming. The purpose of our study was to compare easy to apply frailty
   screening tools with the geriatric assessment in patients eligible for
   dialysis.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements A total of 123 patients
   on incident dialysis >= 65 years old were included <3 weeks before to <=
   2 weeks after dialysis initiation, and all underwent a geriatric
   assessment. Patients with impairment in two or more geriatric domains on
   the geriatric assessment were considered frail. The diagnostic abilities
   of six frailty screening tools were compared with the geriatric
   assessment: the Fried Frailty Index, the Groningen Frailty Indicator,
   Geriatric8, the Identification of Seniors at Risk, the Hospital Safety
   Program, and the clinical judgment of the nephrologist. Outcome measures
   were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
   predictive value.
   Results In total, 75\% of patients were frail according to the geriatric
   assessment. Sensitivity of frailty screening tools ranged from 48\%
   (Fried Frailty Index) to 88\% (Geriatric8). The discriminating features
   of the clinical judgment were comparable with the other screening tools.
   The Identification of Seniors at Risk screening tool had the best
   discriminating abilities, with a sensitivity of 74\%, a specificity of
   80\%, a positive predictive value of 91\%, and a negative predictive
   value of 52\%. The negative predictive value was poor for all tools,
   which means that almost one half of the patients screened as fit
   (nonfrail) had two or more geriatric impairments on the geriatric
   assessment.
   Conclusions All frailty screening tools are able to detect geriatric
   impairment in elderly patients eligible for dialysis. However, all
   applied screening tools, including the judgment of the nephrologist,
   lack the discriminating abilities to adequately rule out frailty
   compared with a geriatric assessment.}},

Pages = {{163-174}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Survival for patients commencing renal replacement therapy
   is around 90\% in the first year and 83\% at two years after starting
   dialysis. The factors that appear to predict mortality are comorbidity
   and frailty associated with kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate,
   age and biochemical factors.
   Objectives: To analyse the condition of patients starting renal
   replacement therapy, based on biomarkers commonly used in clinical
   practice and their association with mortality, measured 6 and 12 months
   after initiating replacement therapy.
   Methods: A one-year prospective follow-up study with 189 patients.
   Sociodemographic variables, aetiology of renal disease, comorbidities,
   prior nephrology service monitoring, prior renal transplantation and
   biochemical parameters at the time of initiating replacement therapy
   were analysed.
   Results: The overall percentage of death during the one-year follow-up
   was 6.87\%, with 64\% of deaths occurring during the first six months.
   The only variable independently associated with mortality was low
   albumin levels.
   Conclusion: Although most patients in this centre are monitored by a
   nephrologist prior to starting replacement therapy, many nevertheless
   fail to achieve the biochemical targets recommended. One such parameter
   is albumin, which proved at the start of replacement therapy to be an
   independent predictor of mortality. Findings of this study show the need
   to intervene on certain biochemical parameters during the pre-dialysis
   stage and at the start of dialysis, in order to improve survival in this
   group of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background Frailty increases early hospital readmission and mortality
   risk among kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. Although frailty
   represents a high-risk state for this population, the correlates of
   frailty, the patterns of the 5 frailty components, and the risk
   associated with these patterns are unclear.
   Methods Six hundred sixty-three KT recipients were enrolled in a cohort
   study of frailty in transplantation (12/2008-8/2015). Frailty,
   activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) disability,
   Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale depression,
   education, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were measured. We
   used multinomial regression to identify frailty correlates. We
   identified which patterns of the 5 components were associated with
   mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results Frailty prevalence was 19.5\%. Older recipients (adjusted
   prevalence ratio {[}PR], 2.22; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   1.21-4.07) were more likely to be frail. The only other factors that
   were independently associated with frailty were IADL disability (PR,
   3.22; 95\% CI, 1.72-6.06), depressive symptoms (PR, 11.31; 95\% CI,
   4.02-31.82), less than a high school education (PR, 3.10; 95\% CI,
   1.30-7.36), and low HRQOL (fair/poor: PR, 3.71; 95\% CI, 1.48-9.31). The
   most common pattern was poor grip strength, low physical activity, and
   slowed walk speed (19.4\%). Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged
   as having an association with post-KT mortality. KT recipients with
   exhaustion and slowed walking speed (hazards ratio = 2.43; 95\% CI,
   1.17-5.03) and poor grip strength, exhaustion, and slowed walking speed
   (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95\% CI, 1.14-5.97) were at increased mortality
   risk.
   Conclusions Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty
   among KT recipients; however, factors rarely measured as part of
   clinical practice, namely, HRQOL, IADL disability, and depressive
   symptoms, were significant correlates of frailty. Redefining the frailty
   phenotype may be needed to improve risk stratification for KT
   recipients.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Understanding the relationship between patient risk
   factors, postoperative complications, and morbidity and mortality is
   important when considering elective endovascular aortic aneurysm repair
   (E-EVAR) performed to prevent aneurysm rupture mortality. We aimed to
   stratify complications in E-EVAR and explore their relationship with
   postoperative death.
   Methods: E-EVAR cases from 2012 NSQIP were identified. 30-day
   complications were categorized as major (MAJCX) or minor (MINCX) using
   the Clavien-Dindo classification. Failure to rescue (FTR) was defined as
   death following a complication. Univariate and multivariate analyses
   were performed to identify associations between patient risk factors,
   complications, and mortality. Significance set at P < 0.05.
   Results: 3344 E-EVAR's were analyzed, with 155 (4.6\%) MINCX, 106
   (3.2\%) MAJCX, and 39 (1.2\%) mortality. Significant univariate risk
   factors differed between MINCX (preoperative dyspnea 27\% vs 19\%, COPD
   32\% vs19\%, HTN 87\% vs 79\%, functional dependence 9\% vs 3\%) and
   MAJCX (female sex 33\% vs 18\%, preoperative diabetes 30\% vs 17\%,
   dyspnea 40\% vs 19\%, COPD 46\% vs 20\%, anticoagulant use 20\% vs 11\%,
   and functional dependence 13\% vs 3\%). 24 of 39 (62\%) of deaths were
   preceded by a complication. FTR was more frequent following MAJCX than
   MINCX (16\% vs 4.5\%, P = 0.002), and occurred most commonly after renal
   failure with dialysis (33\% mortality with complication), cardiac arrest
   (33\%), septic shock (22\%), and reintubation (22\%). Independent
   predictors of MAJCX included female sex (OR 2, P = 0.001), COPD (OR 2, P
   = 0.009), and anticoagulant use (OR 2, P = 0.001). Mortality was
   independently predicted by MAJCX (OR 29, P < 0.001), MINCX (OR 8, P <
   0.001), and preoperative renal failure (OR 11.6, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The majority of deaths within 30 days following E-EVAR are
   preceded by a complication; both MAJCX and MINCX predict mortality. FTR
   is more common after MAJCX; prevention efforts should take this into
   account. Identified risk factors should be taken into consideration when
   considering EEVAR. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

   utilization after kidney transplantation. Efforts to intervene with
   post-transplant physical therapy have been met with limited success, in
   large part due to high study dropout. We reviewed the literature on
   chronic kidney disease and exercise to propose a clinical framework for
   physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, scheduled for before
   the transplant. This framework may lead to better patient retention and
   compliance, and thus demonstrate better efficacy in mitigating the
   effects of frailty and poor fitness after kidney transplantation.}},

   disease patients}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Background. Frailty exhibits a high prevalence in end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) patients and is associated with adverse health-related
   outcomes, including falls and fractures. Available studies do not
   address whether frailty is associated with temporal changes in BMD. We
   evaluated this issue by analyzing the follow-up dual energy X-ray
   absorptiometry (DXA) results in an ESRD cohort.
   Methods. In 2015, we enrolled forty-three ESRD patients, divided into
   frail, pre-frail, and robust ones based on a validated simple FRAIL
   scale, all receiving DXA at baseline. After one year of follow-up,
   survivors received another DXA, and we calculated the absolute and
   percentage changes in area, bone mineral density (BMD), T-, and Z-scores
   of lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN) between baseline and foflow-up
   examinations.
   Results. Among all, frail individuals with ESRD had significantly lower
   average lumbar spine area, lower L4, FN, and total BMD and T-scores,
   lower FN and total Z-scores than non-frail ones, without differences in
   gender, body mass index, dialysis duration, and comorbidities.
   Furthermore, we discovered frail ESRD patients had significantly more
   prominent decrease in average lumbar spine area, percentage changes in
   Ll Z-scores and average lumbar spine area, and a trend toward more
   prominent decrease in L4 area than non-frail ones after one year of
   follow-up.
   Conclusions. Baseline frailty might be associated with deteriorating
   bone health, including shrinking L-spine areas and a more rapid decrease
   in L-spine Z scores, among ESRD patients. This frailty-bone association
   should be highlighted during our care of frail individuals with ESRD.}},

Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning are
   frequently impaired in dialysis patients and impairment in these domains
   relates to poor outcome. The aim of this analysis was to compare the
   prevalence of impairment as measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of
   Life-Short Form (KDQOL-SF) subscales between the different age
   categories and to assess whether the association of these subscales with
   mortality differs between younger and older dialysis patients.
   Methods: This study included data from 714 prevalent hemodialysis
   patients, from 26 centres, who were enrolled in the CONvective TRAnsport
   STudy (CONTRAST NCT00205556, 09-12-2005). Baseline HRQOL domains were
   evaluated for patients < 65 years, 65-74 years and over 75 years.
   Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to assess
   the relation between the separate domains and 2-year mortality.
   Results: Emotional health was higher in patients over the age of 75
   compared to younger patients (mean level 71, 73 and 77 for increasing
   age categories respectively, p = 0.02), whilst physical functioning was
   significantly lower in older patients (mean level 60, 48 and 40, p <
   0.01). A low level of physical functioning (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.72 {[}
   95\% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.02-2.73]), emotional health (HR 1.85 {[}
   95\% 1.30-2.63]), and social functioning (HR 1.59 {[} 95\% CI
   1.12-2.26]), was individually associated with an increased 2-year
   mortality within the whole population. The absence of effect
   modification suggests no evidence for different relations within the
   older age groups.
   Conclusions: In dialysis patients, older age is associated with lower
   levels of physical functioning, whilst the level of emotional health is
   not associated with age. KDQOL-SF domains physical functioning,
   emotional health and social functioning are independently associated
   with mortality in prevalent younger and older hemodialysis patients.}},

   The International guidelineswere limited to thosewith peer-reviewprocess

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Technique failure is a major limitation of
   peritoneal dialysis. Our study aimed to identify center- and
   patient-level predictors of peritoneal dialysis technique failure.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements All patients on incident
   peritoneal dialysis in Australia from 2004 to 2014 were included in the
   study using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and
   Transplant Registry. Center- and patient-level characteristics
   associated with technique failure were evaluated using Cox shared
   frailty models. Death-censored technique failure and cause-specific
   technique failure were analyzed as secondary outcomes.
   Results The study included 9362 patients from 51 centers in Australia.
   The technique failure rate was 0.35 (95\% confidence interval, 0.34 to
   0.36) episodes per patient-year, with a sevenfold variation across
   centers that was mainly associated with center-level characteristics.
   Technique failure was significantly less likely in centers with larger
   proportions of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (>29\%;
   adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95\% confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.94) and
   more likely in smaller centers (<16 new patients per year; adjusted
   hazard ratio, 1.10; 95\% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.21) and centers
   with lower proportions of patients achieving target baseline serum
   phosphate levels (<40\%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.03 to 1.29). Similar results were observed for
   death-censored technique failure, except that center target phosphate
   achievement was not significantly associated. Technique failure due to
   infection, social reasons, mechanical causes, or death was variably
   associated with center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal
   dialysis, and/or target phosphate achievement, automated peritoneal
   dialysis exposure, icodextrin use, and antifungal use. The variation of
   hazards of technique failure across centers was reduced by 28\% after
   adjusting for patient-specific factors and an additional 53\% after
   adding center-specific factors.
   Conclusions Technique failure varies widely across centers in Australia.
   A significant proportion of this variation is related to potentially
   modifiable center characteristics, including peritoneal dialysis center
   size, proportion of patients on peritoneal dialysis, and proportion of
   patients on peritoneal dialysis achieving target phosphate level.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Frailty is common among patients on
   hemodialysis and associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is
   known about changes in frailty over time and the factors associated with
   those changes.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements To address these
   questions, we examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate
   the Value of Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of
   Obesity and Survival in ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was
   assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. We used ordinal generalized
   estimating equations analyses and modeled frailty (on a scale from zero
   to five possible components) and death during follow-up.
   Results The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution
   of frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most
   participants' scores changed, with patients improving almost as often as
   worsening (overall change, 0.2 points per year; 95\% confidence
   interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity (0.6 points per year; 95\%
   confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7 points per year; 95\%
   confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher frailty
   scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores
   (1.1 points per g /dl; 95\% confidence interval, 1.5 to 0.7). In
   addition, patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less
   likely to become frail, with each 1-g /dl increase in albumin associated
   with a 0.4-point reduction in frailty score (95\% confidence interval,
   0.80 to 0.05). To examine the underpinnings of the association between
   serum albumin and frailty, we included serum IL-6, normalized protein
   catabolic rate, and patient self-report of hospitalization within the
   last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and hospitalization were
   statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at any point
   and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic
   rate was not independently associated with frailty.
   Conclusions There was substantial year to year variability in frailty
   scores, with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and
   worsening. Markers of inflammation and hospitalization were
   independently associated with worsening frailty. Studies should examine
   whether interventions to address inflammation or posthospitalization
   rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the association between cystatin C (cysC) levels and
   risks of progression of frailty status or death in older men.
   Prospective study of 2,613 men without overt frailty aged 67 years and
   older enrolled in the MrOS ancillary sleep study. Baseline measurements
   included serum cysC, serum creatinine, and frailty status. Repeat
   frailty status, performed an average of 3.4 years later, was assessed as
   an ordinal outcome of robust, intermediate stage (prefrail), frail or
   dead.
   Mean age was 75.7 years. Men with higher cysC were older and had a
   higher comorbidity burden. After adjusting for age, clinical site, and
   race, higher cysC was associated with nearly twofold greater odds of
   being classified as intermediate stage versus robust (OR quartile 4 vs
   1; 1.82, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.35-2.45), a threefold greater
   odds of frailty versus robust (OR quartile 4 vs 1; 3.13, 95\% CI
   2.03-4.82), and a more than fivefold greater odds of death versus robust
   (OR quartile 4 vs 1; 5.48, 95\% CI 2.98-10.08). Results were similar for
   cysC-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). This
   relationship was attenuated but persisted after adjusting for additional
   potential confounders including baseline frailty status, body mass
   index, smoking status, comorbidity burden, self-reported disability, and
   serum albumin. In contrast, neither serum creatinine nor
   creatinine-based eGFR was associated in a graded manner with higher
   risks of development of frailty or death.
   In this cohort of older men without overt frailty, higher cysC and
   cysC-based eGFR, but not creatinine or creatinine-based estimates of
   GFR, were associated with increased risks of frailty or death. These
   findings suggest that higher cysC level may be a promising biomarker for
   unsuccessful aging as manifested by increased risks of frailty and

Abstract = {{Elevated blood pressure is one of the most significant risk factor for
   the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD); its treatment is a
   milestone in CKD management. While it is accepted that a stricter blood
   pressure control is indicated in patients with proteinuria or
   microalbuminuria, the exact degree of blood pressure reduction to be
   obtained in CKD patients is still under debate. Following more recent
   interpretation of old trials, a BP target for <140/90 mmHg is suggested
   for non-proteinuric CKD patients. In those with microalbuminuria/
   proteinuria, the ideal blood pressure target should be <= 130/80 mmHg.
   Recently, the SPRINT trial put new emphasis on a stricter blood pressure
   control, mainly from the cardiovascular point of view. The blockers of
   the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are recommended as first line
   treatment in all CKD hypertensive patients with micro or
   macroalbuminuria either diabetics or not. However, their
   nephroprotective efficacy is less relevant in non-proteinuric patients.
   The dual RAS blockade was proposed as an additional option. Despite a
   greater antiproteinuric effect, some large trials in patients at high
   cardiovascular risk did not demonstrate significant advantage on hard
   endpoint. Its use is now contraindicated in diabetic CKD patients. Given
   that RAS blockers can cause acute derangements in kidney function and
   hyperkalemia, caution is needed with their use, especially in frail and
   old patients with cardiovascular disease or in the presence of advanced
   CKD.}},

   A total of 1496 patients with chronic kidney disease who initiated
   dialysis at 17 centers participating in the Aichi Cohort Study of the

   A log-rank test for the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed significant
   differences between the three groups in all-cause, CVD-related, and

Abstract = {{The literature reveals that current nephrology practice in obtaining
   informed consent for dialysis falls short of ethical and legal
   requirements. Meeting these requirements represents a significant
   challenge, especially because the benefits and risks of dialysis have
   shifted significantly with the growing number of older, comorbid
   patients. The importance of informed consent for dialysis is heightened
   by several concerns, including: (1) the proportion of predialysis
   patients and patients on dialysis who lack capacity in decision making
   and (2) whether older, comorbid, and frail patients understand their
   poor prognosis and the full implications to their independence and
   functional status of being on dialysis. This article outlines the
   ethical and legal requirements for a valid informed consent to dialysis:
   (1) the patient was competent, (2) the consent was made voluntarily, and
   (3) the patient was given sufficient information in an understandable
   manner to make the decision. It then considers the application of these
   requirements to practice across different countries. In the process of
   informed consent, the law requires a discussion by the physician of the
   material risks associated with dialysis and alternative options. We
   argue that, legally and ethically, this discussion should include both
   the anticipated trajectory of the illness and the effect on the life of
   the patient with particular regard to the outcomes most important to the
   individual. In addition, a discussion should occur about the option of a
   conservative, nondialysis pathway. These requirements ensure that the
   ethical principle of respect for patient autonomy is honored in the
   context of dialysis. Nephrologists need to be open to, comfortable with,
   and skillful in communicating this information. From these clear, open,
   ethically, and legally valid consent discussions, a significant dividend
   will hopefully flow for patients, families, and nephrologists alike.}},

Abstract = {{Background The risk of incorrect medication dosing is high in frail
   older people. Therefore, accurate assessment of the glomerular
   filtration rate is important.
   Objective The objective of this study was to compare the estimated
   glomerular filtration rate using creatinine-and cystatin C-based
   formulae, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
   (CKD-EPI) equations, in frail older people. We hypothesized that frailty
   determines the difference between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based
   formulae.
   Methods The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C
   was determined using (cross-sectional) data of 55 patients (mean age 73
   years) admitted to a psychiatric ward for older adults. The level of
   agreement of these estimations was assessed by a Bland-Altman analysis.
   In all patients, the Rockwood's Frailty Index was derived and correlated
   with the mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C.
   Results The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine (mean 71.2
   mL/min/1.73 m(2)) and CKD-EPI cystatin C (mean 57.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2))
   was 13.6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (p < 0.0001). The two standard deviation limit
   in the Bland-Altman plot was large (43.2 mL/min/1.73 m2), which
   represents a low level of agreement. The Frailty Index did not correlate
   with the mean difference between the creatinine-and cystatin C-based
   glomerular filtration rate (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.182, p =
   0.184).
   Conclusions There was a significant gap between a creatinine- and
   cystatin C-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate, irrespective
   of frailty. The range of differences between the commonly used estimated
   glomerular filtration rate formulae might result in clinically relevant
   differences in drug prescription and differences in chronic kidney
   disease staging.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in
   the general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is
   unclear whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney
   failure.
   Methods: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults
   with end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in
   Europe and South America designed to examine the association between
   periodontitis and all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality in
   people on long-term hemodialysis. Participants were matched 1:1 on their
   propensity score for moderate to severe periodontitis assessed using the
   World Health Organization Community Periodontal Index. A random-effects
   Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared frailty to account
   for clustering of mortality risk within countries.
   Results: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6\%) had moderate
   to severe periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score
   methods to generate a matched cohort of participants with periodontitis
   similar to those with none or mild periodontal disease, moderate to
   severe periodontitis was associated with a lower risk of all-cause (9.1
   versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74, 95\% confidence
   interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 person
   years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations
   were not changed substantially when participants were limited to those
   with 12 or more natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes
   of cardiovascular death.
   Conclusion: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does
   not appear to be associated with an increased risk of early death in
   adults treated with hemodialysis.}},

Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on
   dialysis and is traditionally measured using tools that assess physical
   impairment. Alternate measurement tools highlight cognitive and
   functional domains, requiring clinician, patient, and/or caregiver
   input. In this study, we compared frailty measures for incident dialysis
   patients that incorporate patient, clinician, and caregiver perspectives
   with an aim to contrast the measured prevalence of frailty using tools
   derived from different conceptual frameworks.
   Methods: A prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients was
   conducted between February 2014 and June 2015. Frailty was assessed at
   dialysis onset using: 1) modified definition of Fried Phenotype
   (Dialysis Morbidity Mortality Study definition, DMMS); 2) Clinical
   Frailty Scale (CFS); 3) Frailty Assessment Care Planning Tool (provides
   CFS grading, FACT-CFS); and 4) Frailty Index (FI). Measures were
   compared via correlation and sensitivity/specificity analyses.
   Results: A total of 98 patients participated (mean age of 61 +/- 14
   years). Participants were primarily Caucasian (91\%), male (58\%), and
   the majority started on hemodialysis (83\%). The median score for both
   the CFS and FACT-CFS was 4 (interquartile range of 3-5). The mean FI
   score was 0.31 (standard deviation +/- 0.16). The DMMS identified 78\%
   of patients as frail. The FACT-CFS demonstrated highest correlation (r =
   0.71) with the FI, while the DMMS was most sensitive (97\%, 100\%) and a
   CFS >= 5 most specific (100\%, 77\%) at corresponding FI cutoff values
   (>0.21, >0.45).
   Conclusions: Frailty assessments of incident dialysis patients that
   include clinician, caregiver and patient perspectives have moderate to
   strong correlation with the FI. At specified FI cutoff values, the
   FACT-CFS and DMMS are highly sensitive measures of frailty. The CFS and
   FACT-CFS may represent viable alternative screening tools in dialysis
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Patients reaching end-stage kidney disease face difficult decisions,
   including choosing among renal replacement therapies (RRTs). With an
   increasingly elderly and frail population, there is growing interest in
   conservative kidney management (CKM) as a viable alternative to
   dialysis. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a patient-centered approach to
   these decisions, in which choices are viewed within the explicitly
   discussed values and preferences of the patient. Patient decision aids
   (PDAs) are tools designed to facilitate these discussions. The choice
   between dialysis and CKM is particularly complex, given the poor
   prognostication data for CKM. This is an emerging area for PDAs in
   nephrology. This review highlights care gaps around SDM for dialysis
   versus CKM, presents current PDAs for making choices about RRTs and CKM
   and discusses exciting new work around the development of novel PDAs.
   Recent findings
   Many PDAs have been created recently, primarily to help with decisions
   about RRTs. Three new PDAs are in testing phases to aid with the more
   complex decision of choosing between dialysis and CKM.
   Summary
   International nephrology communities are moving toward improved SDM with
   their patients and PDAs are being developed to facilitate this process.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes
   over the last decade has resulted in increasing numbers of frail older
   patients with a combination of these conditions. Current treatment
   guidelines may not necessarily be relevant for such patients, who are
   mostly excluded from the trials upon which these recommendations are
   based. There is a paucity of data upon which to base the management of
   older patients with CKD. Nearly all current guidelines recommend
   less-tight glycaemic control for the older population, citing the lack
   of proven medium-term benefits and concerns about the high short-term
   risk of hypoglycaemia. However, reports from large landmark trials have
   shown potential benefits for both microvascular and macrovascular
   complications, though the relevance of these findings to this specific
   population is uncertain. The trials have also highlighted potential
   alternative explanations for the hazards of intensive glycaemic control.
   These include depression, low endogenous insulin reserve, low body mass
   index and side effects of the medication. Over the last few years, newer
   classes of hypoglycaemic drugs with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia have
   emerged. This article aims to present a balanced view of advantages and
   disadvantages of intense glycaemic control in this group of patients,
   which we hope will help the clinician and patient to come to an
   individualized management approach.}},

Abstract = {{AimThe objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney
   disease-related frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their
   probable causes, mechanisms and the interventions.
   MethodsStudies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the
   relationship between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and
   cognitive impairment. Of the 1694 studies from the initial search,
   longitudinal studies (n=22) with the keywords Cognitive and CKD and
   longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n=5) with the keywords Frailty
   and CKD were included in final analysis.
   ResultsBy pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a
   relationship between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive
   impairment in major studies. Vascular disease is likely an important
   mediator, particularly for cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular
   factors also play an important role. Many of the other mechanisms that
   contribute to impaired cognitive function and increased frailty in CKD
   remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication therapy did not
   obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment strategies,
   but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life might
   decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in
   this population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both
   microvascular health and other factors, may have substantial benefits
   for both the cognitive impairments and physical frailty in this
   vulnerable population.
   ConclusionsChronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and
   cognitive impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible
   causes. The mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty
   and cognitive impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions
   may be effective therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic
   kidney disease. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 529-544.}},

Abstract = {{Background In Australia, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
   is increasing steadily, especially amongst older people. The extent to
   which dialysis prolongs life and its effect on quality of life (QoL) of
   elderly patients who are frail or disabled also remains unclear.
   Patients and methods We conducted a single-centre, prospective study to
   compare the trajectory of symptom burden and functional status in
   elderly patients (age >65 years) with stage 5 CKD receiving renal
   replacement therapy (RRT), n=12, versus those managed conservatively
   without dialysis, n=8. Dialysis patients were younger (mean age 73(7)
   versus 84(6) years, p=0.001). Groups were similar at baseline in
   functional status, nutrition, co-morbidity and frailty assessments. All
   patients were still alive after six months.
   Results Dialysis patients reported a greater improvement in overall
   symptom scores by six months and no dialysis patient reported severe or
   overwhelming symptoms while one (13\%) conservatively managed patient
   reported severe pruritus. There was no change in functional status in
   both groups over a six-month follow-up period.

Abstract = {{Frailty is a distinct phenotype that is highly prevalent in chronic
   kidney disease (CKD) and appears to be more prevalent with decreasing
   glomerular filtration rate. Exercise training or intervention to

   exercise interventions improve outcomes across the spectrum of CKD,
   including patients treated with dialysis, patients treated with dialysis
   face barriers to exercise that patients with predialysis CKD do not.
   Rehabilitation at earlier stages of CKD (or prehabilitation before

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the association between hypertension at age 90
   years, treatment, and 5-year mortality.
   Design: A prospective observational study of a representative
   community-dwelling birth cohort (born 1920-1921) by the Jerusalem
   Longitudinal Study (1990-2015).
   Setting: Home-assessment.
   Participants: 480 subjects aged 90, examined 2010-2011. Measurements and
   Main Outcome: Hypertension was defined as treatment with
   antihypertensive medication, and/or sitting blood pressure (BP) > 140
   mmHg systolic or >90 mmHg diastolic. Subjects were categorized as
   normotensive (NORMO), untreated hypertensive (NonTx-HTN), and treated
   hypertensive (Tx-HTN); assessment included activities of daily living
   (ADL), handgrip strength, and all-cause mortality (2010-2015).
   Results: NORMO, NonTx-HTN, and Tx-HTN prevalence was 12.3\% (59/480),
   12.7\% (61/480), and 75\% (360/480). Tx-HTN had higher rates of low
   education, depression, low physical activity, chronic heart failure,
   ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease. Five-year survival was
   lowest among Tx-HTN and highest among NonTx-HTN versus NORMO among all
   subjects (51\%, 72\%, 61\%; P = .01), and subgroups with ADL
   independence (64\%, 91\%, 74\%; n = 265, P = .01), ADL dependence (37\%,
   55\%, 48\%; n = 194, P = .36), high grip strength (66\%, 85\%, 83\%; n =
   227, P = .04), low grip strength (38\%, 60\%, 61\%; n = 149, P = .06),
   low comorbidity (64\%, 84\%, 70\%; n = 219, P = .13), and high
   comorbidity (42\%, 60\%, 54\%; n = 257, P = .12). Unadjusted mortality
   hazards ratios (HR) were higher for Tx-HTN {[}HR 1.38; 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 0.89-2.15] versus NonTx-HTN (HR 0.7; 95\% CI 0.37-1.31)
   compared to NORMO (HR 1.0). After adjusting for medical and functional
   covariates, adjusted HRs were higher for Tx-HTN (HR 1.39; 95\% CI
   0.83-2.33) versus NonTx-HTN (HR 0.67; 95\% CI 0.31-1.45) compared to
   NORMO (HR 1.0). Findings were consistent in subsets according to ADL
   status, grip strength, and comorbidity.
   Conclusions: Untreated hypertension at age 90 years was not associated

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate
   hypertension (HTN) management in patients 80 years of age and older who
   reside in a large, long-term care (LTC) facility.
   Data source: A retrospective chart audit was conducted on 75 charts of
   patients 80 years of age and older and who had a diagnosis of HTN. Using
   the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart
   Association (ACCF/AHA) Expert Consensus Document on Management of
   Hypertension in the Elderly as a guide, blood pressure readings,
   significant comorbidities, and antihypertensive medication utilization
   were analyzed.
   Conclusions: LTC residents in this sample were often not treated
   according to expert recommendations. Specifically, analysis revealed
   overtreatment of uncomplicated HTN and undertreatment of those with
   comorbid conditions. Additionally, those with diabetes mellitus and
   chronic kidney disease were infrequently prescribed ace
   inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, as recommended.
   Implications for practice: Utilizing evidence-based practice (EBP)
   guidelines affords the best avenue for providing safe and effective
   treatment of HTN. While expert recommendations are available,
   researchers seldom recruit frail elders in LTC facilities into treatment
   investigations. In the absence of populationspecific EBP guidelines,
   nurse practitioners must rely on expert opinion and diagnostic reasoning
   to individualize HTN treatment to this unique and vulnerable population.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the clinical implications of frailty in
   chronic kidney disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and
   chronic peritoneal dialysis.
   Design: In this prospective study, all of the participants completed the
   Short Form of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, Korean
   version, to determine their frailty phenotype. We also obtained blood
   chemistry and demographic data at enrollment. Data regarding the history
   of hospitalization and death were collected during the follow- up
   period.
   Subjects: We recruited 1,658 patients (1,255 maintenance hemodialysis
   and 403 chronic peritoneal dialysis) from multidialysis units (n 5 27).
   We excluded patients who had been hospitalized in the previous 3 months.
   Main Outcome Measures: Hospitalization and survival rate during study
   period.
   Results: The participants'mean agewas 55.2 +/- 11.9 years old, and
   55.2\% weremale. Among the participants, 34.8\% were rated as frail and
   45.7\% as prefrail. Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant
   associations of frailty with age, comorbidity, disability, unemployment,
   higher body mass index, and a lower educational level. During the
   follow- up period (median 17.1 months), 608 patients (79 not frail, 250
   prefrail, and 279 frail) were hospitalized, and 87 patients (10 not
   frail, 24 prefrail, and 53 frail) died (P <.001). Frailty was associated
   with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95\% confidence
   interval: 1.38-2.36) and mortality (hazard ratio, 2.37, 95\% confidence
   interval: 1.11-5.02).
   Conclusion: The frailty phenotype was common even in, prevalent end-
   stage renal disease patients on dialysis, and was significantly
   associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality.

Abstract = {{It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with
   increased postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with
   peripheral artery disease who underwent lower extremity surgical
   revascularization; however, outcomes after peripheral vascular
   intervention (PVI) are less well established. This study sought to
   determine the impact of CKD on adverse outcomes in patients with
   peripheral artery disease who underwent PVI. Using data from the Veteran
   Affairs Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System Program, we
   identified a cohort of 755 patients who underwent lower extremity PVI
   from June 2005 to August 2010 at 33 sites. The outcomes of interest were
   mortality, progression to dialysis, myocardial infarction, limb
   amputation, and stroke. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox
   proportional hazard frailty models assessed the association between CKD
   and adverse outcomes. Of the patients who underwent lower extremity PVI,
   201 patients (27\%) had CKD. The presence of CKD was associated with
   decreased survival (5-year survival probability of CKD compared with
   non-CKD: 49.9\% {[}41.6\% to 59.9\%] vs 80.1\% {[}76.2\% to 84.1]),
   which persisted after risk adjustment (BR 1.57; 95\% confidence interval
   1.13 to 2.19). In addition, there was a significant association between
   CKD and progression to dialysis (HR 6.62; 95\% confidence interval 2.25
   to 19.43). In contrast, there was no association between CKD and
   re-hospitalization for myocardial infarction, limb amputation, or
   stroke. In conclusion, CKD is present in 1 of 4 patients who underwent
   PVI and is associated with increased risk of mortality and progression
   to dialysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. - Nocardiosis are uncommon. The diagnosis may be
   difficult, with significant morbidity and mortality, often occurring on
   frail patients. Few data are available in France.
   Methods. - A retrospective single center study was conducted from 2002
   to 2014 and included all patients with at least one positive
   microbiological sample for Nocardia with a follow-up in our hospital.
   Results. - Nineteen patients, including 15 men, were included with a
   mean age of 58 years (25-85). Seventeen had a risk factor (lung diseases
   {[}13], corticosteroids {[}12], solid neoplasia {[}2], HIV infection
   {[}2], diabetes mellitus {[}3], kidney transplant {[}2], lymphopenia
   {[}1]). Infections' locations were: pulmonary (12), brain (3), skin (2),
   lymph node (1) and corneal (1). The slow growth leads to a median of 35
   days for a positive result (3-95). Nine species were identified. Fifteen
   patients (79\%) received one or more lines of antibiotics including:
   cotrimoxazole (9), amoxicillin (7) cefotaxime/ceftriaxone (7) imipenem
   (3), or amikacin (3). The average duration of antibiotic therapy was 207
   days. Four patients did not receive antibiotics due to a late result or
   a bacterial co-infection masking nocardiosis. Five patients died (26\%)
   including 2 with cerebral nocardiosis. Six patients were cured, 4
   suffered a relapse, 4 had an unknown evolution, and 1 was still treated.
   Conclusion.- Our study shows that nocardiosis is a disease difficult to
   treat. A better understanding of this type of infection is necessary.

Abstract = {{Background: Mobility limitation is highly prevalent among older adults
   and is central to the loss of functional independence. Dynamic
   isokinetic muscle fatigue testing may reveal increased vulnerability to
   disability and mortality beyond strength testing.
   Methods: We studied community-dwelling older adults enrolled in the
   Health Aging and Body Composition study (age range: 71-82) free of
   mobility disability and who underwent isokinetic muscle fatigue testing
   in 1999-2000 (n = 1,963). Isokinetic quadriceps work and fatigue index
   was determined over 30 repetitions and compared with isometric
   quadriceps maximum torque. Work was normalized to leg lean mass
   accounting for gender-specific differences (specific work). The primary
   outcome was incident persistent severe lower extremity limitation
   (PSLL), defined as two consecutive reports of either having a lot of
   difficulty or being unable to walk 1/4 mile or climb 10 steps without
   resting. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality.
   Results: There were 608 (31\%) occurrences of incident PSLL and 488
   (25\%) deaths during median follow-up of 9.3 years. After adjustment,
   lower isokinetic work was associated with significantly greater risks of
   PSLL and mortality across the full measured range. Hazard ratios per
   standard deviation lower specific isokinetic work were 1.22 (95\% CI
   1.12, 1.33) for PSLL and 1.21 (95\% CI 1.13, 1.30) for mortality,
   respectively. Lower isometric strength was associated with PSLL, but not
   mortality. Fatigue index was not associated with PSLL or mortality.
   Conclusions: Muscle endurance, estimated by isokinetic work, is an
   indicator of muscle health associated with mobility limitation and
   mortality providing important insight beyond strength testing.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes,
   including adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in
   frailty and is a key consideration in medication choice and dosing;
   however, creatinine-based measures of kidney function may be biased in
   frail individuals.
   Study Design: Observational study.
   Setting \& Participants: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women
   with complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis
   Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013).
   Predictors: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
   estimated using serum creatinine (eGFR(cr)) and serum cystatin C level
   (eGFR(cys)) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio.
   Outcome: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more
   frailty characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness,
   and low physical activity).
   Results: 341 (7\%) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30\%)
   had eGFR(cr), < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 2,480 (50\%) had eGFR(cys), < 60
   mL/min/1.73 m(2), and 1,006 (20\%) had albuminuria with albumin
   excretion >= 30 mg/g. Among frail participants, prevalences of eGFR(cr)
   and eGFR(cys), < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were 45\% and 77\%, respectively.
   Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with
   eGFRcr and a strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine
   ratio. Frail individuals with eGFRcr of 60 to,75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 were
   frequently reclassified to lower eGFR categories using eGFR(cys) (49\%
   to 45-<60, 32\% to 30-<45, and 3\% to<30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)).
   Hyperpolypharmacy (taking >= 10 classes of medications) was more common
   in frail individuals (54\% vs 38\% of nonfrail), including classes
   requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and
   subsequent complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants).
   Limitations: Cross-sectional study design.
   Conclusions: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney
   function, with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was
   classified by eGFR(cys) versus eGFR(cr). Given the substantial
   medication burden and uncertainty in chronic kidney disease
   classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative
   biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in
   this vulnerable population. (C) 2016 by the National Kidney Foundation,

Abstract = {{Management of older people on dialysis requires focus on the wider
   aspects of aging as well as dialysis. Almost all frail and older
   patients receiving dialysis will default to in-center hemodialysis,
   although the availability of assisted peritoneal dialysis enables
   dialysis at home. As with any disease management decision, patients
   approaching end-stage renal disease need all the appropriate facts about
   their prognosis, the natural history of their disease without dialysis,
   and the resulting outcomes and complications of the different dialysis
   modalities. Hemodialysis in the older age group can be complicated by
   intradialytic hypotension, prolonged time to recovery, and vascular
   access-related problems. Peritoneal dialysis can be difficult for older
   patients with impaired physical or cognitive function and can become a
   considerable burden. Use of incremental dialysis, changes in
   hemodialysis frequency, and delivery and use of assistance for
   peritoneal dialysis can ameliorate quality of life for older patients.
   Understanding each individual's goals of care in the context of his or
   her life experience is particularly important in the elderly, when
   overall life expectancy is relatively short, and life experience or
   quality of life may be the priority. Indeed, some patients select the
   option of no dialysis or conservative care. With multifaceted
   assessments of care, physicians should be able to give individual
   patients the ability to select and continue to make the best decisions
   for their care.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In geriatric populations, frailty is associated with poor
   health outcomes, including mortality. Frailty has not been examined in
   lupus, although components of the phenotype seem relevant.
   Methods: Women with lupus (n=152) participated in research visits in
   2008-2009. Frailty was assessed by Fried's frailty phenotype criteria:
   low weight/unintentional weight loss, slow gait (4-m walk using sex and
   height criteria), weakness (grip strength using gender and body mass
   index criteria), exhaustion (2 specific questions) and inactivity (from
   physical activity questionnaire). Women accumulating 3+ components were
   classified as `frail', one or two components as `prefrail', and none as
   `robust'. Physical function (36 item Short Form (SF-36) Physical
   Functioning subscale and Valued Life Activities disability scale),
   cognitive function (from a 12-test battery) and mortality were examined
   as outcomes. Mortality was determined as of December 2015. Multiple
   regression analyses examined concurrent and 2-year function controlling
   for age, lupus duration, race/ethnicity, glucocorticoid use, obesity,
   self-reported disease activity and damage and, for longitudinal
   analyses, baseline function. Mortality analyses controlled for age,
   lupus duration and baseline disease damage scores.
   Results: Mean age was 48 ( 12) years, mean lupus duration was 16 ( 9)
   years. 20\% of the sample was classified as frail and 50\% as prefrail.
   Frail women had significantly worse physical functioning than both
   robust and prefrail women and were more likely to have cognitive
   impairment. Frail women were also more likely to experience declines in
   functioning and onset of cognitive impairment. Mortality rates were
   significantly higher in the frail group (frail 19.4\%; prefrail 3.9\%;
   robust 2.3\%). Odds (95\% CI) of death for frail women were elevated,
   even after adjusting for age, lupus duration and baseline disease damage
   (5.9 (0.6 to 57.1)).
   Conclusions: Prevalence of frailty in this sample of women with lupus
   was higher than in samples of older adults. Frailty was associated with
   poor physical and cognitive function, functional declines and mortality.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Iron overload, diagnosed by means of magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI), is an increasingly recognized disorder in hemodialysis
   patients. Specific MRI protocols have been shown to provide a reliable
   estimation of tissue iron content in non-renal patient populations but
   have not been validated in dialysis patients. Such validation studies
   require liver biopsy for histological comparison, but this invasive and
   risky procedure raises ethical concerns, especially regarding frail
   patients with end-stage renal disease.
   Materials and methods: We compared in a pilot study Scheuer's
   histological classification and Deugnier and Turlin's histological
   classification of iron overload (Perls staining) with
   signal-intensity-ratio MRI values obtained with the Rennes University
   algorithm in 11 hemodialysis patients in whom liver biopsy was formally
   indicated for their medical follow-up.
   Results: For Scheuer's histological classification, the Wilcoxon
   non-parametric matched-pairs test showed no significant difference in
   the ranking of iron overload by the two methods eg histology and MRI
   (sum of ranks = 1.5; p = 1). The MRI and Scheuer's histological
   classifications were tightly correlated (rho = 0.866, p = 0.0035,
   Spearman's coefficient), as were the absolute liver iron concentrations
   (LIC) at MRI (rho = 0.860, p = 0.0013, Spearman's coefficient). The
   absolute liver iron concentrations at MRI were also highly correlated
   with Deugnier and Turlin's histological scoring (rho = 0.841, p =
   0.0033, Spearman's coefficient).
   Conclusions: This pilot study shows that liver iron determination based
   on signal intensity-ratio MRI (Rennes University algorithm) very
   accurately identifies iron load in hemodialysis patients, by comparison

   0.25). In addition, estimated glomerular filtration rate (based on B2M)
   or chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate. 60
   mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was significantly associated with frailty phenotype
   and index.
   Conclusion: B2M was significantly associated with both frailty phenotype
   and index in elderly Chinese population. The findings underscore the
   promising kidney relevant biomarkers for identifying vulnerable elderly
   Chinese population.}},

Abstract = {{The number of elderly patients on maintenance dialysis has rapidly
   increased in the past few decades, particularly in developed countries,
   imposing a growing burden on dialysis centres. Hence, many nephrologists
   and healthcare authorities feel that greater emphasis should be placed
   on the promotion of home dialysis therapies such as peritoneal dialysis
   (PD) and home haemodialysis (HD). There is currently no general
   consensus as to the best dialysis modality for elderly patients with
   end-stage renal disease. In-centre HD is predominant in most countries,
   although it is widely recognized that PD has several advantages over HD,
   including the lack of need for vascular access, continuous slow
   ultrafiltration, less interference with patients' lifestyle and lower
   costs. Comparisons of outcomes between elderly patients on PD and HD
   rely on observational studies, as randomized controlled trials are
   lacking. The results of these studies are variable. However, most of
   them suggest that survival rates are largely similar between the two
   modalities, except for elderly patients with diabetes and/or beyond 1-3
   years from dialysis initiation, in which cases HD appears to be
   superior. An equally important aspect to consider when choosing dialysis
   modality, particularly in this age group, is the quality of life, and in
   this regard most studies found no significant differences between PD and
   HD. In these circumstances, we believe that dialysis modality selection
   should be guided by patient's preference, based on comprehensive and
   unbiased information. A multidisciplinary team should review elderly
   patients starting on dialysis, aiming to identify possible barriers to
   PD and home HD, including physical, visual, cognitive, psychological and
   social problems, and to overcome such barriers by adequate care,
   education, psychological counselling and dialysis assistance.}},

Abstract = {{The health status of older people is frequently complicated by one or
   more chronic diseases. Some conditions might have a different meaning in
   certain groups of elderly subjects, like in frail people or older
   patients with heart failure. Cut-off values defining these conditions
   may require adjustment in such groups. Indeed, several such conditions
   (e.g. obesity and hypercholesterolemia) have been discussed recently in
   light of so-called paradoxical situations, which are -
   counter-intuitively - associated with better outcome instead of a
   negative impact on survival in the general population. Therefore,
   different cut-off values may be needed in some groups of older subjects.
   The pathophysiological mechanisms for these paradoxical situations need
   to be understood in at least two different ways, causal and non-causal.
   The aim of this review is to provide an overview of a variety of
   conditions (obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes) in which
   new cut-offs may have diagnostic, clinical, or prognostic value,
   focusing on heart failure as a chronic disease, which is frequently
   observed in older patients. Haemoglobin concentration may need a
   different cut-off in heart failure for a reason other than paradox.
   Namely, underlying iron deficiency itself, both in those with or without
   anaemia, can have effects on symptoms and quality of life. Further
   studies will be needed for re-defining cut-off values in heart failure
   and maybe in the other chronic illnesses. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Objective: Frailty is associated with increased vulnerability to poor
   health. There is growing interest in understanding the association
   between frailty and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review
   explored how frailty is measured in patients with CKD and the
   association between frailty and adverse outcomes across different stages
   of renal impairment.
   Study design: Systematic analysis of peer reviewed articles.
   Data sources: Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane were used to
   identify the articles.
   Data synthesis: Articles published before the 17th of September 2016,
   that measured frailty in patients with CKD was eligible for the
   systematic review. Two independent researchers assessed the eligibility
   of the articles. Quality of the articles was assessed using the
   Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument.
   Results: The literature search yielded 540 articles, of which 32 met the
   study criteria and were included in the review (n = 36,076, age range:
   50-83 years). Twenty-three (72\%) studies used or adapted the Fried
   phenotype to measure frailty. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 7\%
   in community-dwellers (CKD Stages 1-4) to 73\% in a cohort of patients
   on haemodialysis. The incidence of frailty increased with reduced
   glomerular filtration rate. Frailty was associated with an increased
   risk of mortality and hospitalization.
   Conclusion: Frailty is prevalent in patients with CKD and it is
   associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. There are
   differences in the methods used to assess frailty and this hinders
   comparisons between studies. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Purpose of reviewMany frailty screening instruments have been proposed
   due to the lack of consensus on a unified operational definition of
   frailty. This review reports on recent frailty screening tools in
   addition to revisiting the frailty concept.Recent findingsAlthough there
   are two representative frailty models, both have issues that prevent
   them from being implemented in clinical settings despite their
   remarkable advantages. Due to their different characteristics, these
   models are thought to be complementary rather than substitutive. The
   recent introduction of frailty identification into primary care and
   specific clinical settings has led to both a focus on its importance and
   the development of new screening methods.SummaryThe phenotype model is
   rather faithfully based on biological change with aging, while the
   deficit model comprehensively captures risk of disability. Most of the
   current frailty screening tools are based on these models. Screening
   tools based on the former model primarily capture declines in physical
   functions, whereas screening tools based on the latter model involve
   questionnaires that examine functional impairments in multiple domains.
   Implementation of a model in a clinical setting depends on both the
   model characteristics and the clinical settings.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent
   chronic condition with a dramatic impact on the health status that is
   evident even in milder stages of the disease. However, deaths due to
   respiratory causes account for only a fraction of mortality in COPD.
   Thus, comorbid conditions as potential co-determinants of the effects of
   COPD on both health status and survival have received much attention in
   the last years. COPD is almost invariably associated with other
   diseases, and three mechanisms most likely underpin this association.
   First, COPD is an age-related diseases, and as such tend to be
   associated with other age-related diseases. Second, COPD shares its most
   important risk factor-cigarette smoking-with several other diseases, in
   particular cardiovascular diseases. Third, COPD, or COPD treatment, may
   impact other systems or organs, as is the case of COPD-associated anemia
   or osteoporosis. The aim of this article is to provide an overview on
   the comorbidities of COPD that are most relevant for the elderly,
   providing information relevant for patients' management. COPD is a
   highly prevalent chronic condition, the only one whose prevalence is
   steadily rising in western countries (1). Currently the sixth, it is
   expected to rank the third cause of death by 2020 (2). Furthermore, it
   dramatically impacts the health status and the personal independence
   (3). However, deaths due to respiratory causes account for only a
   fraction of mortality in COPD (4), whereas health status is frequently
   impaired even in the milder stages of the disease (5). This fact has

   Methods. Retrospective, cross-sectional, descriptive study in patients
   admitted and diagnosed with influenza by molecular biology in the
   General University Hospital of Alicante from 1 January to 31 April 2015.
   Results. A total of 219 patients were diagnosed with influenza in the

Abstract = {{With the wider availability of antiretrovirals, the world's HIV
   population is aging. More than 10\% of the 34.5 million HIV-positive
   individuals worldwide are over the age of 50 years and the average age
   continues to increase. In the USA more than 50\% of the 1.3 million
   people with HIV are over 50 years old and by the year 2030 it is
   estimated that 70\% will be over the age of 50 years. Although the life
   expectancy of HIV-positive people has increased dramatically, it still
   lags behind that of HIV-negative individuals. There is controversy about
   whether HIV itself accelerates the aging process. Elevated rates of
   inflammation seen in people with HIV, even if their viral loads are
   suppressed and their CD4 counts are preserved, are associated with
   greater rates of cardiovascular, renal, neurocognitive, oncological, and
   osteoporotic disease. These conditions increase exponentially in the
   elderly and will represent a major challenge for HIV patients. In
   addition, conditions such as geriatric syndromes including frailty are
   also seen at higher rates. Management of the aging HIV patient includes
   an emphasis on early diagnosis and treatment, preventative measures for
   co-morbidities, and avoiding polypharmacy. Finally, the issue of quality
   of life, prioritization of medical issues, and end of life care become

Abstract = {{Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3-5 now affects 8.5\% of adults in

   Increasing numbers of older patients are contributing to the growth of
   demand of kidney services. With the exception of transplantation,
   dialysis has been the main form of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for
   advanced CKD. This elderly population is usually too frail and has many
   other co-existing medical complaints or co morbidities to undergo
   transplantation. Dialysis is an invasive treatment, and some frail
   elderly patients can experience many dialysis related symptoms. An
   alternative option for these patients is to choose conservative
   management (CM) of their stage 5 CKD. These patients often have complex
   supportive and palliative care needs. The frequency, severity and
   distress caused by symptoms related to stage 5 CKD are often under
   recognized and under treated. There is a need for early identification
   and management of symptoms as they present in patients with stage 5 CKD
   being managed conservatively. Symptom assessment should be focused on
   anticipating, identifying and alleviating any symptoms. This needs to be
   incorporated into the regular practice of those managing CM patients.}},

Abstract = {{Metformin (MF) accumulation during acute kidney injury is associated
   with high anion gap lactic acidosis type B (MF-associated lactic
   acidosis, MALA), a serious medical condition leading to high mortality.
   Despite dose adjustment for renal failure, diabetic patients with
   chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III-IV are at risk for rapid decline
   in renal function by whatever reason, so that MF toxicity might arise if
   the drug is not timely withdrawn. Sixteen consecutive patients were
   admitted to our Hospital's Emergency Department with clinical findings
   consistent with MALA. Fifteen had prior history of CKD, 60 \% of them
   with GFR between 30 and 60 ml/min. Of these, 5 required mechanical
   ventilation and cardiovascular support; 3 promptly recovered renal
   function after rehydration, whereas 10 (62 \%) required continuous
   veno-venous renal replacement treatment. SOFA and SAPS II scores were
   significantly related to the degree of lactic acidosis. In addition,
   lactate levels were relevant to therapeutic choices, since they were
   higher in dialyzed patients than in those on conservative treatment
   (11.92 mmol/l vs 5.7 mmol/l, p = 0.03). The overall death rate has been
   31 \%, with poorer prognosis for worse acidemia, as serum pH was
   significantly lower in non-survivors (pH 6.96 vs 7.16, p > 0.04). Our
   own data and a review of the literature suggest that aged,
   hemodynamically frail patients, with several comorbidities and CKD, are
   at greater risk of MALA, despite MF dosage adjustment. Moreover, renal
   replacement therapy rather than simple acidosis correction by

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus (HCV) mainly targets the liver but can also induce
   extrahepatic manifestations. The kidney may be impacted via an immune
   mediated mechanism or a cytopathic effect. HCV patients are clearly at a
   greater risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) than uninfected patients
   are, and the presence of CKD increases mortality. Interferon-based
   therapies and ribavirin are difficult to manage and are poorly effective
   in end-stage renal disease and hemodialysis. These patients should be
   given priority treatment with new direct anti-viral agents (DAAs) while
   avoiding peginterferon and ribavirin. The first results were convincing.
   To aid in the correct use of these drugs in patients with renal
   insufficiency, their pharmacokinetic properties and potential renal
   toxicity must be known. The renal toxicity of these new drugs was not a
   safety signal in clinical trials, and the drugs are generally efficient
   in these frail populations. These drugs are usually well tolerated, but
   recent cohort studies have demonstrated that these new regimens may be
   associated with renal side effects, especially when using sofosbuvir
   combinations. HCV, renal diseases and comorbidities are intimately
   linked. The close monitoring of renal function is required, particularly
   for at-risk patients (transplanted, HIV-coinfected, CKD, hypertensive or
   diabetic patients). New DAA regimens, which will soon be approved, will
   probably change the landscape.}},

Title = {{Health-Related Quality of Life Impacts Mortality but Not Progression to
   End-Stage Renal Disease in Pre-Dialysis Chronic Kidney Disease: A
   Prospective Observational Study}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with reduced health-related
   quality of life (HRQL). However, the relationship between pre-dialysis
   CKD, HRQL and clinical outcomes, including mortality and progression to
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is unclear.
   Methods
   All 745 participants recruited into the Renal Impairment In Secondary
   Care study to end March 2014 were included. Demographic, clinical and
   laboratory data were collected at baseline including an assessment of
   HRQL using the Euroqol EQ-5D-3L. Health states were converted into an
   EQ-5D(index) score using a set of weighted preferences specific to the
   UK population. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression and
   competing risk analyses were undertaken to evaluate the association of
   HRQL with progression to ESRD or all cause mortality. Regression
   analyses were then performed to identify variables associated with the
   significant HRQL components.
   Results
   Median eGFR was 25.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (IQR 19.6-33.7ml/min) and median
   ACR was 33 mg/mmol (IQR 6.6-130.3 mg/mmol). Five hundred and fifty five
   participants (75.7\%) reported problems with one or more EQ-5D domains.
   When adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity, eGFR and ACR, both reported
   problems with self-care {[}hazard ratio 2.542, 95\% confidence interval
   1.222-5.286, p = 0.013] and reduced EQ-5D(index) score {[}hazard ratio
   0.283, 95\% confidence interval 0.099-0.810, p = 0.019] were
   significantly associated with an increase in all-cause mortality.
   Similar findings were observed for competing risk analyses. Reduced HRQL
   was not a risk factor for progression to ESRD in multivariable analyses.
   Conclusions
   Impaired HRQL is common in the pre-dialysis CKD population. Reduced
   HRQL, as demonstrated by problems with self-care or a lower EQ-5D(index)
   score, is associated with a higher risk for death but not ESRD. Multiple
   factors influence these aspects of HRQL but renal function, as measured
   by eGFR and ACR, are not among them.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic acidosis is common in advanced chronic kidney disease and has
   been associated with a range of physiological derangements of importance
   to the health of older people. These include associations with skeletal
   muscle weakness, cardiovascular risk factors, and bone and mineral
   disorders that may lead to fragility fractures. Although metabolic
   acidosis is associated with accelerated decline in kidney function,
   end-stage renal failure is a much less common outcome in older, frail
   patients than cardiovascular death. Correction of metabolic acidosis
   using bicarbonate therapy is commonly employed, but the existing
   evidence is insufficient to know whether such therapy is of net benefit
   to older people. Bicarbonate is bulky and awkward to take, may impose
   additional sodium load with effects on fluid retention and blood
   pressure, and may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Trial data to
   date suggest potential benefits of bicarbonate therapy on progression of
   renal disease and nutrition, but trials have not as yet been published
   examining the effect of bicarbonate therapy across a range of domains
   relevant to the health of older people. Fortunately, a number of trials
   are now underway that should allow us to ascertain whether bicarbonate
   therapy can improve physical function, quality of life, and vascular,
   bone and kidney health in older people, and hence decide whether any
   benefits seen outweigh adverse effects and additional treatment burden
   in this vulnerable group of patients.}},

Abstract = {{The scope of this article is to identify sociodemographic and clinical
   factors associated with the frailty of elderly people with chronic

   Characterization Instrument was used for extracting sociodemographic and
   clinical data and the Edmonton Frail Scale was used to evaluate the
   level of frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify
   the factors associated with frailty. The mean age of the 60 patients
   included was 71.1 (+/- 6.9) years, predominantly male (70\%), of which
   36.7\% were classified as frail. With respect to the factors associated
   with frailty among the variables of gender, age, self-reported skin
   color, schooling, monthly per capita income, hemodialysis time, number
   of associated diseases, falls in the year, hematocrit level, parathyroid
   hormone and use of calcitriol, it was found that only the monthly per
   capita income was significantly associated with frailty (OR = 0.44; 95\%

   income, showing that the elderly most at risk of frailty were those with
   lower income.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated
   with increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve
   replacement, its impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic
   valve replacement (TAVR) is less defined.
   Methods. TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter
   Valves) trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using
   the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included.
   Patients were divided into three groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD),
   GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR <= 30 mL/min (severe RD).
   Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Cox
   regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors of
   1-year all-cause mortality.
   Results. A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from
   the PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR
   level: 767 (30\%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58\%) had
   moderate RD, and 291 (12\%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society
   of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk Mortality for the cohort was 11.5\%,
   and it was highest in those with severe RD (13.8\%). Patients with
   severe RD were more often women with a higher prevalence of diabetes.
   Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of 30-day and 1-year
   all-cause mortality and ADULT CARDIAC rehospitalization. The 30-day rate
   of death from any cause was 10.7\% in the severe RD group versus 6.0\%
   in the moderate and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death
   from any cause was 34.4\% in the severe RD group versus 21.5\% in the
   moderate RD and 20.8\% in the none/mild RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio
   {[}HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p
   = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other significant predictors of
   1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass index, frailty, the
   transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction, oxygen-dependent
   chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male sex.
   Conclusions. Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for
   1-year mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the
   heart team is required in patients with severe preprocedural RD. (C)

Abstract = {{Older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience
   functional impairment that can complicate CKD management. Failure to
   recognize functional impairment may put these individuals at risk of
   further functional decline, nursing home placement, and missed
   opportunities for timely goals-of-care conversations. Routine geriatric
   assessment could be a useful tool for identifying older adults with CKD
   who are at risk of functional decline and provide contextual information
   to guide clinical decision-making. Two innovative programs were
   implemented in the Veterans Health Administration that incorporate
   geriatric assessment into a nephrology visit. In one program, a
   geriatrician embedded in a nephrology clinic used standardized geriatric
   assessment tools with individuals with CKD aged 70 and older
   (Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment for CKD) (CGA-4-CKD). In the second
   program, a nephrology clinic used comprehensive appointments for
   individuals aged 75 and older to conduct geriatric assessments and CKD
   care (Renal Silver). Data on 68 veterans who had geriatric assessments
   through these programs between November 2013 and May 2015 are reported.
   In CGA-4-CKD, difficulty with one or more activities of daily living
   (ADLs), history of falls, and cognitive impairment were each found in
   27.3\% of participants. ADL difficulty was found in 65.7\%, falls in
   28.6\%, and cognitive impairment in 51.6\% of participants in Renal
   Silver. Geriatric assessment guided care processes in 45.4\% (n = 15) of
   veterans in the CGA-4-CKD program and 37.1\% (n = 13) of those in Renal
   Silver. Findings suggest there is a significant burden of functional

Abstract = {{Aims: To describe the characteristics and associated risk factors of
   patients with established diabetes who required Emergency Department
   (ED) care for severe hypoglycemia.
   Methods: We performed an observational retrospective study to identify
   all cases of severe hypoglycemia among attendees at the EDs of three
   Italian University hospitals from January 2010 to December 2014.
   Results: Overall, 520 patients with established diabetes were
   identified. Mean out-of-hospital blood glucose concentrations at the
   time of the hypoglycemic event were 2.2 +/- 1.3 mmol/L. Most of these
   patients were frail and had multiple comorbidities. They were treated
   with oral hypoglycemic drugs (43.6\%), insulin (42.8\%), or both
   (13.6\%). Among the oral hypoglycemic drugs, glibenclamide (54.5\%) and
   repaglinide (25.7\%) were the two most frequently used drugs, followed
   by glimepiride (11.3\%) and gliclazide (7.5\%). Hospitalization rates
   and in-hospital deaths occurred in 35.4\% and in 2.3\% of patients,
   respectively. Cirrhosis (odds ratio {[}OR] 6.76, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 1.24-36.8, p < 0.05), chronic kidney disease (OR 2.42,

   Conclusions: Severe hypoglycemia is a remarkable burden for patients

   outcomes (in-hospital death and hospitalization), mainly in elderly and

Abstract = {{Background Cachexia describes a complex pathological syndrome of muscle
   wasting, anorexia and weight loss. Progesterone therapies have been
   shown to improve appetite and promote weight gain in patients with
   cachexia; however, research has focused heavily on patients with cancer,
   and its effectiveness in other diseases remains unclear.
   Aims This systematic review aimed to present the evidence available for
   progesterone therapy as a treatment for non-cancer cachexia.
   Method Surrogate outcome measures used were weight change, lean body
   mass (LBM), muscle strength, appetite, health-related quality of life
   (HRQOL) and serum albumin. Both randomised and non-randomised trials
   were included. A literature search of clinical trials using the medical
   subject heading (MeSH) terms `cachexia' OR `anorexia' OR `weight' OR
   `frail (truncated)' OR `appetite' OR `wasting syndrome' PLUS `megestrol
   acetate' OR `medroxyprogesterone acetate' was performed.
   Results Eighteen studies were included in this review; 12 randomised
   control trials and 6 non-randomised trials. This collated results from
   916 patients with HIV/AIDS, end-stage renal failure, chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD) and geriatric cachexia. Meta-analysis comparing
   progesterone therapy with placebo concluded mean change in weight was
   not significant (mean difference (MD) 1.56, 95\% CI -0.36 to 3.52,
   p=0.12). There was little evidence to show significant impact on LBM,
   and no trials looked at muscle strength. There was a paucity of evidence
   looking at appetite and HRQOL; however, results were generally positive.
   Conclusions Current evidence does not support the use of progesterone
   therapies for non-cancer cachexia. There may however be a limited role
   for its use as an appetite stimulant in a palliative context on a
   case-by-case basis.}},

Abstract = {{Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequent in patients with
   cardiovascular (CV) disease and impacts prognosis in these subjects.
   While current guidelines recommend the CKD-EPI equation for the
   estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and recognizing CKD, a new
   creatinine-based equation - the Berlin Initiative Study-1 (BIS-1) - was
   generated for elders with a high prevalence of CV disease. We assessed
   whether BIS-1 provided more accurate risk stratification than the
   CKD-EPI equation in unselected aged patients with CV disease.
   Methods Patients aged 70 years who were seen consecutively at the
   Cardiovascular Centre of Trieste (Italy) between November 2009 and
   October 2013 were recruited into this study. The correlation and
   agreement between the BIS-1 and CKD-EPI formulas were evaluated and
   intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were computed in order to
   estimate the correlation between the two formulas. Patients were
   followed for all-cause death, composite outcomes of all-cause
   death/all-cause hospitalization and all-cause death/CV hospitalization.
   Results A total of 7845 subjects met the inclusion criteria for this
   study. GFR as estimated with the BIS-1 and the CKD-EPI equation was
   highly correlated (ICC: 0.81; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]:
   0.79-0.82; p<0.0001). When allocating patients in Kidney Disease
   Improving Global Outcomes classes of eGFR, compared to CKD-EPI, the
   BIS-1 formula reclassified 2720 (34.7\%) patients: 53 (1.9\%) were
   placed in a better class and 2667 (98.1\%) were placed in a worse class.
   Multivariable Cox models showed that BIS-1 compared to CKD-EPI had a
   significantly better accuracy for predicting death (NRI: 0.12; 95\% CI:
   0.03-0.19; p=0.001), death/CV hospitalization (net reclassification
   improvement {[}NRI]: 0.34; 95\% CI: 0.27-0.38; p<0.001) and
   death/all-cause hospitalization (NRI: 0.14; 95\% CI: 0.06-0.21;

   Conclusions The BIS-1 formula is better than the CKD-EPI formula for
   risk stratification of CKD in elderly people with CV disease.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Anticoagulation is often avoided in patients with atrial
   fibrillation who are at an increased risk of falling.
   OBJECTIVES This study assessed the relative efficacy and safety of
   edoxaban versus warfarin in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective
   Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial
   Fibrillation-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) trial in patients
   with atrial fibrillation judged to be at increased risk of falling.
   METHODS We performed a pre-specified analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48,
   comparing patients with versus without increased risk of falling.
   RESULTS Nine hundred patients (4.3\%) were judged to be at increased
   risk of falling. These patients were older (median, 77 vs. 72 years; p <
   0.001), and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities including prior
   stroke/transient ischemic attack, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.
   After multivariable adjustment, patients at increased risk of falling
   experienced more bone fractures caused by falling (adjusted hazard ratio
   {[}HRadj]: 1.88; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.49 to 2.38; p <
   0.001), major bleeding (HRadj: 1.30; 95\% CI: 1.04 to 1.64; p = 0.023),
   life-threatening bleeding (HRadj: 1.67; 95\% CI: 1.11 to 2.50; p =
   0.013), and all-cause death (HRadj: 1.45; 95\% CI: 1.23 to 1.70; p <
   0.001), but not ischemic events including stroke/systemic embolic event
   (HRadj: 1.16; 95\% CI: 0.89 to 1.51; p = 0.27). No treatment interaction
   was observed between either dosing regimens of edoxaban and warfarin for
   the efficacy and safety outcomes. Treatment with edoxaban resulted in a
   greater absolute risk reduction in severe bleeding events and all-cause
   mortality compared with warfarin.
   CONCLUSIONS Edoxaban is an attractive alternative to warfarin in
   patients at increased risk of falling, because it is associated with an
   even greater absolute reduction in severe bleeding events and mortality.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate for the first time the longitudinal relationship
   between serumuric acid concentrations and risk of frailty.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study of 2198 non-institutionalized
   individuals aged >= 60 years recruited in 2008-2010. At baseline,
   information was obtained on socio-demographic factors, health behaviors
   and morbidity, while serum uric acid was determined in 12-h fasting
   blood samples. Study participants were followed-up through 2012 to
   assess incident frailty, defined as >= 2 of the following 4 Fried
   criteria: exhaustion, muscle weakness, low physical activity, and slow
   walking speed.
   Results: During amean 3.5-year follow-up, 256 cases of incident frailty
   were identified. After multivariate adjustment, the odds ratios (95\%
   confidence interval) of frailty comparing the second and third tertiles
   of uric acid to the lowest tertile were, respectively: 1.18 (0.83-1.68)
   and 1.57 (1.11-2.22); p-linear trend = 0.01. The corresponding result
   for a 1mg/dL increase in serumuric acid concentration was 1.12
   (1.00-1.24). Similar associations were observed across subgroups defined
   by sex, age, body mass index, and physical activity. As regards each
   frailty component, the odds ratios (95\% confidence interval) per 1
   mg/dL increase in serumuric acid were 1.10 (0.99-1.23) for low physical
   activity, 1.08 (0.95-1.23) for low walking speed, 1.08 (0.67-1.73) for
   exhaustion and 0.91 (0.81-1.02) for weakness.
   Conclusions: Serum uric acid concentrations are positively associated
   with the risk of frailty in older adults. Further studies are needed to
   evaluate whether specific dietary recommendations or pharmacological
   strategies aimed at lowering serum uric acid would be beneficial to
   prevent the development of this syndrome. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Background: Patient-centered quality outcomes such as disposition after
   surgery are increasingly being scrutinized. Preoperative factors
   predictive of nonhome discharge (DC) may identify at-risk patients for
   targeted interventions. This study examines the association among
   preoperative risk factors, frailty, and nonhome DC after elective
   vascular surgery procedures in patients living at home.
   Methods: The 2011-2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project
   database was queried to identify all home-dwelling patients who
   underwent elective vascular procedures (endovascular and open aortic
   aneurysm repair, suprainguinal and infrainguinal bypasses, peripheral
   endovascular interventions, carotid endarterectomy, and stent).
   Preoperative frailty was measured using the modified frailty index (mFl;
   derived from Canadian Study of Health and Aging). Univariate and
   multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the
   association of frailty and nonhome DC.
   Results: Of 15,843 home-dwelling patients, 1,177 patients (7.4\%) did
   not return home postoperatively. Frailty (mFI > 0.25) conferred a
   significantly increased 2-fold risk of nonhome DC disposition for each
   procedure type. Frailty, female gender, open procedures, increasing age,
   end-stage renal disease, and occurrence of any postoperative
   complication were associated with increased risk of nonhome DC. On
   multivariate logistic regression analysis, frailty increased the odds of
   nonhome DC by 60\% (odds ratio 1.6, 95\% confidence interval 1.4-1.8)
   after adjusting for other covariates. In the presence of complications,
   the risk of nonhome DC was 27.5\% in frail versus 16.5\% in nonfrail
   patients (P< 0.001). In the absence of complications, although absolute
   risk was lower, frail patients were nearly twice as likely to not return
   home (frail 5.5\% vs. nonfrail 2.75\%, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Frail home-dwelling patients undergoing elective vascular
   procedures are at high risk of not returning home after surgery.
   Preoperative frailty assessment appears to hold potential for counseling
   regarding postsurgery disposition and DC planning.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Prognosis of the increasing number of elderly patients with
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is poor with high risk of functional
   decline and mortality. Frailty seems to be a good predictor for those
   patients that will not benefit from dialysis. Varying prevalences
   between populations are probably related to the instrument used. The aim
   of this study was to measure the prevalence of frailty among ESRD
   patients with two different validated instruments.
   Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients, aged >=
   18 years, receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis
   care between September 2013 and December 2013 in a single dialysis
   center in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. Frailty was measured with the
   frailty index (FI) and frailty phenotype (FP).
   Results Prevalence of frailty by the FI was 36.8 \% among 95
   participants with ESRD (age: 65.2 years, SD +/- 12.0). Frailty
   prevalence among participants aged >= 65 and < 65 years was 43.6 and
   27.5 \%, respectively. Female sex {[}odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95 \%
   confidence interval (CI) 1.3-8.0] and a Charlson comorbidity index score
   of >= 5 (OR 2.6, 95 \% CI 1.0-6.6) were associated with frailty. The FI
   identified different but overlapping participants as frail compared with
   the FP; 62.5 \% of frail participants according to FI were also frail
   according to the FP.
   Conclusions Prevalence of frailty among young and elderly ESRD patients
   is high; being female and having more comorbidity was associated with
   frailty. Use of a broader definition of frailty, like the FI, gives a
   higher estimation of prevalence among ESRD patients compared with a
   physical frailty assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Hypertension is very common in elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes.
   The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes can be devastating to the
   cardiovascular system, and in these patients, tight blood pressure (BP)
   control is particularly beneficial. Little information is available
   regarding the target BP levels in elderly hypertensive patients with
   type 2 diabetes, and therefore extrapolation from data in the general
   population should be done. However, it is difficult to extrapolate from
   the general population to these frail individuals, who usually have
   isolated systolic hypertension, comorbidities, organ damage,
   cardiovascular disease, and renal failure and have a high rate of
   orthostatic and postprandial hypotension. On the basis of the available
   evidence, we provide arguments supporting the individualized approach in
   these patients. Target BP should be based on concomitant diseases,
   orthostatic BP changes, and the general condition of the patients. It is
   recommended to lower BP in the elderly patient with diabetes to
   <140-150/90 mmHg, providing the patient is in good condition. In
   patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the same target is
   reasonable providing the diastolic BP is >60 mmHg. In patients with
   coronary artery disease and in patients with orthostatic hypotension,
   excessive BP lowering should be avoided. In elderly hypertensive
   patients with diabetes, BP levels should be monitored closely in the
   sitting and the standing position, and the treatment should be tailored
   to prevent excessive fall in BP.}},

Month = {{JUL 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Increasing the weekly frequency of hemodialysis sessions has
   positive effects, on the control of several biological data of patients.
   However, knowledge about Daily HemoDialysis (DHD) practices is limited
   in France. The aim of the present study was to describe the
   characteristics and treatment trajectories of all French patients
   undergoing DHD.
   Methods: All patients older than 18 years who started DHD between 2003
   and 2012 in France were included and followed until December 31, 2013.
   The patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment
   modalities were extracted from the French Renal Epidemiological and
   Information Network (REIN) registry.
   Results: During the inclusion period, 753 patients started DHD in
   France. Based on their median age (64 years), patients were classified
   in two groups: ``old{''} group (>= 64 years) and ``young{''} group (<64
   years). Patients in the old group had more comorbidities than in the
   young group: 48 \% had diabetes (vs 29 \% in the young group), 17 \% an
   active malignancy (vs 10 \%) and 80 \% >= 1 cardiovascular disease (vs
   41 \%). Concerning patients' treatment trajectories, 496 (66 \%)
   patients started with another dialysis before switching to DHD and 257
   (34 \%) directly with DHD. At the end of the follow-up, 69 \% of
   patients in the old group were dead (27.4 \% in the young group) and
   kidney transplantation was more frequent in the young group (30.4 \% vs
   0.5 \%).
   Conclusion: In France, DHD is proposed not only to young in rather good
   clinical conditions and waiting for kidney transplantation, but also to
   old and frail patients with higher mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has spawned the evolution
   of novel catheter-based therapies for a variety of cardiovascular
   conditions. Newer device iterations are delivering lower peri-and early
   post-procedural complication rates in patients with aortic stenosis, who
   were otherwise deemed too high risk for conventional surgical valve
   replacement. Yet beyond the post-procedural period, a considerable
   portion of current TAVI recipients fail to derive a benefit from TAVI,
   either dying or displaying a lack of clinical and functional
   improvement. Considerable interest now lies in better identifying
   factors likely to predict futility post-TAVI. Implicit in this are the
   critical roles of frailty, disability, and a multimorbidity patient
   assessment. In this review, we outline the roles that a variety of
   medical comorbidities play in determining futile post-TAVI outcomes,
   including the critical role of frailty underlying the identification of
   patients unlikely to benefit from TAVI. We discuss various TAVI risk
   scores, and further propose that by combining such scores along with
   frailty parameters and the presence of specific organ failure, a more
   accurate and holistic assessment of potential TAVI-related futility

Abstract = {{Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic
   phenotype and predisposes this vulnerable patient population to
   increased risk of comorbid complications, poor quality of life, frailty
   and premature death. The old age of dialysis patients is in addition a
   likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As recent evidence suggests
   that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a better predictor
   of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new screening,
   assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment
   strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training
   are increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and
   should be promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients.
   Testosterone and growth hormone replacement appear as the most promising
   among emerging treatments strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of
   muscle wasting is difficult and seldom successful in this often old,
   frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant patient group, novel treatment
   strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we summarize recent
   studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic stem
   (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
   members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to

   Patients admitted to CHD in the East Metropolitan Health Service of
   Santiago in a 2-year period were analyzed. Four age groups were created,
   separating patients older than 70 years in a special group. Results:
   During the study period, 459 patients were admitted to CHD and were
   followed for an average of 27 months. The frequency of cardiovascular
   comorbidity, cancer, and chronic renal disease of unknown cause
   (attributed to nephrosclerosis) increased along with age. Mortality was
   higher at older ages. There was a significant association between
   starting CHD with a catheter, Charlson comorbidity index and increasing
   age with mortality. For those aged over 80 years, mortality at three
   months and one year was 25 and 43\% respectively. Conclusions: Age,
   Charlson index and vascular access are predictors of mortality in older

   and heart failure in older people with ID. Furthermore, the predictive
   value of cardiovascular disease risk factors on myocardial accident,
   stroke and heart failure and on all-cause mortality were studied. The
   baseline group consisted of the 1050 participants, aged 50 years and
   over, in the Dutch Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disability (HA-ID)
   study. Baseline measurements were conducted between November 2008 and
   July 2010. Three years after baseline, medical files of 790 participants
   were studied.
   Results: Cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke and heart
   failure) occurred in 5.9\% of the population during 3 year follow-up,
   and 32\% of them died due to the condition. Incidence of myocardial
   infarction is 2.8 per 1000 personyears, for stroke 3.2 per 1000
   personyears and for heart failure 12.5 per 1000 personyears. Incidence
   of these conditions is probably underestimated, due to atypical symptom
   presentation. The use of atypical antipsychotics and a history of heart
   failure were predictive for myocardial infarction. Heart failure was
   predicted by abdominal obesity, chronic kidney disease and a history of
   heart failure. A total of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction,
   stroke or heart failure) was predicted by abdominal obesity, a history
   of stroke and a history of heart failure. A low body-mass index,
   peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease and inflammation
   were predictive for 3-year all-cause mortality.
   Conclusion: Incidence of cardiovascular disease in older people with ID
   is similar to that in the general population. A pro-active assessment
   and treatment of the presented cardiovascular disease risk factors may
   reduce cardiovascular disease and mortality in older people with ID. (C)

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Hypertension is the most important treatable
   risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes. Many patients with CKD are
   elderly, but the ideal BP in these individuals is unknown.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements From among 339,887
   patients with incident eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, we examined
   associations of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) with all -cause
   mortality, incident coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic strokes, and
   ESRD from the time of developing CKD until the end of follow-up (July
   26, 2013, for mortality, CHD, and stroke, and December 31, 2011, for
   ESRD) in multivariableadjusted survival models categorized by patients'
   age.
   Results Of the total cohort, 300,424 (88\%) had complete data for
   multivariable analysis. Both SBP and DBP showed a U-shaped association
   with mortality. SBP displayed a linear association with CHD, stroke, and
   ESRD, whereas DBP showed no consistent association with either. SBP>140
   mmHg was associated with higher incidence of all examined outcomes, but
   with an incremental attenuation of the observed risk in older compared
   with younger patients (P<0.05 for interaction) The adjusted hazard
   ratios and 95\% confidence intervals associated with SBP170 mmHg
   (compared with 130-139 mmHg) in patients <50, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and
   >80 years were 1.95 (1.34 to 2.84), 2.01 (1.75 to 2.30), 1.68 (1.49 to
   1.89), 1.39 (1.25 to 1.54), and 1.30 (1.17 to 1.44), respectively. The
   risk of incident CHD, stroke, and ESRD was incrementally higher with
   higher SBP in patients aged <80 years but showed no consistent
   association in those aged >80 years (P<0.05 for interaction for all
   outcomes).
   Conclusions In veterans with incident CKD, SBP showed different
   associations in older versus younger patients. The association of higher
   SBP with adverse outcomes was present but markedly reduced in older
   individuals, especially in those aged >80 years. Elevated DBP showed no
   consistent association with vascular outcomes in patients with incident
   CKD.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The number of elderly patients with advanced chronic
   kidney disease (ACKD) has increased in recent years, and the best
   therapeutic approach has not been determined due to a lack of evidence.
   Objectives: To observe the progression of elderly patients with ACKD
   (stages 4 and 5) and to compare the survival of stage 5 CKD patients
   with and without dialysis treatment.
   Material and methods: All patients >= 70 years who began ACKD follow-up
   from 01/01/2007 to 31/12/2008 were included, and their progression was
   observed until 31/12/2013. Demographic data, the Charlson comorbidity
   index, history of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and diabetes mellitus
   (DM) were assessed.
   Results: A total of 314 patients >= 70 years with stages 4 and 5 CKD
   were studied. Of these patients, 162 patients had stage 5 CKD at the
   beginning of follow-up or progressed to stage 5 during the study, and 69
   of these patients were treated with dialysis. In the stage 5 group:
   median age was 77 years (74-81); 48\% had IHD; 50\% had DM, Charlson 7
   (6-9). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis: >= 70 years (93 vs. 69 patients
   with dialysis, log rank: 15 P<.001); patients >= 75 years (74 vs. 46
   patients with dialysis, log rank: 8.9 P=.003); patients >= 80 (40 vs. 15
   patients with dialysis) and p=0,2. Patients receiving dialysis were
   younger, with a lower Charlson comorbidity index and shorter follow-up
   time.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that dialysis treatment improves survival,
   although this benefit is lost in patients >= 80 years. (C) 2016 Sociedad

Abstract = {{Consequences of aging are gaining clinical relevance. In
   transplantation, aging and immunosenescence impact treatment and
   outcomes. The impact of aging, however, will critically depend on
   distinguishing healthy, chronological aging from biological aging that
   may result into frailty. Approximately 15\% of individuals older than 65
   years are frail, and it is expected that this condition will gain more
   clinical relevance with an expected increase to greater than 20\% over
   the next 5 years. Clearly, frailty impacts various general aspects of
   health care and organ transplantation in particular including patient
   selection, waitlist management and treatment after transplantation. In
   general, frailty has been characterized by a compromised physiological
   reserve and an augmented vulnerability. In comparison to healthy aging,
   inflammatory markers and cytokines are increased in frail older adults.
   Thus, modifications of the immune response, in addition to physical
   limitations and changes of metabolism, are likely to impact outcomes
   after transplantation. Here, we provide a risk assessment of frailty at
   the time of transplant evaluation and review effects on outcomes and
   recovery after transplantation. Moreover, we summarize our current
   understanding of the pathophysiology of frailty and consequences on
   immune responses and metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of complexity, which is an
   essential condition for making the organism capable of keeping
   homeostasis. Thus, senile loss of complexity makes old individuals
   frail: a syndrome characterized by the presence of shrinking
   (sarcopenia), weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness, and low
   physical activity. Moreover, renal ageing progressively leads to a
   glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction, one of the main
   pharmacokinetic senile changes, which is not detectable by simply
   evaluating serum urea or creatinine values but measuring or calculating
   patient's GFR. Finally, current epidemiology has documented that
   detrimental social-behavioral factors such as low education level, poor
   financial-resource, depression, and isolation, also influence the onset
   and progression of chronic diseases, and even overall mortality,
   particularly in the elderly. Thus, we propose that these 3 variables:
   frailty phenotype, senile GFR, and detrimental social-behavioral
   factors, should be considered at time of prescribing drugs or medical
   procedures in the elderly. Additionally, they should also be considered
   for following patient's response to prescribed therapies in elderly
   patients suffering from chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, chronic
   kidney disease, etc.), or on organ replacement treatments (dialysis and
   transplantation).}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Frailty is common among patients on dialysis
   and increases vulnerability to dependency and death.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements We examined the
   predictive ability of frailty on the basis of physical performance and
   self-reported function in participants of a US Renal Data System special
   study that enrolled a convenience sample of 771 prevalent patients on
   hemodialysis from 14 facilities in the Atlanta and northern California
   areas from 2009 to 2011. Performance-based frailty was assessed using
   direct measures of grip strength (weakness) and gait speed along with
   weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity; poor self reported
   function was substituted for weakness and slow gait speed in the self
   reported function based definition. For both definitions, patients
   meeting three or more criteria were considered frail.
   Results The mean age of 762 patients included in analyses was 57.1 +/-
   14.2 years old; 240 patients (31\%) met the physical performance-based
   definition of frailty, and 396 (52\%) met the self reported
   function-based definition. There were 106 deaths during 1.7
   (interquartile range, 1.4-2.4) years of follow-up. After adjusting for
   demographic and clinical characteristics, the hazard ratio (HR) for
   mortality for the performance-based definition (2.16; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}95\% CI], 1.41 to 3.29) was slightly higher than that of the
   self reported function based definition (HR, 1.93; 95\% CI, 1.24 to
   3.00). Patients who met the self-report based definition but not the
   physical performance definition of frailty (n=192) were not at
   statistically significantly higher risk of mortality than those who were
   not frail by either definition (n=330; HR, 1.41; 95\% CI, 0.81 to 2.45),
   but those who met both definitions of frailty (n=204) were at
   significantly higher risk (HR, 2.46; 95\% CI, 1.51 to 4.01).
   Conclusions Frailty, defined using either direct tests of physical
   performance or self reported physical function, was associated with
   higher mortality among patients receiving hemodialysis. Future studies
   are needed to determine the utility of assessing frailty in clinical
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of reviewFrailty is the concept of accumulating physiologic
   declines that make people less able to deal with stressors, including
   surgery. Prehabilitation is intervention to enhance functional capacity
   before surgery. Frailty and prehabilitation among transplant populations
   and the role of wearable fitness tracking devices (WFTs) in delivering
   fitness-based interventions will be discussed.Recent findingsFrailty is
   associated with increased complications, longer length of hospital stay
   and increased mortality after surgery. Frail kidney transplant patients
   have increased delayed graft function, mortality and early hospital
   readmission. Frail lung or liver transplant patients are more likely to
   delist or die on the waitlist. Prehabilitation can mitigate frailty and
   has resulted in decreased length of hospital stay and fewer postsurgical
   complications among a variety of surgical populations. Increasingly,
   WFTs are used to monitor patient activity and improve patient health.
   Interventions using WFTs have resulted in improved activity, weight loss
   and blood pressure.SummaryFrailty is a measurable parameter that
   identifies patients at risk for worse health outcomes and can be
   mitigated through intervention. Prehabilitation to reduce frailty has
   been shown to improve postsurgical outcomes in a variety of populations.

Abstract = {{The prevalence of diabetes is increasing especially in older age due to
   increased life expectancy. In old age, diabetes is associated with high
   comorbidity burden and increased prevalence of geriatric syndromes
   including frailty in addition to microand macro-vascular complications.
   The emergence of frailty may change the natural history of Type 2
   diabetes from a progressive to a regressive course with increased risk
   of hypoglycemia. This may result in normalization of blood glucose
   levels and lead to a state of burnt-out diabetes in frail older people
   with significant weight loss. Although guidelines suggest relaxed
   glycemic control in frail elderly with diabetes, complete withdrawal of
   hypoglycemic medications may be necessary in these frail populations to
   reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.
   Lay abstract: Diabetes is a common disease especially in older people.
   Aging is associated with reduced appetite and reduced food intake due to
   lack of exercise and diminished energy consumption. In certain
   individuals this may be significant leading to weight loss, malnutrition
   and the development of frailty. As a result the doses of diabetes
   medications may be too strong for this frail population especially if
   they have organ dysfunction reducing medication clearance and increasing
   the risk of low blood glucose level events. Therefore, reduction or
   complete withdrawal of diabetes medications may be considered in this

   in both groups. The incidence of volume depletion-related AEs was 2.2\%,
   3.1\%, and 1.4\% in participants younger than 75 with canagliflozin 100
   and 300mg and non-canagliflozin, respectively, and 4.9\%, 8.7\%, and
   2.6\%, respectively, in those aged 75 and older.
   ConclusionCanagliflozin improved glycemic control, body weight, and BP
   in participants aged 75 and older. The overall incidence of AEs was high
   across treatment groups in participants aged 75 and older and higher
   than in those younger than 75. The safety profile of canagliflozin was
   generally similar in both age groups, with a higher incidence of AEs
   related to volume depletion observed with canagliflozin in participants
   aged 75 and older than in those younger than 75. These findings support
   canagliflozin, starting with the 100-mg dose, as an effective
   therapeutic option for older adults with T2DM.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The majority of dialysis patients are elderly, and the trend
   towards even more elderly people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
   will further determine the dialysis field in the future.
   Method: If these elderly ESRD patients do not opt for conservative ESRD
   care, they may still qualify for peritoneal dialysis (PD), which may be
   assisted or unassisted.
   Results: Although they may be more frail and have a greater co-morbidity
   burden compared to their younger counterparts, elderly patients with
   ESRD may still be able to maintain a good functionality level with
   adequate quality of life by performing PD, which may be assisted
   (treatment performed or supported e.g. by partner or nurse) or
   unassisted (without support). PD may indeed further contribute to
   maintaining autonomy, and enhance quality of life compared to in-center
   conventional hemodialysis. In order to illustrate this strategy, we
   hereby describe a centenarian patient with ESRD who received assisted PD
   successfully.
   Conclusions: With appropriate management and infrastructure, (very) high
   age is not a contra-indication for PD.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal
   involvement can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN),
   immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light chain deposition
   disease (LCDD). Few studies have focused on the prognosis of patients
   with MG on chronic dialysis. We evaluated the outcomes of patients with
   MG incident on chronic dialysis in France.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements All incident patients
   registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry
   between 2002 and 2011 with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were
   included. Patient's survival, censored for renal transplantation, renal
   recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as renal outcomes were analyzed
   and compared with a control group. Risk factors and causes of death were
   analyzed.
   Results We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18\%) patients with
   ALA, 334 (23\%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59\%) patients with MCN.
   Median age was 72 years, and 56\% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1
   months. Renal recovery was observed in 9.1\% of patients and more
   frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation was rare in this population
   (2.3\%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis, 67\% died. Median
   survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were
   malignancies (34.4\%), cardiovascular diseases (18\%), infections
   (13.3\%), and cachexia (5.2\%). Independent risk factors of death were
   age (hazard ratio {[}HR], 1.03 per year increase; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}95\% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty (HR, 1.93; 95\% CI, 1.58 to
   2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95\% CI, 1.23 to 1.93), and
   dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95\% CI, 1.11 to
   1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
   dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95\% CI, 0.91 to 0.99)
   and high BP (HR, 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
   Conclusions Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic
   dialysis is poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is
   the main cause of death in this population. Renal recovery has increased
   since 2006.}},

Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   The purpose of this study was to identify four non-cancer populations
   that might benefit from a palliative approach; and describe and compare
   the prevalence and patterns of dignity related distress across these
   diverse clinical populations.
   Design A prospective, multi-site approach was used.
   Setting Outpatient clinics, inpatient facilities or personal care homes,
   located in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
   Participants Patients with advanced Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),
   Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), End Stage Renal Disease
   (ESRD); and the institutionalized alert frail elderly.
   Main Outcome Measure
   In addition to standardized measures of physical, psychological and
   spiritual aspects of patient experience, the Patient Dignity Inventory
   (PDI).
   Results
   Between February 2009 and December 2012, 404 participants were recruited
   (ALS, 101; COPD, 100; ESRD, 101; and frail elderly, 102). Depending on
   group designation, 35\% to 58\% died within one year of taking part in
   the study. While moderate to severe loss of sense of dignity did not
   differ significantly across the four study populations (4-11\%), the
   number of PDI items reported as problematic was significantly different
   i.e. ALS 6.2 (5.2), COPD 5.6 (5.9), frail elderly 3.0 (4.4) and ESRD 2.3
   (3.9) {[}p < .0001]. Each of the study populations also revealed unique
   and distinct patterns of physical, psychological and existential
   distress.
   Conclusion
   People with ALS, COPD, ESRD and the frail elderly face unique challenges
   as they move towards the end of life. Knowing the intricacies of
   distress and how they differ across these groups broadens our
   understanding of end-of-life experience within non-cancer populations
   and how best to meet their palliative care needs.}},

Pages = {{736-745}},
Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Previous studies showed that frailty is prevalent in
   both pre-dialysis and dialysis patients. However, the prevalence and
   prognostic implication of frailty in Chinese peritoneal dialysis (PD)
   patients remain unknown. Methods: We used a validated questionnaire to
   determine the Frailty Score of 193 unselected prevalent PD patients. All
   patients were then followed for 2 years for their need of
   hospitalization and mortality. Results: Amongst the 193 patients, 134
   (69.4\%) met the criteria of being frail. Frailty Score significantly
   correlated with Charlson's comorbidity score (r = 0.40, p < 0.0001),
   Malnutrition Inflammation Score (r = 0.59, p < 0.0001), and inversely
   with Subjective Global Assessment score (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001). Frailty
   was closely associated with the need of hospitalization. Patients with
   nil, mild, moderate, and severe frailty required 2.4 +/- 6.0, 1.6 +/-
   1.6, 2.7 +/- 2.5, 5.2 +/- 4.8 hospital admissions per year, respectively
   (p < 0.0001), and they stayed in hospital for 64 +/- 9.2, 5.3 +/- 6.2,
   10.0 +/- 10.4, 12.9 +/- 20.1 days per hospital admission, respectively
   (p < 0.0001) However, Frailty Score was not an independent predictor of
   patient or technique survival. Conclusions: Frailty is prevalent among
   Chinese PD patients. Frail PD patients have a high risk of requiring
   hospitalization and their hospital stay tends to be prolonged. Early
   identification may allow timely intervention to prevent adverse health

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{226-232}},
Abstract = {{Background In elderly patients, especially those older than 80 years,
   atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an almost 25\% increased
   risk of stroke. Stroke prophylaxis with anticoagulants is therefore
   highly recommended. The prevalence of factors that have been associated
   with a lower rate of prescription and adherence to anticoagulant therapy
   in these patients is little known. The objective of this study was to
   explore the clinical characteristics of elderly subjects, with and
   without AF, consecutively admitted to an acute geriatric unit,
   discussing factors that may decrease the persistence on stroke
   prophylaxis therapy. We also highlight possible strategies to overcome
   the barriers conditioning the current underuse of oral anticoagulants in
   this segment of the population. Methods A retrospective observational
   study was performed on a cohort of elderly patients with and without AF
   admitted to the Acute Geriatric Unit of San Gerardo Hospital (Monza,
   Italy). Results Compared to patients without AF (n = 1216), those with
   AF (n = 403) had a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (3 vs. 2, P <
   0.001), number of administered drugs (4 vs. 3, P < 0.001), rate of heart
   failure (36.5\% vs. 12\%, P < 0.001) and chronic kidney disease (20.6
   vs. 13.2, P < 0.001). Many patients with AF were frail (54\%) or
   pre-frail (29\%). Conclusions Elderly patients with AF have higher rates
   of conditions that affect adherence to traditional anticoagulant therapy
   (vitamin K antagonists, VKA). New direct oral anticoagulants (DOAs) can
   help overcome this problem. In order to prescribe the most appropriate
   VKA or DOAs, with the best efficacy/safety profile and the highest
   compliance, a comprehensive geriatric assessment should always accompany
   the scores for thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk stratification.}},

Journal = {{BMJ OPEN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Introduction As the average age of haemodialysis patients rapidly
   increases around the world, the number of frail, elderly patients has
   increased. Frailty is well known to be an indicator of disability and a
   poor prognosis for haemodialysis patients. Exercise interventions have
   been safely and successfully implemented for middle-aged or younger
   patients undergoing haemodialysis. However, the benefits of exercise
   interventions on elderly patients undergoing haemodialysis remain
   controversial. The main objective of this study is to systematically
   review the effects of exercise training on the physical function,
   exercise capacity and quality of life of elderly patients undergoing
   haemodialysis, and to provide an update on the relevant evidence.
   Methods and analyses Published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that
   assessed the effectiveness of exercise training on haemodialysis
   patients with respect to physical function, exercise tolerance and
   quality of life will be included. Bibliographic databases include
   MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the
   Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, Web of Science,
   PsycINFO and PEDro. The risk of bias of the included RCTs will be
   assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and TESTEX. The primary
   outcome will be physical function and exercise tolerance. This review
   protocol is reported according to the PRISMA-P 2015 checklist.
   Statistical analysis will be performed using review manager software
   (RevMan V.5.3, Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England).
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required because this
   study does not include confidential personal data nor does it perform
   interventions on patients. This review is expected to inform readers on
   the effectiveness of exercise training in elderly patients undergoing
   haemodialysis. Findings will be presented at conferences and submitted
   to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.

Abstract = {{Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing
   population among the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney
   transplantation. There is ample evidence to suggest that kidney
   transplant in the elderly population offers the best chance of survival
   and improves health-related quality of life compared to remaining on
   dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this
   population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty,
   cognitive impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be
   barriers to transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients
   after transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the
   immune system and affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants.
   All these changes can increase risk of complications such as infections
   and malignancy. Because death with a functioning graft is a common cause
   of graft loss, the new kidney allocation system has been implemented in
   an attempt to maximize allograft utilization and minimize unrealized
   graft years. This may result in longer wait-times for the elderly. In
   this review, we will highlight the barriers to kidney transplant,

Abstract = {{Palliative care is a branch of medicine dedicated to the relief of
   symptoms experienced during the course of illness. Renal palliative
   medicine or kidney supportive care is an evolving branch of nephrology,
   which incorporates the principles of palliative care into the care of
   CKD and ESRD (dialysis, transplant, and conservatively managed)
   patients. Conservative (non-dialytic) management is a legitimate option
   for frail, elderly CKD patients in whom dialysis may not lead to an
   improvement in quality or duration of life. Patients with advanced CKD
   have a high symptom burden that often worsens before death. Palliative
   or supportive care by visiting nurses, palliative care programs, or
   knowledgeable CKD programs should be routine for conservatively managed
   CKD patients. Decision-making about dialysis or conservative management
   requires patients and families be given information on prognosis,
   quality of life on dialysis, and options for supportive care. Advance
   care planning is the process by which these issues can be explored. In
   addition to advance care planning, because patients with ESRD have a
   high symptom burden, this needs to be addressed. Patients with ESRD have
   a high symptom burden, which needs to be addressed in any treatment
   plan. Common symptoms include pain, fatigue, insomnia, pruritus,
   anorexia, and nausea. Symptoms appear to increase as the patient nears
   death, and this must be anticipated. Recommendations for management are
   discussed in the article. Hospice care should be offered to all patients
   who are expected to die within the next 6 months, and supportive care
   should be provided to all CKD patients managed conservatively or with
   dialysis. (C) 2016 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Frailty is associated with worse health-related quality of
   life (HRQOL) in older adults and worse clinical outcomes in adults of
   all ages with end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is unclear whether
   frail adults of all ages with ESRD are more likely to experience worse
   HRQOL. Objective: The goal of this study was to identify factors
   associated with worsening HRQOL in this population. Design, setting and
   measurements: We studied 233 adults of all ages with ESRD enrolled
   (11/2009-11/2013) in a longitudinal cohort study. Frailty status was
   measured at enrollment and HRQOL was reported (Excellent, Very Good,
   Good, Fair or Poor) at the initial assessment and follow-up (median
   follow-up 9.4 months). We studied factors associated with Fair/Poor
   HRQOL at follow-up using logistic regression and factors associated with
   HRQOL change using multinomial regression. All models were adjusted for
   age, sex, race, education, BMI, diabetes status, history of a previous
   transplant, type of dialysis and time between assessments. Results:
   Fair/Poor HRQOL was reported by 28\% at initial assessment and 33\% at
   follow-up. 47.2\% of participants had stable HRQOL, 22.8\% better HRQOL,
   and 30.0\% worse HRQOL at follow-up (P<0.001). In adjusted models, only
   frailty was associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up (OR: 2.79, 95\%
   CI: 1.32-5.90) and worsening HRQOL at follow-up (RR: 2.91, 95\% CI:
   1.08-7.80). Conclusions: Frail adults of all ages with ESRD are more
   likely to experience fair/poor HRQOL and worsening HRQOL over time.
   Frailty represents a state of decreased physiologic reserve that impacts
   not only clinical outcomes but also the patient-centered outcome of

Abstract = {{Background The levels of many laboratory parameters are associated with
   the outcomes of dialysis patients, but the significance of their
   variability has not been well studied.
   MethodsA total of 384 patients receiving stable hemodialysis treatment
   during 2002 were followed up for mortality until the end of 2013. The
   within-patient coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for 13
   laboratory parameters from 1 year of data. We defined variability as CV
   and analyzed the survival of the patients according to the baseline CV
   values of each parameter by proportional hazard modeling.
   ResultsDuring the 11-year observation period, 125 patients died. Higher
   CV levels for eight parameters, namely, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
   sodium, hemoglobin, creatinine, total protein, albumin, potassium and
   phosphate, were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The
   adjusted hazard ratios for a high BUN-CV (> 15 \%) and a high Na-CV (>
   1.3 \%) against a lower CV were 1.92 (95 \% CI 1.31-2.81) and 1.95
   (1.36-2.80), respectively. The increased mortality risk associated with
   each variability was attributed to excess non-cardiac deaths. The CV
   values of most parameters were correlated with each other and often
   exhibited negative associations with age, diabetes, and mobility as well
   as the levels of hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, Na, the protein
   catabolic rate, and the creatinine generation rate. Therefore, a high
   variability was generally associated with frailty-related adverse
   prognostic factors.
   ConclusionsThe variability of several blood parameters had a significant
   impact on all-cause and non-cardiac mortality. The levels of the
   variabilities were most likely related to poor physical conditions of
   the patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Patients of all ages undergoing hemodialysis
   (HD) have a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and worse cognitive
   function than healthy controls, and those with dementia are at high risk
   of death. Frailty has been associated with poor cognitive function in
   older adults without kidney disease. We hypothesized that frailty might
   also be associated with poor cognitive function in adults of all ages
   undergoing HD.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements At HD initiation, 324
   adults enrolled (November 2008 to July 2012) in a longitudinal cohort
   study (Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in ESRD) were
   classified into three groups (frail, intermediately frail, and nonfrail)
   based on the Fried frailty phenotype. Global cognitive function (3MS)
   and speed/attention (Trail Making Tests A and B {[}TMTA and TMTB,
   respectively]) were assessed at cohort entry and 1-year follow-up.
   Associations between frailty and cognitive function (at cohort entry and
   1-year follow-up) were evaluated in adjusted (for sex, age, race, body
   mass index, education, depression and comorbidity at baseline) linear
   (3MS, TMTA) and Tobit (TMTB) regression models.
   Results At cohort entry, the mean age was 54.8 years (SD 13.3), 56.5\%
   were men, and 72.8\% were black. The prevalence of frailty and
   intermediate frailty were 34.0\% and 37.7\%, respectively. The mean 3MS
   was 89.8 (SD 7.6), TMTA was 55.4 (SD 29), and TMTB was 161 (SD 83).
   Frailty was independently associated with lower cognitive function at
   cohort entry for all three measures (3M5: -2.4 points; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}95\% CI], -4.2 to -0.5; P=0.01; TMTA: 12.1 seconds; 95\% CI,
   4.7 to 19.4; P<0.001; and TMTB: 33.2 seconds; 95\% CI, 9.9 to 56.4;
   P=0.01; all tests for trend, P<0.001) and with worse 3MS at 1-year
   follow-up (-2.8 points; 95\% CI, -5.4 to -0.2; P=0.03).
   Conclusions In adult incident HD patients, frailty is associated with
   worse cognitive function, particularly global cognitive function (3MS).}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: In elderly hemodialysis patients, protein-energy wasting is
   associated with poor outcome; however, the association between body mass
   index (BMI) changes over time, and survival has been seldom studied in
   this particularly frail population.
   Design and Methods: This prospective study recruited 502 hemodialysis
   patients aged >= 75 years from the French cohort ARNOS and followed them
   from 2005 to 2009. BMI changes over time were modeled by individual
   linear regression models. Survival analyses used frailty Cox models.
   Results: The population average age was 80.9 years. Forty-one percent of
   the patients died during follow-up. A 1 kg/m(2) lower baseline BMI was
   associated with a 4\% increase in the risk of death over the study
   period (hazard ratio {[}HR] 1.04, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}1.01-1.08], P = .02). A 5\% BMI loss per year was associated with a
   52\% increase in the risk of death (HR 1.52, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}1.32-1.75], P < .001). In patients who lost weight (>5\% BMI loss per
   year), the lower was the baseline BMI, the higher was the HR for death.
   There was a similar trend in the patients with stable weight (5\% BMI
   loss-5\% BMI gain per year). In patients who gained weight, the HR was
   unexpectedly higher than in those with stable weight.
   Conclusions: In elderly hemodialysis patients, the impact of the BMI
   percent change on survival was stronger than that of the baseline BMI.
   Patients with stable weight had longer survivals than patients who lost
   or gained weight. Thus, in this population, BMI changes should be
   regularly assessed. Further studies should assess the safety of weight
   gain strategies. (C) 2015 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc. All

Abstract = {{Selecting peritoneal dialysis (PD) in older individuals is a complex,
   multi-step process. At each step, older individuals may not have the
   opportunity to receive PD unless care is optimized. Older individuals
   are less likely to complete a PD assessment, because of unstable medical
   conditions, consideration of palliative care, or reluctance to approach
   frail patients once they are established on hemodialysis (HD). Older
   individuals are also more likely to have medical or social conditions
   that contraindicate PD or to have barriers to self-care PD that may not
   be overcome with support. Older individuals who are eligible for PD may
   be reluctant to choose it, leaving HD as the default modality. Finally,
   receipt of PD may be compromised by urgent HD or PD catheter-related
   complications at the time of insertion. Despite all these challenges,
   older patients can do very well on PD, so each step should be well
   understood and optimized in renal programs to maximize PD use in older

Abstract = {{Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe
   cumulative declines across multiple physiological systems that occur
   with aging and lead individuals to a state of diminished physiological
   reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided
   a standardized definition for frailty, and they created the concept of
   frailty phenotype which incorporates disturbances across interrelated
   domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness, and
   low physical activity level) to indentify old people who are at risk of
   disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and premature
   death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
   (sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has
   been documented in 7 \% of elderly population and 14 \% of not requiring
   dialysis CKD adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along
   with loss of renal function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis
   population. It has been documented that prevalence of frailty in
   hemodialysis adult patients is around 42 \% (35 \% in young and 50 \% in
   elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of mortality and 1.43-fold
   higher number of hospitalization, independent of age, comorbidity, and
   disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and clinically
   useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
   diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body
   imaging techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated
   with a handheld dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different
   strategies, such as exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs,
   vitamins, and antioxidant agents. Finally, palliative care is a very
   important alternative for very frail and sick patients. In conclusion,
   since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and sarcopenia is crucial
   in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very important to
   incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis,
   hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and
   consequently treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, an increasing number of patients over 75 years of
   age are starting renal replacement therapy. Frailty is highly prevalent
   in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the context
   of the increased prevalence of some ESRD-associated conditions:
   protein-energy wasting, inflammation, anaemia, acidosis or hormonal
   disturbances. There are currently no hard data to support guidance on
   the optimal duration of dialysis for frail/elderly ESRD patients. The
   current debate is not about starting dialysis or managing conservatory
   frail ESRD patients, but whether a more intensive regimen once dialysis
   is initiated (for whatever reasons and circumstances) would improve
   patients' outcome. The most important issue is that all studies
   performed with extended/alternative dialysis regimens do not
   specifically address this particular type of patients and therefore all
   the inferences are derived from the general ESRD population. Care
   planning should be responsive to end-of-life needs whatever the
   treatment modality. Care in this setting should focus on symptom control
   and quality of life rather than life extension. We conclude that,
   similar to the general dialysed population, extensive application of
   more intensive dialysis schedules is not based on solid evidence.
   However, after a thorough clinical evaluation, a limited period of a
   trial of intensive dialysis could be prescribed in more problematic
   patients.}},

Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at increased risk of sudden
   cardiac death, the risk of which is presumably related to arrhythmia.
   Electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters have been found to correlate with
   arrhythmia and predict cardiovascular outcomes in ESRD patients. Frailty
   is also a common feature in this population. We investigate whether the
   severity of dialysis frailty is associated with ECG findings, including
   PR interval, QRS duration, and QTc interval. Presence and severity of
   frailty was ascertained using six different self-report questionnaires
   with proven construct validity. Correlation analysis between frailty
   severity and ECG was made, and those with significant association
   entered into multiple regression analysis for confirmation. Among a
   cohort of chronic hemodialysis patients, we found that frailty severity,
   assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale, is significantly associated with
   QRS duration (r = -0.3, p < 0.05). Dialysis patients with QRS longer
   than 120 ms had significantly lower severity of frailty than those with
   QRS less than 120 ms (p = 0.01 for the Edmonton frailty scale and 0.05
   for simple FRAIL scale). Regression analysis showed that frailty
   severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale and simple FRAIL scale,
   was significantly associated with QRS duration independent of serum
   electrolyte levels. In conclusion, a significant relationship exists
   between the severity of frailty and QRS duration in ESRD patients. This
   might be an under-recognized link between frailty and its adverse
   cardiovascular impact in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Currently over 55\% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
   patients are aged 60 years and patients >75 years represent the fastest
   growing segment of the dialysis population. We aimed to assess whether
   the Groningen frailty indicator (GFI) can be used to distinguish fit
   older ESRD patients, likely able to tolerate and benefit from dialysis,
   from frail older patients who need further evaluation with a
   geriatrician's comprehensive assessment. Methods: All patients aged 65
   years visiting the pre-dialysis unit at the Gelre hospital between 2007
   and 2013 were included and underwent the GFI (n=65). Patients with GFI4
   (frail) were referred for geriatric consultation (n=13). Results of the
   GFI and nephrologists' evaluation were compared with geriatrician's
   assessment. Survival rates and outcomes after one year of follow up were
   recorded. Results: Twenty patients (32\%) were identified as frail. Of
   the problems identified by the geriatrician in 13 patients, 55\% were
   not reported in the nephrologists' notes. The first year after
   inclusion, 30\% of patients with a GFI4 died, compared to 9\% of fit
   patients (p=0.04). Moreover, 90\% of frail patients had been
   hospitalized one or more times, compared to 53\% in the fit group
   (p=0.005). Conclusion: Although the GFI can be a useful instrument to
   identify ESRD patients at risk, both the GFI and the nephrologists'
   assessment failed to identify specific geriatric impairments. Further
   research is needed to develop a specific frailty indicator for ESRD
   patients and to determine the value and effect of a comprehensive
   geriatric assessment in ESRD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Patients suffering from end-stage renal disease experience multiple
   disabilities, such as muscle wasting, weakness, higher postural sway,
   and fall rates compared with healthy population, which has a negative
   effect on physical functioning and autonomy. The vital treatment of
   hemodialysis is recognized to induce important post-hemodialysis
   fatigue, hypotension, cramps, and headache due to the rapid fluid
   redistribution, among others. Nevertheless, even the well-known negative
   effect of aforementioned consequences of hemodialysis treatment, its
   effect on physical function, especially postural balance, is unclear.
   Thus, this study hypothesized the adverse effect of hemodialysis
   treatment on postural sway in 12 end-stage renal disease patients (mean
   age 63.3 +/- 11 years) through the analysis of center-of-pressure (COP)
   trajectories recorded before and immediately after hemodialysis session.
   Evident postural alterations were observed at post-hemodialysis balance
   assessment for COP position-based (Fs<7.7, P<0.02) and COP
   velocity-based variables (Fs>2.33, P<0.05), without changes in
   complexity of COP time series in anteroposterior and mediolateral
   directions. These results suggest that period after hemodialysis
   treatment is particularly unsafe, as evidenced by important disability
   in postural control, and highlight the importance of the medical support
   and falls-related prevention strategies of these older frail patients
   after hemodialysis treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a life-threatening renal infection
   caused by gas-producing bacteria and fungi. It usually occurs in
   patients with diabetes and patients with urinary tract obstruction. A
   combination of systemic antibiotics, percutaneous catheter drainage, or
   open nephrectomy is typically required to achieve cure. Because of grim
   prognosis, resorting to interventional methods is frequently inevitable.
   We report the case of a 77-year-old woman with diabetes and end-stage
   renal disease on chronic hemodialysis that presented with fever and left
   flank pain. A bubbly gas pattern inside the left kidney was demonstrated
   on abdominal computed tomography scan and blood cultures grew
   Escherichia coli. She was successfully treated solely with systemic
   antibiotics. This highlights the fact that prompt recognition of imaging
   findings associated with benign prognosis is essential for a favorable
   outcome. It allows for an effective management avoiding high-risk
   interventions, especially in frail patients with multiple comorbidities.
   Finally, we review all published cases of EPN in chronic dialysis
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Dental disease is more extensive in adults with chronic
   kidney disease, but whether dental health and behaviors are associated
   with survival in the setting of hemodialysis is unknown.
   Study Design: Prospective multinational cohort.
   Setting \& Participants: 4,205 adults treated with long-term
   hemodialysis, 2010 to 2012 (Oral Diseases in Hemodialysis {[}ORAL-D]
   Study).
   Predictors: Dental health as assessed by a standardized dental
   examination using World Health Organization guidelines and personal oral
   care, including edentulousness; decayed, missing, and filled teeth
   index; teeth brushing and flossing; and dental health consultation.
   Outcomes: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months after
   dental assessment.
   Measurements: Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression
   models fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality
   risk within countries.
   Results: During a mean follow-up of 22.1 months, 942 deaths occurred,
   including 477 cardiovascular deaths. Edentulousness (adjusted HR, 1.29;
   95\% CI, 1.10-1.51) and decayed, missing, or filled teeth score >= 14
   (adjusted HR, 1.70; 95\% CI, 1.33-2.17) were associated with early
   all-cause mortality, while dental flossing, using mouthwash, brushing
   teeth daily, spending at least 2 minutes on oral hygiene daily, changing
   a toothbrush at least every 3 months, and visiting a dentist within the
   past 6 months (adjusted HRs of 0.52 {[}95\% CI, 0.32-0.85], 0.79 {[}95\%

   for cardiovascular mortality were similar.
   Limitations: Convenience sample of clinics.
   Conclusions: In adults treated with hemodialysis, poorer dental health
   was associated with early death, whereas preventive dental health
   practices were associated with longer survival. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Background: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in
   the elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney
   Disease in comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed
   in non-elderly individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such
   as muscle strength, body composition and inflammation. The association
   between frailty and endothelial function, as well as the association
   between frailty and the combined outcome of mortality multiple cause and
   start of renal replace therapy were assessed.
   Methods: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with
   Chronic Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study.
   Due to patient drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were
   subsequently re-evaluated 12 months later. The diagnosis of frailty was
   based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007)
   criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail and Frail.
   Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
   endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body
   composition (DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
   Results: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 +/-
   10.3 years old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6 \%, of which 46 \%
   were non-elderly. After some adjustments, frailty was associated with
   gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95 \% = 2.30 to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07;
   IC 95 \% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; IC 95 \% = 0.82 to 11.44)
   and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95 \% = 1.00 to 14.88). The
   ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 2.5
   (CI 95 \%, 1.04 to 6.50).
   Conclusions: Although an observational study does not allow one to
   determine the casual relation between frailty and endothelial
   dysfunction, we conclude that frailty was predominant in our sample of
   Brazilian patients with chronic kidney disease on predialysis, even in
   elderly individuals. This was linked to either worse endothelial
   function or mortality.}},

Abstract = {{AimTo determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic

   MethodsOne hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were

   and divided by the total number of deficits considered, to derive an
   FI-CKD.
   ResultsOne hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate
   and assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD
   was 0.25 (SD 0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3\% per year,
   correlated with a modified Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased
   significantly across CKD stages (P = 0.04).

Abstract = {{Recommendations for the management of hypertension in the elderly are
   largely consistent with the exception of the 2013 Joint National
   Committee (JNC) 8 guidelines that recommend lowering systolic blood
   pressure (SBP) in persons aged >= 60 years to <150 mmHg if they do not
   have diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. In contrast, I concur
   with the minority view from JNC 8 which recommends a SBP goal in these
   persons aged 60 to 79 years of <140 mmHg. This view is consistent with
   the 2011 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
   (ACC/AHA) guidelines that also recommend a SBP goal of 140 to 145 mmHg
   if tolerated in adults aged = 80 years. ACC/AHA consensus guidelines use
   the totality of evidence in addition to randomized controlled trial
   data. These guidelines are also consistent with treatment
   recommendations from numerous other societies that recommend SBP goals
   of <140 mmHg in persons aged 60 to 79 years and <150 mmHg in persons
   aged >= 80 years. Hypertension is currently under-treated in the
   elderly, and relaxation of ACC/AHA guidelines by JNC 8 will result in
   substantially more cardiovascular events. Randomized clinical trial

Abstract = {{In the age of person-centered care, there is an emphasis on promoting
   patient autonomy and surrogate decision maker authority in making
   treatment decisions that are aligned with the patient's priorities and
   values. As technological advances offer multiple clinical options with
   various levels and types of risks and benefits, person-centered clinical
   practice encourages the incorporation of patients' and families'
   heterogeneous experiences into decisions regarding illness management.
   In caring for frail elderly adults, clinicians are sometimes faced with
   situations in which individuals and their surrogate decision-makers
   request a treatment that the clinicians feel is clinically
   inappropriate. This article provides a case example of a frail older
   adult with advanced chronic kidney disease who requests dialysis despite
   the advice of his nephrologist to pursue conservative management. The
   four-box approach, which provides clinicians with a structured ethical
   framework to facilitate informed and ethically justified treatment
   decisions, is then introduced. By considering the patient's medical
   indications, preferences, quality of life, and contextual factors, how
   each consideration plays a unique yet equally important role in
   informing clinically responsible and person-centered care is
   illustrated.}},

Abstract = {{Hip fracture is a common occurrence in the elderly. Due to the growing
   demand for the specific care of these patients, we established the
   Orthogeriatric Unit (OGU) at San Gerardo University Hospital (Italy) in
   2007. However, simultaneous bilateral femoral neck fractures among the
   geriatric population (those aged >= 65 years) are rarely reported in the
   literature. Reporting the rare case of a frail 76-year-old woman
   admitted with bilateral hip fracture and end-stage renal disease, we
   explain the important role played by the OGU and its flexible
   multidisciplinary approach for providing comprehensive care to patients
   with multimorbidity and clinical complexity. The team of geriatricians,
   orthopedic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and, in this case, a
   nephrologist, helped in the careful planning and timing of the
   single-step surgical repair, decided the appropriate type of anesthesia,
   and optimized outcomes. After a prompt evaluation of the patient, the
   OGU approach can achieve clinical stabilization prior to intervention.
   Along with a strict follow-up in the postoperative phase, this could
   result in a significant reduction of complications and mortality rates
   and an early start to a tailored rehabilitation process. We strongly
   suggest employing facilities with multidisciplinary teams for cases
   involving complex patients at short-term high risk for poor clinical
   outcomes. Indeed, the usual single-specialist model of care is gradually
   being abandoned worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The number of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease
   opting for conservative management rather than dialysis is unknown but
   likely to be growing as increasingly frail patients with advanced renal
   disease present to renal services. Conservative kidney management
   includes ongoing medical input and support from a multidisciplinary
   team. There is limited evidence concerning patient and carer experience
   of this choice. This study will explore quality of life, symptoms,
   cognition, frailty, performance decision making, costs and impact on
   carers in people with advanced chronic kidney disease managed without
   dialysis and is funded by the National Institute of Health Research in
   the UK.
   Methods: In this prospective, multicentre, longitudinal study, patients
   will be recruited in the UK, by renal research nurses, once they have
   made the decision not to embark on dialysis. Carers will be asked to
   `opt-in' with consent from patients. The approach includes longitudinal
   quantitative surveys of quality of life, symptoms, decision making and
   costs for patients and quality of life and costs for carers, with
   questionnaires administered quarterly over 12 months. Additionally, the
   decision making process will be explored via qualitative interviews with
   renal physicians/clinical nurse specialists.
   Discussion: The study is designed to capture patient and carer profiles
   when conservative kidney management is implemented, and understand
   trajectories of care-receiving and care-giving with the aim of
   optimising palliative care for this population. It will explore the
   interactions that lead to clinical care decisions and the impact of
   these decisions on informal carers with the intention of improving

Abstract = {{Nonexperimental studies of preventive interventions are often biased

   indicators of illness. We explored bias reduction methods while
   estimating vaccine effectiveness in a cohort of adult hemodialysis
   patients. Using the United States Renal Data System and linked data from
   a commercial dialysis provider, we estimated vaccine effectiveness using
   a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model of all-cause
   mortality before and during 3 influenza seasons in 2005/2006 through
   2007/2008. To improve confounding control, we added frailty indicators
   to the model, measured time-varying confounders at different time
   intervals, and restricted the sample in multiple ways. Crude and
   baseline-adjusted marginal structural models remained strongly biased.
   Restricting to a healthier population removed some unmeasured
   confounding; however, this reduced the sample size, resulting in wide
   confidence intervals. We estimated an influenza vaccine effectiveness of
   9\% (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95\% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.15) when

Abstract = {{Chronic kidney disease (CKD) elderly patients have a reduced glomerular

Abstract = {{Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong
   condition with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD
   experience frailty more frequently and have lower health-related quality
   of life than do those with other chronic diseases. The purpose of this
   study was to examine the prevalence of frailty and investigate the
   contribution of frailty to quality of life in pre-dialysis CKD patients
   in Korea.
   Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at
   an outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty
   criterion was modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health
   Survey version 2 was used to measure physical and mental component
   summary scores. Data were analyzed using chi-square, t-tests, and
   hierarchical linear regression.
   Results: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 \%) were frail. Frail
   patients were significantly older and had lower physical and mental
   quality of life than those who were non-frail. In hierarchical
   regression evaluating the influence of frailty on physical and mental
   quality of life, the initial model was significantly improved when
   frailty was included. Frail patients had lower physical and mental
   quality of life.
   Conclusions: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life
   in pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for
   patients on dialysis; however, previous studies have not taken into
   account the severity of frailty as a predictor of outcomes. The purpose
   of this study was to assess if there was an association between the
   degree of frailty and mortality among patients on incident dialysis.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements A cohort study of
   incident chronic dialysis patients was conducted between January of 2009
   and June of 2013 (last follow-up in December of 2013). On the basis of
   overall clinical impression, the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score was
   determined for patients at the start of dialysis by their primary
   nephrologist. This simple scale allocates a single point to different
   states of frailty (1, very fit; 2, well; 3, managing well; 4,
   vulnerable; 5, mildly frail; 6, moderately frail; 7, severely frail or
   terminally ill) with an emphasis on function of the assessed individual.
   The primary outcome was time to death. Patients were censored at the
   time of transplantation.
   Results The cohort consisted of 390 patients with completed CFS scores
   (mean age of 63 +/- 15 years old). Most were Caucasian (89\%) and men
   (67\%), and 30\% of patients had ESRD caused by diabetic nephropathy.
   The median Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 4 (interquartile range
   =3-6), and the median CFS score was 4 (interquartile range =2-5). There
   were 96 deaths over 750 patient-years at risk. In an adjusted Cox
   survival analysis, the hazard ratio associated with each 1-point
   increase in the CFS was 1.22 (95\% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.43;
   P=0.02).
   Conclusions A higher severity of frailty (as defined by the CFS) at
   dialysis initiation is associated with higher mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Decisions and discussions about the initiation of dialysis in the
   elderly are often challenging because of the high prevalence of
   comorbidities and frailty in this population. Mortality is high,
   functional decline is likely, and quality of life tends to be lower in
   the elderly on dialysis. It is thus important to counsel these patients
   on the risks, benefits, and burdens of dialysis to assist them in making
   an informed choice that is in line with their goals, preferences, and
   expectations. For some patients, dialysis may be a desirable choice. For
   others, the alternative of palliative care may provide a more favorable
   balance of benefits versus burdens. Elderly patients who choose to
   proceed with dialysis often benefit from an interdisciplinary team that
   helps to manage and monitor their health status, while maximizing the
   benefits of treatment and decreasing its potential harms. These goals
   can be promoted by effective communication and through individualized
   decisions about vascular access, medication choices, and dietary
   limitations. Finally, close monitoring of functional status will help to
   determine whether dialysis remains in a patient's best interest and when
   alternatives should be offered.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of reviewProtein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic
   and nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic
   kidney disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle
   wasting and cachexia are common and strongly associated with mortality
   in CKD, which is reviewed here.Recent findingsThe
   malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among the
   comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The
   association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more
   advanced CKD stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity
   paradox. Frailty is closely associated with PEW, muscle wasting and
   cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger associations with unfavorable
   outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy supplementation combined with
   low-protein diet for the management of CKD may prevent the development
   of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but dietary
   protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis
   therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum
   bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23mEq/l for
   nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively.
   A benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively
   proven.SummaryPrevention and treatment of PEW should involve
   individualized and integrated approaches to modulate identified risk
   factors and contributing comorbidities.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on
   its impact on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of
   different self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these
   patients has not been attempted before.
   Methods: A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural
   centre was recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report
   questionnaires were administered to these patients. Clinical and
   dialysis-related laboratory parameters were collected. Correlation
   analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis complications were
   performed, and variables demonstrating significant correlations were
   entered into multivariate regression models to determine their
   independent associations.
   Results: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton
   Frail Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8
   questionnaire, and Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural
   patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire
   showed significant association with each other, except the G8
   questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated
   significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher
   Liu's comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and
   creatinine levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The
   other five questionnaires did not show consistently significant
   relationships with important dialysis-related complications.
   Multivariate linear regression analysis identified an independently
   negative association between serum albumin and the simple FRAIL scale
   results (P = 0.01).
   Conclusion: This is the first study establishing the utility of
   different self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic
   dialysis patients. The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a
   closer relationship with dialysis-related complications.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is a need to improve end-of-life care for people with
   end-stage kidney disease, particularly due to the increasingly elderly,
   frail and co-morbid end-stage kidney disease population. Timely,
   sensitive and individualised Advance Care Planning discussions are
   acceptable and beneficial for people with end-stage kidney disease and
   can help foster realistic hopes and goals.
   Aim: To explore the experiences of people with end-stage kidney disease
   regarding starting haemodialysis, its impact on quality of life and
   their preferences for future care and to explore the Advance Care
   Planning needs of this population and the timing of this support.
   Study design: Semi-structured qualitative interview study of people
   receiving haemodialysis. Interviews were analysed using thematic
   analysis. Recruitment ceased once data saturation was achieved.
   Setting/participants: A total of 20 patients at two UK National Health
   Service hospitals, purposively sampled by age, time on haemodialysis and
   symptom burden.
   Results: Themes emerged around: Looking Back, emotions of commencing
   haemodialysis; Current Experiences, illness and treatment burdens; and
   Looking Ahead, facing the realities. Challenges throughout the
   trajectory included getting information, communicating with staff and
   the conveyor belt' culture of haemodialysis units. Participants reported
   a lack of opportunity to discuss their future, particularly if their
   health deteriorated, and variable involvement in treatment decisions.
   However, discussion of these sensitive issues was more acceptable to
   some than others.
   Conclusion: Renal patients have considerable unmet Advance Care Planning
   needs. There is a need to normalise discussions about preferences and
   priorities in renal and haemodialysis units earlier in the disease
   trajectory. However, an individualised approach is essential - one size
   does not fit all.}},

Abstract = {{The two most commonly employed frailty measures are the frailty
   phenotype and the frailty index. We compared them to examine whether
   they demonstrated common characteristics of frailty scales, and to
   examine their association with adverse health measures including
   disability, self-reported health, and healthcare utilization. The study
   examined adults aged 50+ (n = 4096) from a sequential, cross-sectional
   sample (2003-2004; 2005-2006), National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey. The frailty phenotype was modified from a previously adapted
   version and a 46-item frailty index was created following a standard
   protocol. Both measures demonstrated a right-skewed distribution, higher
   levels of frailty in women, exponential increase with age and
   associations with high healthcare utilization and poor self-reported
   health. More people classified as frail by the modified phenotype had
   ADL disability (97.8\%) compared with the frailty index (56.6\%) and
   similarly for IADL disability (95\% vs. 85.6\%). The prevalence of
   frailty was 3.6\% using the modified frailty phenotype and 34\% using
   the frailty index. Frailty index scores in those who were classified as
   robust by the modified phenotype were still significantly associated
   with poor self-reported health and high healthcare utilization. The
   frailty index and the modified frailty phenotype each confirmed
   previously established characteristics of frailty scales. The agreement
   between frailty and disability was high with each measure, suggesting
   that frailty is not simply a pre-disability stage. Overall, the frailty
   index classified more people as frail, and suggested that it may have
   the ability to discriminate better at the lower to middle end of the
   frailty continuum. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BMC GERIATRICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frailty, a validated measure of physiologic reserve,
   predicts adverse health outcomes among adults with end-stage renal
   disease. Frailty typically is not measured clinically; instead, a
   surrogate-perceived frailty-is used to inform clinical decision-making.
   Because correlations between perceived and measured frailty remain
   unknown, the aim of this study was to assess their relationship.
   Methods: 146 adults undergoing hemodialysis were recruited from a single
   dialysis center in Baltimore, Maryland. Patient characteristics
   associated with perceived (reported by nephrologists, nurse
   practitioners (NPs), or patients) or measured frailty (using the Fried
   criteria) were identified using ordered logistic regression. The
   relationship between perceived and measured frailty was assessed using
   percent agreement, kappa statistic, Pearson's correlation coefficient,
   and prevalence of misclassification of frailty. Patient characteristics
   associated with misclassification were determined using Fisher's exact
   tests, t-tests, or median tests.
   Results: Older age (adjusted OR {[}aOR] = 1.36, 95\%CI:1.11-1.68, P =
   0.003 per 5-years older) and comorbidity (aOR = 1.49, 95\%CI:1.27-1.75,
   P < 0.001 per additional comorbidity) were associated with greater
   likelihood of nephrologist-perceived frailty. Being non-African American
   was associated with greater likelihood of NP- (aOR = 5.51,
   95\%CI:3.21-9.48, P = 0.003) and patient- (aOR = 4.20, 95\%CI:1.61-10.9,
   P = 0.003) perceived frailty. Percent agreement between perceived and
   measured frailty was poor (nephrologist, NP, and patient: 64.1\%,
   67.0\%, and 55.5\%). Among non-frail participants, 34.4\%, 30.0\%, and
   31.6\% were perceived as frail by a nephrologist, NP, or themselves.
   Older adults (P < 0.001) were more likely to be misclassified as frail
   by a nephrologist; women (P = 0.04) and non-African Americans (P = 0.02)
   were more likely to be misclassified by an NP. Neither age, sex, nor
   race was associated with patient misclassification.
   Conclusions: Perceived frailty is an inadequate proxy for measured
   frailty among patients undergoing hemodialysis.}},

Abstract = {{Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin indicated for in-hospital
   treatment of severe infections. Acute neurotoxicity, an increasingly
   recognized adverse effect of this drug in an overdose, predominantly
   affects patients with reduced renal function. Although dialytic
   approaches have been advocated to treat this condition, their role in
   this indication remains unclear. We report the case of an 88-year-old
   female patient with impaired renal function who developed
   life-threatening neurologic symptoms during cefepime therapy. She was
   treated with two intermittent 3-hour high-flux, high-efficiency
   hemodialysis sessions. Serial pre-, post-, and peridialytic (pre- and
   postfilter) serum cefepime concentrations were measured. Pharmacokinetic
   modeling showed that this dialytic strategy allowed for serum cefepime
   concentrations to return to the estimated nontoxic range 15 hours
   earlier than would have been the case without an intervention. The
   patient made a full clinical recovery over the next 48 hours. We
   conclude that at least 1 session of intermittent hemodialysis may
   shorten the time to return to the nontoxic range in severe clinically
   patent intoxication. It should be considered early in its clinical
   course pending chemical confirmation, even in frail elderly patients.
   Careful dosage adjustment and a high index of suspicion are essential in

Abstract = {{Background. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose
   reduction or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead
   to rejection and possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known
   about what factors might cause or contribute to MDR. Frailty, a measure
   of physiologic reserve, is emerging as an important, novel domain of
   risk in kidney transplantation recipients. We hypothesized that frailty,
   an inflammatory phenotype, might be associated with MDR. Methods. We
   measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical
   activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor
   characteristics, longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 kidney
   transplantation recipients. Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted
   Cox proportional hazards model. Results. By 2 years after
   transplantation, 54\% of frail recipients and 45\% of nonfrail
   recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67\% and 51\%.
   Frail recipients were 1.29 times (95\% confidence interval {[}95\% CI],
   1.01-1.66; P = 0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased
   donor recipients (adjusted hazard ratio {[}aHR], 1.92; 95\% CI,

   independently associated with a substantially increased risk of

Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: The usage of nursing home (NH) services is a marker of
   frailty among older adults. Although the Centers for Medicare \&
   Medicaid Services (CMS) revised the Medical Evidence Report Form
   CMS-2728 in 2005 to include data collection on NH institutionalization,
   the validity of this item has not been reported.
   Methods: There were 27,913 patients >= 75 years of age with incident
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 2006, which constituted our analysis
   cohort. We determined the accuracy of the CMS-2728 using a matched
   cohort that included the CMS Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0, often employed
   as a ``gold standard{''} metric for identifying patients receiving NH
   care. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value
   (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the CMS-2728 NH item.
   Next, we compared characteristics and mortality risk by CMS-2728 and MDS
   NH status agreement.
   Results: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the CMS-2728 for
   NH status were 33\%, 97\%, 80\% and 79\%, respectively. Compared to
   those without the MDS or CMS-2728 NH indicator (No MDS/No 2728),
   multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95\% confidence interval) for
   mortality associated with NH status were 1.55 (1.46 - 1.64) for
   MDS/2728, 1.48 (1.42 - 1.54) for MDS/No 2728, and 1.38 (1.25 - 1.52) for
   No MDS/2728. NH utilization was more strongly associated with mortality
   than other CMS-2728 items in the model.
   Conclusions: The CMS-2728 underestimated NH utilization among older
   adults with incident ESRD. The potential for misclassification may have
   important ramifications for assessing prognosis, developing advanced
   care plans and providing coordinated care.}},

Abstract = {{A chronic disease in older adults usually runs a course that is less
   predictable than in younger individuals. Unexplained variations in
   disease incidence, prognosis, therapeutic responses, and toxicity are
   frequently observed among older adults. This heterogeneity poses huge
   challenges to the current one-size-fits-all health care systems, and
   calls for more personalized managements of chronic diseases in older
   adults. Aging is characterized by progressive deterioration of bodily
   functions with increasing risk of failure over time. The entire process
   is hierarchically organized, and progresses from intracellular events to
   changes at systemic and ultimately organism levels at different rates
   among different individuals. Aging biology exerts great influences on
   the development and progression of most age-related chronic diseases.
   Thus, aging biology could contribute to the complexity of illnesses that
   increase with age, and aging biomarkers possess a great potential to
   enable personalized health risk assessment and health care. We review
   evidences supporting the roles of aging biomarkers in risk assessment of
   prevalent age-related diseases. Frailty phenotype is an objectively
   measured indicator of advanced-stage aging that is characterized by
   organism-level dysfunction. In contrast, altered inflammation markers
   level signifies an earlier stage between cellular abnormalities and
   systems dysfunction. Results of human observational studies and
   randomized controlled trials indicate that these measures, albeit
   simple, greatly facilitate classification of older patients with cancer,
   chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes
   mellitus into groups that vary in disease incidence, prognosis and
   therapeutic response/toxicity. As the detailed mechanisms underlying the
   complex biologic process of aging are unraveled in the future, a larger
   array of biomarkers that correlate with biologic aging at different
   stages will be discovered. Following the translational research
   framework described in this article, these research efforts would result
   in innovations in disease prevention and management that address the
   huge unmet health needs of aging populations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Patients with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high
   morbidity, mortality, and symptom burden. Cardiovascular disease (CVD)
   and congestive heart failure (CHF) often contribute to these burdens and
   should be considered when providing recommendations for care. This
   review aims to summarize recent literature relevant to the provision of
   palliative and end-of-life care for patients with progressive CKD and
   specifically highlights issues relevant to those with CVD and CHF.
   Recent findings
   Dialysis may not benefit older, frail patients with progressive CKD,
   especially those with other comorbidities. Patients managed
   conservatively (i.e., without dialysis) may live as long as patients who
   elect to start dialysis, with better preservation of function and
   quality of life and with fewer acute care admissions. Decisions
   regarding dialysis initiation should be made on an individual basis,
   keeping in mind each patient's goals, comorbidities, and underlying
   functional status. Conservative management of progressive kidney disease
   is frequently not offered but is likely to benefit many older, frail
   patients with comorbidities such as CHF and CVD.
   Summary
   A palliative approach to the care of many patients with progressive CKD
   is essential to ensuring they receive appropriate quality care.}},

Title = {{Association of lead and cadmium exposure with frailty in US older adults}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{424-431}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Environmental lead and cadmium exposure is associated with
   higher risk of several age-related chronic diseases, including
   cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis. These
   diseases may lead to frailty, a geriatric syndrome characterized by
   diminished physiologic reserve in multiple systems with decreased
   ability to cope with acute stressors. However, no previous study has
   evaluated the association between lead or cadmium exposure and frailty.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study among individuals aged >= 60 years who
   participated in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey and had either blood lead (N=5272) or urine cadmium (N=4887)
   determinations. Frailty was ascertained with a slight modification of
   the Fried criteria, so that individuals meeting >= 3 of 5 pre-defined
   criteria (exhaustion, low body weight, low physical activity, weakness
   and slow walking speed), were considered as frail. The association
   between lead and cadmium with frailty was evaluated using logistic
   regression with adjustment for relevant confounders.
   Results: Median (intertertile range) concentrations of blood lead and
   urine cadmium were 3.9 mu g/dl (2.9-4.9) and 0.62 mu g/l (0.41-0.91),
   respectively. The prevalence of frailty was 7.1\%. The adjusted odds
   ratios (95\% confidence interval) of frailty comparing the second and
   third to the lowest tertile of blood lead were, respectively, 1.40
   (0.96-2.04) and 1.75 (1.33-2.31). Lead concentrations were also
   associated with the frequency of exhaustion, weakness and slowness. The
   corresponding odds ratios (95\% confidence interval) for cadmium were,
   respectively, 0.97 (0.68-1.39) and 1.55 (1.03-2.32), but this
   association did not hold after excluding participants with reduced
   glomerular filtration rate: 0.70 (0.43-1.14) and 1.09 (0.56-2.11),
   respectively.
   Conclusions: In the US older adult population, blood lead but not urine
   cadmium concentrations showed a direct dose-response relationship with
   frailty. These findings support that lead exposure increases frailty in
   older adults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm
   disorder, which can potentially increases the risk of stroke by
   five-fold, thus, resulting in high public healthcare burden. Stroke
   prevention is vital in the management of AF patients. Vitamin K
   antagonists (VKA, eg, warfarin) have been the mainstay treatment to
   prevent ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism in AF patients for
   several decades. Despite the efficacy of warfarin, its limitations have
   recently driven the advent of some new antithrombotic agents, the
   non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOACs, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban,
   apixaban, and edoxaban). The NOACs have changed the landscape for
   thromboembolic prophylaxis among patients with nonvalvular AF. Although
   three NOACs thus far (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) have been
   approved in Europe and the United States, for stroke prevention in
   patients with nonvalvular AF on the basis of several Phase III clinical
   trials, warfarin still remain important in preventing stroke for
   patients. This is especially true for those with optimal control of
   international normalized ratio with high (>70 \%) time in therapeutic
   range, valvular AF or associated prosthetic valve. These NOACs are
   attractive alternatives for stroke prevention in patients with
   nonvalvular AF who are unable or unwilling to receive warfarin. However,
   several issues should be taken into consideration on safe and effective
   use of these NOACs in day-today clinical practice, for example,
   pharmacological properties, drug interactions, monitoring and
   compliance, and treatment of frail elderly patients or patients with
   renal impairment, etc. The decision about whether to initiate oral
   anticoagulation either with warfarin or NOACs should be patient-centered
   and after consideration of both stroke and bleeding risks. It is
   important for clinical practitioner to offer patients with AF an
   individualized decision about drug choice, making decision after
   adequate patient education plus discussion about the risks and benefits
   of these agents, thus fitting the drug to the patient profile.}},

Journal = {{NEPHROLOGY DIALYSIS TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background. Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease
   (ESKD). Because of conflicting results in observational studies, it is
   still subject to debate whether in diabetic patients the dialysis
   modality selected as first treatment (haemodialysis or peritoneal
   dialysis) may have a major impact on outcomes. We therefore aimed at
   performing a systematic review of the available evidence.
   Methods. MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched until
   February 2014 for English-language articles without time or methodology
   restrictions by highly sensitive search strategies focused on diabetes,
   end-stage kidney disease and dialysis modality. Selection of relevant
   studies, data extraction and analysis were performed by two independent
   reviewers.
   Results. Twenty-five observational studies (23 on incident and 2 on
   prevalent cohorts) were included in this review. Mortality was the only
   main outcome addressed in large cohorts. When considering patient
   survival, results were inconsistent and varied across study designs,
   follow-up period and subgroups. We therefore found no evidence-based
   arguments in favour or against a particular dialysis modality as first
   choice treatment in patients with diabetes and ESKD. However, peritoneal
   dialysis (PD) as first choice seems to convey a higher risk of death in
   elderly and frail patients.
   Conclusions. The available evidence derived from observational studies
   is inconsistent. Therefore evidence-based arguments indicating that HD
   or PD as first treatment may improve patient-centred outcomes in
   diabetics with ESKD are lacking. In the absence of such evidence,
   modality selection should be governed by patient preference, after
   unbiased patient information.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The dialysis population is aging worldwide. It is well known
   that patients on dialysis have limited functional status, but only
   recently has frailty been considered. Summary: The prevalence of frailty
   among patients on dialysis ranges from 3.4-to 10-fold higher than among
   community- dwelling elderly, depending on the method of assessing
   frailty and patient characteristics. Despite its high prevalence and the
   high overall mortality in the dialysis population, frailty is associated
   with higher mortality, independent of clinical and demographic
   characteristics and comorbidity. The prevalence of frailty among
   patients with nondialysis- dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) is
   also high, and cross-sectional data suggest that the prevalence may
   increase as CKD progresses. Thus, interventions to improve frailty have
   the potential to improve quality of life and mortality. Although
   interventions to improve physical dysfunction have been successful in
   the population with end-stage renal disease, no studies have
   specifically targeted frail individuals. Therefore, the extent to which
   exercise or physical activity interventions are feasible among frail
   patients and can improve frailty urgently needs to be examined. In the
   meantime, providers should refer frail patients to physical therapists
   and encourage them to be more active if possible. In addition, more
   attention should be focused on the possibility that rehabilitation among
   patients with earlier stages of CKD could improve dialysis outcomes. Key
   Messages: Frailty is extremely common among patients on dialysis and is
   independently associated with adverse outcomes. Providers should take
   advantage of available resources to improve functioning in this
   population, and research should address the optimal strategy for
   addressing frailty, including timing of intervention. (C) 2015 S. Karger

Abstract = {{Peritoneal dialysis is troubled with declining utilisation as a form of

   The best evidence to repopulate PD programmes is provided for the
   positive impact of timely referral and systematic and motivational

Abstract = {{Background: Although frailty has been linked to higher risk of falls and
   fracture in the general population, only few studies have examined the
   extent to which frailty is associated with these outcomes among patients
   with end-stage renal disease, who are at particularly high risk for
   these events. Methods: A total of 1,646 patients who were beginning
   maintenance hemodialysis in 297 dialysis units throughout the United
   States from September 2005 to June 2007 were enrolled in the
   Comprehensive Dialysis Study, and 1,053 Medicare beneficiaries were
   included in this study. Self-reported frailty was defined by the
   patients endorsing 2 or more of the following: poor physical
   functioning, exhaustion or low physical activity. Falls and fractures
   requiring medical attention were identified through Medicare claims
   data. We examined the association between frailty and the time to first
   fall or fracture using the Fine-Gray modification of Cox proportional
   hazards regression, adjusted for demographics, Quetelet's body mass
   index, diabetes mellitus, heart failure and atherosclerosis. Results:
   Seventy-seven percent of patients were frail by self-report. The median

Abstract = {{AimA U-shaped relationship between body mass index (BMI) and all-cause

   associations in Chinese older adults with multiple comorbidities, which
   could provide a reference for the recommended BMI in this population.
   MethodsFrom 2004 to 2013, a retrospective cohort of Chinese older adults
   was selected from a geriatric day hospital in Hong Kong. They were
   divided into groups according to their BMI: BMI <16; BMI 16-18; BMI
   18.1-20; BMI 20.1-22; BMI 22.1-24; BMI 24.1-26; BMI 26.1-28; BMI 28.1-30
   and BMI >30. Other assessments included medical, functional, cognitive,
   social and nutritional assessment.
   ResultsA total of 1747 older adults (mean age 80.87.1 years, 44.1\%
   male, 46.1\% living in nursing homes, Charlson Comorbidity Index 2.0 +/-
   1.6) with a median follow up of 3.5 years were included. Older adults
   with BMI 24-28 had the lowest all-cause, infection-related and
   cardiovascular mortality (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that
   there was an inverted J-shaped association between BMI and hazard ratio

Abstract = {{Objectives: Physical activity questionnaires usually focus on moderate

   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Three dialysis facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area.
   Subjects: Sixty-eight prevalent hemodialysis patients.
   Intervention: We administered a new physical activity questionnaire
   designed to capture activity in the lower end of the range, the Low
   Physical Activity Questionnaire (LoPAQ).
   Main Outcome Measure: Outcome measures were correlation with a validated
   physical activity questionnaire, the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity
   (LTA) questionnaire and with self-reported physical function (physical
   function score of the SF-36) and physical performance (gait speed, chair
   stand, balance, and short physical performance battery). We also
   determined whether patients who were frail or reported limitations in
   activities of daily living were less active on the LoPAQ.
   Results: Sixty-eight participants (mean age 59 +/- 14 years, 59\% men)

   correlated (rho = 0.62, P < .001). In addition, higher physical activity
   measured by the LoPAQ was correlated with better self-reported
   functioning (rho = 0.64, P < .001), better performance on gait speed
   (rho = 0.32, P = .02), balance (rho = 0.45, P < .001), and chair rising

Abstract = {{We have previously described strong associations between frailty, a
   measure of physiologic reserve initially described and validated in
   geriatrics, and early hospital readmission as well as delayed graft
   function. The goal of this study was to estimate its association with
   postkidney transplantation (post-KT) mortality. Frailty was
   prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of
   transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional
   hazards models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to
   substantially improve model efficiency and generalizability in
   single-center studies. We precisely estimated the confounder
   coefficients using the large sample size of the Scientific Registry of
   Transplantation Recipients (n=37 858) and introduced these into the
   single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty
   coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5\%, 86.0\% and 77.5\%
   for nonfrail, intermediately frail and frail KT recipients,
   respectively. Frailty was independently associated with a 2.17-fold
   (95\% CI: 1.01-4.65, p=0.047) higher risk of death. In conclusion,
   regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent risk factor for
   post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many confounders
   using a novel, efficient statistical approach.
   In a prospective, single-center, longitudinal cohort study of kidney
   transplant recipients, the authors find that frailty was a strong
   predictor of mortality, independent of and beyond registry-based
   predictors.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   The population considered eligible for dialysis has expanded
   dramatically over the past 4 decades, so that a significant proportion
   of patients receiving renal replacement therapy are elderly, frail and
   infirm. These patients have an extremely limited life expectancy and
   suffer from significant symptom burden, similar to patients with other
   end-stage organ failure or cancer. As dialysis has been offered more
   broadly, it is now initiated earlier than in decades past, further
   adding to cost and patient burden.
   Recent findings
   The trend toward more expansive and intensive care has not been
   corroborated by robust data. In response, an increasing number of
   studies has focused on establishing reasonable limits to renal
   replacement therapy. Multiple authors have explored the role of
   conservative kidney management for high-risk dialysis patients as an
   alternative to dialysis, which may offer similar survival and improved
   quality of life in certain populations. For those who chose dialysis,
   deferring initiation until the patient becomes symptomatic may be a
   reasonable. Evidence-based symptom management guidelines for dialysis
   patients remain largely absent, with few proven approaches. Hospice and
   palliative care resources remain underutilized.
   Summary
   For a subset of dialysis patients, palliative care and conservative
   kidney management are appropriate and underutilized.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Most studies and national programs aggregate the different
   types of surgical site infections (SSIs) potentially masking and
   misattributing risk. Determining that risk factors for superficial,
   deep, and organ space SSIs are unique is essential to improve SSI rates.
   Methods. This cohort study utilized data of 59,365 patients who
   underwent colon resection at hospitals participating in the American
   College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from
   2007 to 2009. Four independent, multivariable, predictive models were
   developed to assess the unique associations between risk factors and
   each SSI group: Superficial, deep, organ space, and an aggregate of all
   3 types of SSIs.
   Results. Overall, 13\% of colon cases developed SSIs: Superficial (8\%),
   deep (1.4\%), and organ space (3.8\%). Each model was different.
   Morbidly obese patients were more likely to develop SSIs than normal
   weight patients across all models; however, risk factors common to all
   models (eg, body mass index {[}BMI], duration of operation, wound class,
   laparoscopic approach) had very different levels of risk. Unique risks
   for superficial SSIs include diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease, and dyspnea. Deep SSIs had the greatest magnitude of
   association with BMI and the greatest incidence of wound disruption
   (19.8\%). Organ space SSIs were often owing to anastomotic leaks and
   were uniquely associated with disseminated cancer, preoperative
   dialysis, preoperative radiation treatment, and a bleeding disorder,
   suggesting a physically frail or compromised patient may put the
   anastomosis at risk.
   Conclusion. Risk factors for superficial, deep, and organ space SSI
   differ. More effective prevention strategies may be developed by
   reporting and examining each type of SSI separately.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A well-accepted definition of frailty includes measurements
   of physical performance, which may limit its clinical utility.
   Study Design: In a cross-sectional study, we compared prevalence and
   patient characteristics based on a frailty definition that uses
   self-reported function to the classic performance-based definition and
   developed a modified self-report-based definition.
   Setting \& Participants: Prevalent adult patients receiving hemodialysis
   in 14 centers around San Francisco and Atlanta in 2009-2011.
   Index Tests: Self-report-based frailty definition in which a score lower
   than 75 on the Physical Function scale of the 36-Item Short Form Health
   Survey (SF-36) was substituted for gait speed and grip strength in the
   classic definition; modified self-report definition with optimized
   Physical Function score cutoff points derived in a development
   (one-half) cohort and validated in the other half.
   Reference Test: Performance-based frailty defined as 3 of the following:
   weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait
   speed.
   Results: 387 (53\%) patients were frail based on self-reported function,
   of whom 209 (29\% of the cohort) met the performance-based definition.
   Only 23 (3\%) met the performance-based definition of frailty only. The
   self-report definition had 90\% sensitivity, 64\% specificity, 54\%
   positive predictive value, 93\% negative predictive value, and 72.5\%
   overall accuracy. Intracellular water per kilogram of body weight and
   serum albumin, prealbumin, and creatinine levels were highest among
   nonfrail individuals, intermediate among those who were frail by
   self-report, and lowest among those who also were frail by performance.
   Age, percentage of body fat, and C-reactive protein level followed an
   opposite pattern. The modified self-report definition had better
   accuracy (84\%; 95\% CI, 79\%-89\%) and superior specificity (88\%) and
   positive predictive value (67\%).
   Limitations: Our study did not address prediction of outcomes.
   Conclusions: Patients who meet the self-report-based but not the
   performance-based definition of frailty may represent an intermediate

   a questionnaire-based method of defining frailty. Published by Elsevier

   Methods: Seven hundred forty-five patients undergoing

Abstract = {{Today, old age does not represent a formal contraindication to kidney
   transplantation. Rather, there is evidence that in elderly patients
   renal transplantation offers longer life expectancy and better quality
   of life in comparison with dialysis. Yet, the results of renal
   transplantation in recipients older than 65 years are inferior to those
   observed in younger adults, death with functioning graft representing a
   major cause of failure. Therefore, the selection of aged patients is of
   paramount importance. Apart from the routine clinical and biological
   investigations, three aspects have been relatively neglected by the
   transplant community and may require a careful analysis in elderly
   candidates to transplantation: the presence and degree of frailty, the
   presence of comorbidities and the adherence to prescriptions. Although
   there are rapid and simple tests for assessing the degree of frailty in
   the elderly, there is no clear cut-off value to decide whether a patient
   should be accepted or not. With advanced age the prevalence and severity
   of cardiovascular events and other diseases tend to increase. The use of
   combined age-comorbidity indices may be helpful to identify patients at
   high risk of mortality. Another critical point is the poor unintentional
   adherence to treatment, often caused by forgetfulness and mild cognitive
   impairment. These drawbacks may be further enhanced by a high number of
   pills to take and by changes in the dosage or type of prescriptions. A
   careful screening of the presence and degree of frailty, comorbidity and
   poor compliance to treatment is highly recommended before admitting
   older candidates to the waiting list for transplantation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The purpose of this cross-sectional prospective study was to determine
   the prevalence of anemia among elderly hospitalized patients in Germany
   and to investigate its association with multidimensional loss of
   function (MLF). One hundred participants aged 70 years or older from two
   distinct wards (50 each from an emergency department and a medical ward,
   respectively) underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA)
   consisting of the following six tools: Barthel Index, mini-mental state
   examination, clock-drawing test, timed up and go test, Esslinger
   transfer scale, and Daniels test. MLF as an aggregated outcome was
   diagnosed when three or more tests of the CGA showed an abnormal result.
   Anemia was defined according to WHO criteria as a hemoglobin (Hb)
   concentration of < 13 g/dL for men and < 12 g/dL for women. The
   prevalence of anemia was 60 \%. Overall, 61 \% of patients presented
   with three or more abnormal results in the six tests of the CGA and,
   thus, with MLF. Using logistic regression, we found a significant
   association of both anemia and low Hb concentrations with abnormal
   outcomes in five tests of the CGA and, therefore, with domain-specific
   deficits like mobility limitations, impaired cognition, and dysphagia.
   Furthermore, being anemic increased the odds of featuring MLF more than
   fourfold. This significant relationship persisted after adjustment for
   various major comorbidities. Both anemia and geriatric conditions are
   common in the hospitalized elderly. Given the association of anemia with
   MLF, Hb level might serve as a useful geriatric screening marker to
   identify frail older people at risk for adverse outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Context. There are few data on the frequency and current management of
   clinical ethical issues related to care of seriously ill dialysis
   patients in free-standing dialysis facilities.
   Objectives. To examine the extent of clinical ethical challenges
   experienced by care providers in free-standing facilities and their
   perceptions about how those issues are managed.
   Methods. A total of 183 care providers recruited from 15 facilities in
   North Carolina completed a survey regarding the occurrence and
   management of ethical issues in the past year. Care plan meetings were
   observed at four of the facilities for three consecutive months. Also,
   current policies and procedures at each of the facilities were reviewed.
   Results. The two most frequently experienced challenges involved
   dialyzing frail patients with multiple comorbidities and caring for
   disruptive/difficult patients. The most common ways of managing ethical
   issues were discussions in care plan meetings (n = 47) or discussions
   with the clinic manager (n = 47). Although policies were in place to
   guide management of some of the challenges, respondents were often not
   aware of those policies. Also, although participants reported that
   ethical issues related to dialyzing undocumented immigrants were fairly
   common, no facility had a policy for managing this challenge.
   Participants suggested that all staff obtain training in clinical ethics
   and communication skills, facilities develop ethics teams, and there be
   clear policies to guide management of ethical challenges.
   Conclusion. The scope of ethical challenges was extensive, how these
   challenges were managed varied widely, and there were limited resources
   for assistance. Multifaceted efforts, encompassing endeavors at the
   individual, facility, organization, and national levels, are needed to
   support staff in improving the management of ethical challenges in

Abstract = {{Adverse drug effects as a consequence of inappropriate dosage are a
   common cause of hospitalization among the elderly. Older individuals are
   at a particular risk of overdosing because their kidney function
   decreases with advancing age and the elderly are often prescribed
   several pharmaceutical drugs. In addition, serum creatinine levels
   decrease owing to a reduction in muscle mass with age. Therefore, drug
   dosing based on the serum creatinine level only, instead of using
   assessment of the renal function, may result in overdosing of frail
   elderly patients. Renal function, i.e., the glomerular filtration rate
   can, with simple formulas, be estimated from analysis of creatinine
   and/or plasma cystatin C (eGFR). Such estimations performed with modern
   and validated formulas, as a rule present renal function normalized to
   the body surface area (mL/min/1.73 m(2)). A good estimation of how much
   the normal dosing interval should be prolonged, or the dose reduced, to
   obtain a desired plasma concentration of drugs that are mainly
   eliminated by glomerular filtration can be obtained by calculating the
   ratio between the patient's eGFR and the normal renal function (about
   90-125 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Increased knowledge and use of eGFR by
   prescribing physicians will reduce the risk of overdosing drugs in the

Abstract = {{The equations for estimating kidney function have become very popular in
   the last decade. However, the clinical and prognostic meaning of these
   measures may be very different in older populations. Two cohorts of
   people aged 65-89 years (older sample) and 90 or more (oldest old
   sample) were used to investigate the prognostic significance of
   estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Additionally, we also
   investigated whether combining frailty and eGFR may improve the accuracy
   of frailty in predicting mortality. We found that lower eGFR values were
   significantly more frequent among frail subjects in both groups. eGFR<30
   was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality either in
   subjects aged 6589 years (HR=3.71, 95\% CI=1.23-11.2) or in those aged
   90 or more (HR=1.53, 95\% CI=1.05-2.23). In the latter group, a not
   significant trend for increasing mortality was also observed among
   people with eGFR>60 (HR=1.28, 95\% CI=0.72-2.26). In addition, the
   oldest old subjects with eGFR>60 and eGFR<30 had the lowest hand-grip
   strength and ADL values. Combining eGFR and frailty status significantly
   improved the accuracy of frailty in predicting mortality only in the
   older sample. In conclusion, a U-shaped relationship exists between eGFR
   and mortality in the oldest old, but not in older individuals. Our
   findings suggest that eGFR needs to be adjusted for muscle mass/physical
   performance when estimating kidney function in people aged 90 or more.
   Nevertheless, in subjects aged 65-89 years, eGFR may improve the
   accuracy of frailty status in predicting prognosis, thus suggesting that
   eGFR may represent an additional dimension of frailty syndrome.}},

Title = {{Fluoroscopic versus Laparoscopic Implantation of Peritoneal Dialysis
   Catheters: A Retrospective Cohort Study}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: A previous clinical trial showed that radiologic insertion of
   first peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters by modified Seldinger technique
   is noninferior to laparoscopic surgery in patients at low risk in a
   clinical trial setting. The present cohort study was performed to
   confirm clinical effectiveness of radiologic insertion in everyday
   practice, including insertion in patients with expanded eligibility
   criteria and by fellows in training.
   Materials and Methods: Between 2004 and 2009, 286 PD catheters were
   inserted in 249 patients, 133 with fluoroscopic guidance in the
   radiology department and 153 by laparoscopic surgery. Survival analyses
   were performed with the primary outcome of complication-free catheter
   survival and secondary outcomes of overall catheter survival and patient
   survival. Outcomes were assessed at last follow-up, as long as 365 days
   after PD catheter insertion.
   Results: In the radiologic group, unadjusted 365-day complication-free
   catheter, overall catheter, and patient survival rates were 22.6\%,
   81.2\%, and 82.7\%, respectively, compared with 22.9\% (P = .52), 76.5\%
   (P = .4), and 92.8\% (P = .01, respectively, in the laparoscopic group.
   Frequencies of individual complications were similar between groups.
   Adjusting for patient age, comorbidity, and previous PD catheter, the
   hazard ratio (HR) for catheter complications by radiologic versus
   laparoscopic insertion is 0.90 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   0.62-1.31); the HR for overall catheter survival is 1.25 (95\% CI,
   0.59-2.65); and that for death is 2.47 (95\% CI, 0.84-7.3).
   Conclusions: Radiologic PD catheter insertion is a clinically effective
   alternative to laparoscopic surgery, although there wag poorer long-term
   Survival with radiologic Catheter placement, possibly because of
   preferential selection of radiologic insertion for more frail patients.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The ability of nursing home residents to function
   independently is associated with their quality of life. The impact of
   amputations on functional status in this population remains unclear.
   This analysis evaluated the effect of amputations-transmetatarsal (TM),
   below-knee (BK), and above-knee (AK)-on the ability of residents to
   perform self-care activities.
   Methods: Medicare inpatient claims were linked with nursing home
   assessment data to identify admissions for amputation. The Minimum Data
   Set Activities of Daily Living Long Form Score (0-28; higher numbers
   indicating greater impairment), based on seven activities of daily
   living, was calculated before and after amputation. Hierarchical
   modeling determined the effect of the surgery on postamputation function
   of residents. Controlling for comorbidity, cognition, and prehospital
   function allowed for evaluation of Activities of Daily Living
   trajectories over time.
   Results: In total, 4965 residents underwent amputation: 490 TM, 1596 BK,
   and 2879 AK. Mean age was 81 years, and 54\% of the patients were women.
   Most were white (67\%) or black (26.5\%). Comorbidities before
   amputation included diabetes mellitus (70.7\%), coronary heart disease
   (57.1\%), chronic kidney disease (53.6\%), and/or congestive heart
   failure (52.1\%). Mortality within 30 days of hospital discharge was
   9.0\%, and hospital readmission was 27.7\%. Stroke, end-stage renal
   disease, and poor baseline cognitive function were associated with the
   poorest functional outcome after amputation. Compared with residents who
   received TM amputation, those who had BK or AK amputation recovered more
   slowly and failed to return to baseline function by 6 months. BK was
   found to have a superior functional trajectory compared with AK.
   Conclusions: Elderly nursing home residents undergoing BK or AK
   amputation failed to return to their functional baseline within 6
   months. Among frail elderly nursing home residents, higher amputation
   level, stroke, end-stage renal disease, poor baseline cognitive scores,
   and female sex were associated with inferior functional status after
   amputation. These factors should be strongly assessed to maintain
   activities of daily living and quality of life in the nursing home
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in
   individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important
   impacts on their quality of life and overall health. This review
   summarizes the burden of cognitive and physical impairment in CKD,
   focusing on recent research that highlights a possible unifying
   microvascular cause among these shared comorbid conditions.
   Recent findings
   Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating cognitive
   and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
   demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD,
   including microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive
   impairment. Additionally, studies demonstrate that physical function is
   substantially worse than expected in individuals with CKD, that
   decreased physical activity is associated with worse outcomes, that
   frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk of death,
   and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible short-term
   effects on markers of physical performance.
   Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
   factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is
   necessary to better treat these important comorbid conditions in people
   with CKD.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In recent years, the End-Stage Kidney Disease population has
   increased and is ever more frail, elderly and co-morbid. A care-focused
   approach needs to be incorporated alongside the disease focus, to
   identify those who are deteriorating and improve communication about
   preferences and future care. Yet many renal professionals feel
   unprepared for such discussions.
   Aim: To develop and pilot a REnal specific Advanced Communication
   Training (REACT) programme to address the needs of End-Stage Kidney
   Disease patients and renal professionals.
   Design: Two-part study: (1) development of the REnal specific Advanced
   Communication Training programme informed by multi-professional focus
   group and patient survey and (2) piloting of the programme.
   Setting/participants: The REnal specific Advanced Communication Training
   programme was piloted with 16 participants (9 renal nurses/health-care
   assistants and 7 renal consultants) in two UK teaching hospitals.
   Results: The focus group identified the need for better information
   about end-of-life phase, improved awareness of patient perspectives,
   skills to manage challenging discussions, hands on' practice in a safe
   environment and follow-up to discuss experiences. The patient survey
   demonstrated a need to improve communication about concerns, treatment
   plans and decisions. The developed REnal specific Advanced Communication
   Training programme was acceptable and feasible and was associated with a
   non-significant increase in confidence in communicating about
   end-of-life issues (pre-training: 6.6/10, 95\% confidence interval:
   5.7-7.4; post-training: 6.9/10, 95\% confidence interval: 6.1-7.7,
   unpaired t-test - p = 0.56), maintained at 3 months.
   Conclusion: There is a need to improve end-of-life care for End-Stage
   Kidney Disease patients, to enable them to make informed decisions about
   future care. Challenges include prioritising communication training
   among service providers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces frailty and worsens
   quality of life (QOL), even in the early stages of the disease and in
   young patients. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the
   relationship between frailty and QOL in CKD patients. Thus, we
   investigated this relationship in a sample of CKD patients.
   Methods: A cross-observational study was conducted, in which 61 CKD
   patients receiving pre-dialysis treatment were assessed. All
   participants completed the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used
   valid and reliable methods to classify subjects as frail or non-frail
   according to Johansen's et al. (2007) criteria. A one-way analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used to compare the groups.
   In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to measure
   associations between identified variables and frailty. We also performed
   simple linear regression using the SF-36 physical and mental composite
   scores.
   Results: Almost half of the sample (42.6\%) exhibited evidence of
   frailty. The groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, and
   all SF-36 domains, excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional.
   Frailty was significantly associated with all SF-36 domains, again
   excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Regression analysis
   revealed no significant between-group differences in composite physical
   and mental health scores generated by the SF-36 (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Frail and non-frail CKD patients differed significantly in
   seven of the eight SF-36 domains. The frail group displayed diminished
   physical and mental functioning when their SF-36 scores were divided by
   their physical and mental composite scores. Frailty was correlated with
   QOL domains, with the exception of the social domain. There is a need
   for interventions targeting the characteristics of frailty, to provide
   better treatment and optimize overall QOL.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of frailty among patients on hemodialysis have relied on
   definitions that substitute self-reported functioning for measures of
   physical performance and omit weight loss or substitute alternate
   criteria. We examined the association between body composition and a
   definition of frailty that includes measured physical performance and
   weight loss in a cross-sectional analysis of 638 adult patients
   receiving maintenance hemodialysis at 14 centers. Frailty was defined as
   having three of following characteristics: weight loss, weakness,
   exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed. We performed
   logistic regression with body mass index (BMI) and bioelectrical
   impedance spectroscopy (BIS)-derived estimates of intracellular water
   (ICW), fat mass, and extracellular water (ECW) as the main predictors,
   and age, sex, race, and comorbidity as covariates. Overall, 30\% of
   participants were frail. Older age (odds ratio {[}OR], 1.31 per 10
   years; 95\% confidence interval {[}95\% CI], 1.14 to 1.50), diabetes
   (OR, 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.13 to 2.40), higher fat mass (OR, 1.18; 95\% CI,
   1.02 to 1.37), and higher ECW(OR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.20 to 1.47)
   associated with higher odds of frailty. Higher ICW associated with lower
   odds of frailty (OR, 0.80 per kg; 95\% CI, 0.73 to 0.87). The addition
   of BMI data did not change the area under the receiver operating
   characteristics curve (AUC; AUC=0.66 versus 0.66; P=0.71), but the
   addition of BIS data did change the AUC (AUC=0.72; P < 0.001). Thus,
   individual components of body composition but not BMI associate strongly
   with frailty in this cohort of patients receiving hemodialysis.}},

Abstract = {{Frailty in the elderly is a state of vulnerability to poor resolution of
   homoeostasis after a stressor event and is a consequence of cumulative
   decline in many physiological systems during a lifetime. This cumulative
   decline depletes homoeostatic reserves until minor stressor events
   trigger disproportionate changes in health status. It is usually
   associated to adverse health outcomes and to one-year mortality risk.
   Physical exercise has found to be effective in preventing frailty and
   disability in this population. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a
   clinical condition where protein energy-wasting, sarcopenia and
   dynapenia, very common symptoms in the frail elderly, may occur.
   Moreover elderly and CKD patients are both affected by an impaired
   physical performance that may be reversed by physical exercise with an
   improvement of the survival rate. These similarities suggest that
   frailty may be a common pathway of aging and CKD that may induce
   disability and that can be prevented by a multidimensional approach in
   which physical exercise plays an important role.}},

   increased risk of functional impairment, independent of age, gender, and

   functional impairments, the traditional disease based model should be
   changed to individualized patient-centered approach that prioritizes

   considerably lower exercise tolerance, functional capacity, and more
   muscle wasting than healthy subjects or patients with less severe CKD.

Abstract = {{Needing assistance with activities of daily living (ADL) is an early
   indicator of functional decline and has important implications for
   individuals' quality of life. However, correlates of need for ADL
   assistance have received limited attention among patients undergoing
   maintenance hemodialysis (HD). A multicenter cohort of 742 prevalent HD
   patients was assessed in 2009-2011 and classified as frail, prefrail and
   nonfrail by the Fried frailty index (recent unintentional weight loss,
   reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk speed, low physical
   activity). Patients reported need for assistance with 4 ADL tasks and
   identified contributing symptoms/conditions (pain, balance, endurance,
   weakness, others). Nearly 1 in 5 patients needed assistance with 1 or
   more ADL. Multivariable analysis showed increased odds for needing ADL
   assistance among frail (odds ratio {[}OR] 11.35; 95\% confidence

   stroke. Balance, weakness, and ``other{''} (frequently dialysis-related)
   symptoms/conditions were the most frequently named reasons for ADL
   difficulty. In addition to interventions such as increasing physical

Abstract = {{Background: Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults but is
   underrecognized and undertreated. The approach to pain assessment and
   management in older adults requires an understanding of the physiology
   of aging, validated assessment tools, and common pain presentations
   among older adults.
   Objective: To identify the overall principles of pain management in
   older adults with a specific focus on common painful conditions and
   approaches to pharmacologic treatment.
   Methods: We searched PubMed for common pain presentations in older
   adults with heart failure, end-stage renal disease, dementia, frailty,
   and cancer. We also reviewed guidelines for pain management. Our review
   encompassed 2 guidelines, 10 original studies, and 22 review articles
   published from 2000 to the present. This review does not discuss
   nonpharmacologic treatments of pain.
   Results: Clinical guidelines support the use of opioids in persistent
   nonmalignant pain. Opioids should be used in patients with moderate or
   severe pain or pain not otherwise controlled but with careful attention
   to potential toxic effects and half-life. In addition, clinical practice
   guidelines recommend use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
   with extreme caution and for defined, limited periods.
   Conclusion: An understanding of the basics of pain pathophysiology,
   assessment, pharmacologic management, and a familiarity with common pain
   presentations will allow clinicians to effectively manage pain for older
   adults. (C) 2013 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Frailty is a physiologic state of increased vulnerability to stressors
   that results from decreased physiologic reserves or dysregulation of
   multiple physiologic systems. The construct of frailty has been
   operationalized as a composite of poor physical function, exhaustion,
   low physical activity, and weight loss. Several studies have now
   examined the prevalence of frailty among chronic kidney disease (CKD) or
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and have found frailty to be
   more common among individuals with CKD than among those without.
   Furthermore, frailty is associated with adverse outcomes among incident
   dialysis patients, including higher risk of hospitalization and death.
   Recent evidence shows that frail patients are started on dialysis
   earlier (at a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate {[}eGFR]) on
   average than nonfrail patients, but it remains unclear whether these
   patients' frailty is a result of uremia or is independent of CKD. The
   survival disadvantage that has been associated with early initiation of
   dialysis in observational studies could be mediated in part through
   confounding on the basis of unmeasured frailty. However, available data
   do not suggest improvement in frailty upon initiation of dialysis;
   rather, the trajectory appears to be toward higher levels of dependence
   in activities of daily living (ADLs) after dialysis initiation. Overall,
   there are no data to suggest that frail patients derive any benefit from
   early initiation of dialysis either in the form of improved survival or
   functional status.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of reviewDespite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of

   present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic cohorts

   functioning are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical

   Low physical performance and activity limitations are more prevalent in
   patients with CKD, regardless of age, compared to older

   should strongly motivate a focus of treatment on assessing and improving
   physical activity and physical function as part of routine
   patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical activity
   interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of
   age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that

Abstract = {{Increasing numbers of frail elderly with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
   and multiple comorbidities are undertaking dialysis treatment. This has
   been accompanied by increasing dialysis withdrawal, thus warranting
   investigation into why this is occurring and whether a different
   approach to choosing treatment should be implemented. Despite being a
   potentially life-saving treatment, the physical and psychosocial burdens
   associated with dialysis in the frail elderly usually outweigh the
   benefits of correcting uraemia. Conservative management is less invasive
   and avoids the adverse effects associated with dialysis, but
   unfortunately it is often not properly considered until patients
   withdraw from dialysis. Shared decision-making has been proposed to
   allow patients active participation in healthcare decisions. Through
   this approach, patients will focus on their personal values to receive
   appropriate treatment, and perhaps opt for conservative management. This
   may help address the issue of dialysis withdrawal. Moreover, shared
   decision-making attempts to resolve the conflict between autonomy and
   other ethical principles, including physician paternalism. Here, we
   explore the ethical background behind shared decision-making, and
   whether it is genuinely in the patients best interests or whether it is
   a cynical solution to encourage more patients to consider conservative
   care, thus saving limited resources.}},

Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in
   physical function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty,
   such as weakness and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic
   kidney disease (CKD). The increased vulnerability of frail patients with
   coexisting CKD may place them at a heightened risk of encountering
   additional health complications. The purpose of this systematic review
   was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical outcomes.
   Methods: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the
   general population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed,
   Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association
   between frailty and CKD and those relating frailty in patients with CKD
   to clinical outcomes.
   Results: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full
   text review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical
   function to CKD. From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that
   related frailty in patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was
   consistently associated with increasing frailty or reduced physical
   function {[}odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. In patients with CKD,
   frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher risk of
   dialysis and/or death {[}OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
   Conclusions: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or
   diminished physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in
   patients with CKD may lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further
   research must be conducted to understand the mechanisms of frailty in
   CKD and to confirm its association with clinical outcomes.}},

Title = {{Frailty and falls among adult patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis:
   a prospective cohort study}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of falls,
   with subsequent complications including fractures, loss of independence,
   hospitalization, and institutionalization. Factors associated with falls
   are poorly understood in this population. We hypothesized that insights
   derived from studies of the elderly might apply to adults of all ages
   undergoing hemodialysis; we focused on frailty, a phenotype of
   physiological decline strongly associated with falls in the elderly.
   Methods: In this prospective, longitudinal study of 95 patients
   undergoing hemodialysis (1/2009-3/2010), the association of frailty with
   future falls was explored using adjusted Poisson regression. Frailty was
   classified using the criteria established by Fried et al., as a
   combination of five components: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low
   activity, and slowed walking speed.
   Results: Over a median 6.7-month period of longitudinal follow-up,
   28.3\% of study participants (25.9\% of those under 65, 29.3\% of those
   65 and older) experienced a fall. After adjusting for age, sex, race,
   comorbidity, disability, number of medications, marital status, and
   education, frailty independently predicted a 3.09-fold (95\% CI:
   1.38-6.90, P=0.006) higher number of falls. This relationship between
   frailty and falls did not differ for younger and older adults (P=0.57).
   Conclusions: Frailty, a validated construct in the elderly, was a strong
   and independent predictor of falls in adults undergoing hemodialysis,
   regardless of age. Our results may aid in identifying frail hemodialysis
   patients who could be targeted for multidimensional fall prevention
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Bisphosphonates are widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis and
   are generally well tolerated. However, the United States Food and Drug
   Administration safety reports have highlighted the issue of renal safety
   in bisphosphonate-treated patients. All bisphosphonates carry labeled
   warnings or a contraindication for use in patients with severe renal
   impairment (creatinine clearance <30 or <35mL/min). Data from pivotal
   trials and their extension studies of bisphosphonates approved for the
   management of osteoporosis were obtained via PubMed, and were reviewed
   with support from published articles available on PubMed. Renal safety
   analyses of pivotal trials of oral alendronate, risedronate, and
   ibandronate for postmenopausal osteoporosis showed no short-term or
   long-term effects on renal function. Transient postinfusion increases in
   serum creatinine have been reported in patients receiving intravenous
   ibandronate and zoledronic acid; however, studies showed that treatment
   with these agents did not result in long-term renal function
   deterioration in clinical trial patients with osteoporosis. All
   bisphosphonate therapies have warnings for use in patients with severe
   renal impairment. Clinical trial results have shown that even in
   elderly, frail, osteoporotic patients with renal impairment, intravenous
   bisphosphonate therapy administration in accordance with the prescribing
   information did not result in long-term renal function decline.
   Physicians should follow guidelines for bisphosphonate therapies
   administration at all times. (c) 2013 American Society for Bone and

Abstract = {{AimsThe Cockcroft-Gault (CG), the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease

   estimating GFR in older adults.
   MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted at the geriatric wards of
   two hospitals in The Netherlands. Patients aged 70 years or above with
   an estimated (e)GFR below 60mlmin(-1)1.73m(-2) were included. The CG, CG
   calculated with ideal bodyweight (IBW), MDRD and CKD-EPI formulae were
   compared with a criterion standard, sinistrin clearance. Renal function
   was classified into five stages according to the National Kidney
   Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative chronic kidney disease
   classification, as follows (in mlmin(-1)1.73m(-2)): stage1, eGFR90;
   stage2, eGFR of 60-89; stage3, eGFR of 30-59; stage4, eGFR of 15-29; and
   stage 5, eGFR<15.
   ResultsSixteen patients, 50\% male, with a mean age of 82 years (range
   71-87years) and mean body mass index 26kgm(-2) (range 18-36kgm(-2)),
   were included. On average, all formulae slightly overestimated GFR, as
   follows (in mlmin(-1)1.73m(-2)): CG +0.05 {[}95\% confidence interval
   (CI) -28 to +28]; CG with IBW +0.03 (95\% CI -20 to +20); MDRD +9 (95\%
   CI -16 to +34); and CKD-EPI +5 (95\% CI -20 to +29). They classified
   kidney disease correctly in 68.8\% (CG), 75\% (CG with IBW), 43.8\%
   (MDRD) and 68.8\% (CKD-EPI) of the participants, respectively.
   ConclusionsThe CG, CG with IBW, MDRD and CKD-EPI formulae estimate the

Abstract = {{Most patients starting dialysis can choose between peritoneal dialysis
   and haemodialysis. There is little evidence proving that one form of
   dialysis is better than the other; although there may be an early
   advantage to peritoneal dialysis (PD) in young patients with residual

   years on PD so dialysis modality will often change during a long
   dialysis career. Quality of life studies, which must be interpreted
   carefully, indicate that patients require information about the impact
   of dialysis on their lifestyle as well as health-related outcomes so
   that they can choose the most suitable dialysis modality. Increasing
   numbers of frail elderly patients are starting dialysis; support in the
   home by nursing staff may facilitate the use of PD in this group. In the
   UK guidelines prioritise the patient's choice of dialysis modality
   (where feasible) based on good quality predialysis education. Cost of

Abstract = {{The prevalence of chronic pain increases with age, although solid and
   comparable epidemiological data addressing the oldest old and specific
   settings are still sparse. Chronic pain is associated with
   multimorbidity, disability and reduced quality of life. However, in many
   cases it goes undetected, it is not adequately screened and assessed,
   and treatment is suboptimal. Most drugs used for pain treatment carry a
   higher risk of side effects in older subjects. This paper explores the
   epidemiology, screening, diagnosis and management of chronic pain in old
   age in three European countries. Chronic pain may go undiagnosed, as
   screening programs for identification of this problem are yet uncommon,
   both in community care and in hospitals and nursing homes. Pain
   assessment is increasingly (but not universally) a part of comprehensive
   geriatric assessment, and most geriatricians receive training and seem
   to be confident in the diagnosis and management of chronic pain in
   complex or frail patients. Primary care physicians are usually the first
   providers to manage chronic pain, and only some patients are referred
   for specialist care. Pain clinics are widely available in the three
   countries, but older patients do not usually reach them. Acetaminophen
   is the mainstay of treatment of chronic pain, with reducing - but yet
   significant - use of NSAIDs and increasing use of weak opioids, mostly
   tramadol. Strong opioids are not widely used in older subjects, and
   concerns about side effects and on the choice of drugs in chronic renal
   disease are still present. Non-pharmacological therapies are not
   standardised. Attitudes towards chronic pain may hinder identification
   and management of this highly prevalent geriatric problem. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Background: Heart failure (HF) disease management can improve health
   outcomes for older community dwelling patients with heart failure. HF
   disease management has not been studied in skilled nursing facilities, a
   major site of transitional care for older adults.
   Methods and anticipated results: The objective of this trial is to
   investigate if a HF-disease management program (HF-DMP) in skilled
   nursing facilities (SNF)s will decrease all-cause rehospitalizations for
   the first 60 days post-SNF admission. The trial is a randomized cluster
   trial to be conducted in 12 for-profit SNF in the greater Cleveland
   area. The study population is inclusive of patients with HF regardless
   of ejection fraction but excludes those patients on dialysis and with a
   life expectancy of 6 months or less. The HF-DMP includes 7 elements
   considered standard of care for patients with HF documentation of left
   ventricular function, tracking of weight and symptoms, medication
   titration, discharge instructions, 7-day follow-up appointment post-SNF
   discharge, and patient education. The HF-DMP is conducted by a research
   nurse tasked with adhering to each element of the program and regularly
   audited to maintain fidelity of the program. Additional outcomes include
   health status, self-care management, and discharge destination.
   Conclusions: The SNF-Connect Trial is the first trial of its kind to
   assess if a HF-DMP will improve outcomes for patients in SNFs. This
   trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness of HF-DMP to improve

   Performance-based frailty (PbF) used gait speed over 20 feet and 5
   sit-to-stand (1 point each for lowest quintile) for the physical
   components of the frailty phenotype plus exhaustion (Short Form-36 {[}
   SF-36] vitality score, 55) and physical activity (lowest quintile of
   weekly kcal energy expenditure on leisure activity on the Physical
   Activity Scale for the Elderly questionnaire; 1 point). Function-based
   frailty (FbF) defined by questionnaire measures of physical functioning
   (SF-36 Physical Function score, 75; 1 point), exhaustion, and physical
   activity as for PbF. A score of 2 or greater was defined as frail.
   Outcomes related to muscle size included muscle area of the contractile
   tissue of the anterior tibialis and quadriceps muscles using magnetic
   resonance imaging, phase angle using bioimpedance analysis, lean body
   mass using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and body mass index (BMI).
   Linear regression was used to analyze associations between frailty and
   muscle size, with and without sex and age covariates.
   Results: Fifty-nine percent of individuals met PbF criteria, 63\% met
   FbF criteria, and 55\% met both. In univariate analysis, PbF and FbF
   were associated with smaller muscle area of the quadriceps, smaller
   phase angle, and higher BMI. Associations remained significant for the
   quadriceps after adjustment for age and sex. The magnitude of
   association of PbF with quadriceps muscle area was greater than 10 years
   of age (-30.3 cm(2) P = 5.02 vs. -6.6 cm(2) P < .0001) in multivariate
   analysis. There was no significant association between either measure of
   frailty and other measures of body composition after adjustment for age
   and sex.
   Conclusion: Frailty was associated with measurements related to muscle
   size in a population of individuals with chronic kidney disease, a known
   contributor to muscle wasting. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of

Abstract = {{Objectives
   To determine whether higher cystatin C would be associated with greater
   frailty in men aged 65 and older.
   Design
   Cross-sectional cohort study.
   Setting
   Six U.S. sites.
   Participants
   A random sample of community-dwelling men aged 65 and older enrolled in
   the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study (mean age 73.8; 9.8\%
   frail and 47.2\% intermediate frailty; N = 1,602).
   Measurements
   Serum cystatin C, creatinine, and frailty were measured. Frailty was
   analyzed as an ordinal outcome of robust, intermediate frailty, and
   frail using a multinomial logistic regression model, and the base model
   was adjusted for age, race, and clinical site.
   Results
   Higher cystatin C was associated with seven times greater odds of being
   frail than being robust (odds ratio (OR) quartile 4 vs 1 = 7.12, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) = 3.76-13.46) and 2.4 times greater odds of
   intermediate frailty than robust (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 2.38, 95\% CI =
   1.70-3.32). The association was attenuated but persisted after adjusting
   for multiple possible confounders. In contrast, neither higher serum
   creatinine (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.36, 95\% CI = 0.78-2.40) nor lower
   creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR quartile 4 vs
   1 = 1.01, 95\% CI = 0.54-1.87) was associated in a graded manner with
   greater odds of frailty.
   Conclusion
   Higher cystatin C, but not creatinine-based measures, was associated
   with greater odds of frailty in this cohort of older men.}},

Abstract = {{Anemia is an important healthcare concern among the elderly. In these
   patients, the anemia is often mild, with a hemoglobin level >10g/dL. It

   is usually of multifactorial origin, including chronic inflammation,
   chronic kidney disease, nutrient deficiencies and iron deficiency
   (approximately two-thirds of all cases). The remaining cases are
   unexplained (unknown etiology). In the elderly, the classic diagnosis of
   anemia, which is based on the mean corpuscular volume associated with a
   low hemoglobin level, might not be accurate. A predefined standardized
   diagnostic procedure should be followed. In the common case of frail
   elderly patients, all investigations should be carefully considered and

Abstract = {{Objectives To quantify the prevalence of frailty in adults of all ages
   undergoing chronic hemodialysis, its relationship to comorbidity and

   hemodialysis center in Baltimore, Maryland. Participants One hundred
   forty-six individuals undergoing hemodialysis enrolled between January
   2009 and March 2010 and followed through August 2012. Measurements
   Frailty, comorbidity, and disability on enrollment in the study and
   subsequent mortality and hospitalizations. Results At enrollment, 50.0\%
   of older (65) and 35.4\% of younger (<65) individuals undergoing
   hemodialysis were frail; 35.9\% and 29.3\%, respectively, were
   intermediately frail. Three-year mortality was 16.2\% for nonfrail,
   34.4\% for intermediately frail, and 40.2\% for frail participants.
   Intermediate frailty and frailty were associated with a 2.7 times (95\%
   confidence interval (CI)=1.02-7.07, P=.046) and 2.6 times (95\%
   CI=1.04-6.49, P=.04) greater risk of death independent of age, sex,
   comorbidity, and disability. In the year after enrollment, median number
   of hospitalizations was 1 (interquartile range 0-3). The proportion with
   two or more hospitalizations was 28.2\% for nonfrail, 25.5\% for
   intermediately frail, and 42.6\% for frail participants. Although
   intermediate frailty was not associated with number of hospitalizations
   (relative risk=0.76, 95\% CI=0.49-1.16, P=.21), frailty was associated
   with 1.4 times (95\% CI=1.00-2.03, P=.049) more hospitalizations
   independent of age, sex, comorbidity, and disability. The association
   between frailty and mortality (interaction P=.64) and hospitalizations
   (P=.14) did not differ between older and younger participants.
   Conclusions Adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis have a high
   prevalence of frailty, more than five times as high as
   community-dwelling older adults. In this population, regardless of age,
   frailty is a strong, independent predictor of mortality and number of

Abstract = {{Background: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with
   elevated risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is
   also strongly associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical
   performance and frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well
   established. Methods: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery
   (SPPB; a summary test of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range
   0-12) and the five elements of frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal
   Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting for demographics and
   multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for the outcome
   of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty
   status. Results: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71)
   years, median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for
   non-dialysis patients was 49 (36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB
   score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of participants were frail and 43\%
   were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73
   m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61 points lower
   for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all

   (OR 2.02; p = 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated
   with worse frailty status compared with eGFR >60 ml/mm/1.73 m(2).
   Conclusions: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance

Abstract = {{Patients treated with dialysis have low levels of physical functioning
   and activity. Whether this translates into frailty or not may depend on
   how the frailty phenotype is operationalized. This is a secondary
   analysis of data from the Renal Exercise Demonstration Project to
   evaluate two methods of operationalizing the Fried phenotype for
   frailty: Using measured walking speed and muscle weakness (FRAILmeas)
   and using substitution of the Physical Function Scale (PF) from the
   SF-36 questionnaire for walking speed and muscle weakness (FRAILsubst).
   Complete data for both measures were available for 188 hemodialysis
   patients. The frailty score (FRAILmeas) was the sum of criteria scores
   for measured gait speed, chair stand, body mass index, vitality, and
   physical activity. The frailty score (FRAILsubst) substituted the PF
   scale score (<75) as a surrogate measure for gait speed and for
   weakness. The frailty score ranged from 0 to 5. Scores =3 were
   categorized as frail, and <3 as not frail. The substitution of the PF
   score for walking speed and muscle weakness resulted in 78\% of patients
   being categorized as frail compared to 24\% using actual measured
   walking speed and muscle weakness (P?<?.001). The component of frailty
   that had the highest prevalence was low physical activity (average 54\%

Abstract = {{The metaphor of a frail older person as a car running out of petrol
   seems to have resonance in the lay media. Though it may be an over
   simplistic representation of a complex and dynamic process, it does
   facilitate discussion with patients and their relatives about the
   appropriateness of interventions, such as whether or not there is enough
   fuel (physiological reserves) to get up a really steep hill (undergo a
   coronary bypass graft). It can also be used as a way to emphasise what
   can be done to help. For example, in some longitudinal studies, 5\% of
   older patients are less frail after 5 years follow up, suggesting there
   are things that can still be done to ``fill up the tank{''}. This review
   will consider whether drug therapies can fulfil this role.
   Frail older people are often prescribed long lists of medications but it
   is debatable whether current treatments actually address the causes or
   consequences of frailty itself. Here, we explore the associations
   between frailty and co-morbidity and evaluate whether the management of
   chronic disease may impact frailty development or progression. We
   consider how the management of hypertension may have an important role
   in the prevention of frailty, mediated by reduction of cerebrovascular
   disease, but why aggressive management of hypertension may have negative
   consequences for those who are already frail. We also summarise the
   evidence linking immunosenescence, inflammation and endocrine changes to
   frailty and investigate whether targeted drug therapy has the potential
   to influence frailty pathophysiology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of
   reduced functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited
   data describing the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged
   patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   Study Design: Observational study.
   Setting \& Participants: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages
   1-4 CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 90
   mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the CKD-EPI {[}CKD Epidemiology Collaboration]
   serum creatinine-based equation) or evidence of microalbuminuria
   enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based cohort study.
   Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the
   Cardiovascular Health Study.
   Outcome: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its
   association with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal
   replacement therapy.
   Measurements: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3
   or more of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness,
   unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity. We
   estimated kidney function using serum cystatin C concentrations
   (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to relationships of serum
   creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.
   Results: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean
   eGFR(cys) was 51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0\%)
   was twice that of the much older non-CKD reference population (P <
   0.01). The most common frailty components were physical inactivity and
   exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes, eGFR(cys) categories of
   < 30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a 2.8-(95\% CI,
   1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95\% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of frailty
   compared with GFR(cys) >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events
   during a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty
   phenotype was associated with an estimated 2.5 (95\% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold
   greater risk of death or dialysis therapy.
   Limitations: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding
   temporal relationships between CKD and frailty.
   Conclusions: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with
   CKD and is associated with lower eGFRcys and increased risk of death or

Abstract = {{The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality
   Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney
   Disease: Evaluation, Classification, and Stratification expanded the
   focus of chronic kidney disease (CKD) management from end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of kidney disease including early
   kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease to kidney failure. A
   consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of older adults
   are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress to
   ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular
   filtration rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent
   ``disease{''} and using age-specific cut-points for staging CKD has been
   proposed. This implies that among older adults, CKD, as currently
   defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have shown that among
   people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated with an
   increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia,
   acidosis) and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular
   disease (CVD). Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with
   problems not traditionally thought to be associated with kidney disease.
   These nondisease-specific outcomes include functional decline, cognitive
   impairment, and frailty. Future research studies are necessary to
   determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD and
   nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the
   longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences
   among the oldest old with CKD.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The age of patients with end-stage renal disease is
   increasing in Europe and United States. In France, patients older than
   75 years represent 40\% of the patients who start renal replacement
   therapy (dialysis or renal transplantation). In these elderly patients
   with many comorbidities, the benefit of dialysis remains controversial.
   To provide clear information to patients about diagnosis, prognosis, and
   all treatment options, more data are needed on their clinical
   characteristics, therapeutic projects, and outcome.
   Methods. Researchers present here the ongoing Parcours de Soins des
   PersonnesAges (PSPA) multicenter prospective study, which includes 581
   patients with a mean age of 825 years and an estimated glomerular
   filtration rate (by sMDRD) of 144ml/min/1.73m(2) without dialysis.
   Results. Despite a high prevalence of associated comorbidities, most of
   the patients are autonomous, living at home. Less than 10\% are followed
   jointly by a nephrologist and a geriatrician. At inclusion, postponed
   dialysis decision due to stable estimated glomerular filtration rate was
   reported in 43\%, 17\% of the patients are under evaluation, the
   decision to start dialysis was chosen in 24\% of the patients,
   nondialysis decision was decided in 16\%.
   Conclusions. Geriatricians' expertise may help nephrologists to identify
   patients at high risk of early death for who nondialysis care may be
   discussed. They also may be more able to evaluate and anticipate the
   impact of such restricting treatments. A multidisciplinary approach of
   these old and frail patients' needs to be reinforced.}},

   Methods and Results: The influence of different comorbid conditions on

   (NYHA) functional class, hospitalizations for heart failure, and
   all-cause mortality after CRT implantation was analyzed in 172
   consecutive patients (mean age 71 +/- 9 y), implanted from October 2008

   of 18 +/- 9 months, 21 patients died and 57 were admitted for heart
   failure. Left ventricular remodeling and improvement in NYHA functional
   class were independent from comorbidity burden. However, diabetes

Abstract = {{Background-Recent findings suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) may
   be associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).
   Given the high prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD in the general
   population, in depth analysis of this association is warranted.
   Methods and Results-We pooled individual participant data from 5
   community-based cohorts from Europe (second Nord-Trondelag Health Study
   {[}HUNT2], Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease
   {[}PREVEND], and the Tromso study) and the United States
   (Atherosclerosis Risks in Communities {[}ARIC] and Cardiovascular Health
   Study {[}CHS]) to assess the association of estimated glomerular
   filtration rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and CKD with objectively verified
   VTE. To estimate adjusted hazard ratios for VTE, categorical and
   continuous spline models were fit by using Cox regression with
   shared-frailty or random-effect meta-analysis. A total of 1178 VTE
   events occurred over 599 453 person-years follow-up. Relative to eGFR
   100 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), hazard ratios for VTE were 1.29 (95\%
   confidence interval, 1.04-1.59) for eGFR 75, 1.31 (1.00-1.71) for eGFR
   60, 1.82 (1.27-2.60) for eGFR 45, and 1.95 (1.26-3.01) for eGFR 30
   mL/min per 1.73 m(2). In comparison with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio
   (ACR) of 5.0 mg/g, the hazard ratios for VTE were 1.34 (1.04-1.72) for
   ACR 30 mg/g, 1.60 (1.08-2.36) for ACR 300 mg/g, and 1.92 (1.19-3.09) for
   ACR 1000 mg/g. There was no interaction between clinical categories of
   eGFR and ACR (P=0.20). The adjusted hazard ratio for CKD, defined as
   eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or albuminuria >= 30 mg/g, (versus no CKD)
   was 1.54 (95\% confidence interval, 1.15-2.06). Associations were
   consistent in subgroups according to age, sex, and comorbidities, and
   for unprovoked versus provoked VTE, as well.
   Conclusions-Both eGFR and ACR are independently associated with
   increased risk of VTE in the general population, even across the normal
   eGFR and ACR ranges. (Circulation. 2012;126:1964-1971.)}},

Abstract = {{During the last century the considerable increase in life expectancy has
   led to important demographic changes and, consequently, to new clinical

   a multidimensional geriatric assessment.
   A large number of approaches have been validated in different clinical

   instruments demonstrated to have a crucial role in the identification of
   frail individuals and in their clinical management. Interestingly, some

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Peritonitis is the most common infectious
   complication seen in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Traditionally, exit site
   infection (ESI) has been thought to predispose PD patients to
   peritonitis, although the risks have not been quantified. This study
   aimed to quantify the risk of PD peritonitis after ESI.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements Data from 203 clinically
   stable PD patients >18 years of age who were followed as part of a
   randomized controlled trial over 18 months were used to estimate the
   risk of developing peritonitis within 30 days of an ESI compared with
   individuals who did not have a recent ESI. Sensitivity analyses were
   performed at 15, 45, and 60 days.
   Results Patients were mostly male (64.5\%) and Caucasian, with a mean
   age of 60.5 +/- 14.4 years. There were 44 ESIs and 87 peritonitis
   episodes during the 18-month study. Seven patients had an ESI followed
   by peritonitis within 30 days. Using a frailty model, patients who had
   an ESI had a significantly higher risk of developing peritonitis within
   30 days, even if the ESI was appropriately treated. This risk was
   maximal early on and diminished with time, with hazard ratios (95\%
   confidence interval) of 11.1 at 15 days (HR=11.1, 95\% CI=4.9-25.1), 5.3
   at 45 days (2.5-11.3), and 4.9 at 60 days (2.4-9.9). In 2.3\% of
   patients, subsequent peritonitis was caused by the same organism as the
   previous ESI.

Abstract = {{Background. Incidence rates of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD) vary geographically not only between but
   within countries. This study uses data from the French REIN registry to
   quantify the extent to which socio-economic environment, health care
   supply and medical practice patterns such as early dialysis initiation
   or greater propensity to accept frail or elderly patients for dialysis,
   may explain spatial patterns of ESRD incidence in 85 French districts.
   Methods. The association between age-and sex-adjusted incidence rates of
   RRT in 2008-09 and 17 indicators was explored at the district level with
   geographically appropriate methods, before and after controlling for the
   effects of diabetes and the other significant indicators. Rate ratios
   (RR) and credible intervals (CI) were estimated for a 1-SD increase of
   each covariate.
   Results. Crude RRT incidence by district ranged from 85.8 to 225.5 per
   million inhabitants. The age-and sex-adjusted RRT incidence increased
   with the proportion of people unemployed (RR: 1.05, 95\% CI 1.01-1.09),
   the population density (RR: 1.07, 95\% CI 1.02-1.12) and the prevalence
   of diabetes (RR: 1.08, 95\% CI 1.03-1.12). It also increased with the
   proportions of incident ESRD patients >85 years (RR: 1.02, 95\% CI
   0.99-1.06), of deaths within the first 3 months of RRT (RR: 1.03, 95\%
   CI 1.0-1.06) and of nephrologists in private practice (RR: 1.05, 95\% CI
   1.01-1.08) and with the median estimated glomerular filtration rate
   (eGFR) at dialysis initiation (RR: 1.06, 95\% CI 1.02-1.09).
   Conclusion. This study confirms that socio-economic factors and diabetes

   highlights the variability of practice patterns, especially decisions

   Objectives: To determine the effects of treatment with renin-angiotensin

   survival rates and functional decline in PP with evidence-based clinical
   indications for treatment with any of these drug families.
   Method: Prospective observational multicentre cohort study with a
   12-month follow-up period. We selected PP with any condition of the
   following: chronic heart failure, coronary heart disease, chronic renal
   disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes
   mellitus with any visceral involvement, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia.
   Clinical, functional (Barthel index), socio-familial risk data and drug
   prescriptions were measured at baseline. Multivariate Cox proportional
   hazards and logistic regression models were used to identify variables
   independently associated with survival and functional decline.
   Results: The analysis included 1260 PP. The mean age was 79 +/- 9.5
   years. The mortality rate was 34.5\%. Statin (aHR 0.671; P = 0.001),
   beta-blocker plus statin (aHR 0.645; P = 0.007), ACEI/ARB plus statin
   (aHR 0.680; P = 0.002), or combined ACEI/ARB plus statin plus
   beta-blocker (aHR 0.541; P = 0.000) prescriptions were associated with

   plus beta-blockers (aOR 0.563; P = 0.031).
   Conclusions: The prescription of statins, alone or in combination with

Abstract = {{Frailty is associated with a pro-inflammatory state, which has been
   characterized by elevated levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers,
   but has not been related to the number of co-existing chronic diseases
   associated with inflammation. We sought to determine the extent to which
   a higher number of inflammatory-related diseases is associated with
   frailty and to identify the most common disease patterns associated with
   being frail in older adults. We performed binomial regression analyses
   to assess whether a higher count of inflammatory-related diseases
   increases the probability of frailty using data from the WHAS I and II,
   companion cohorts composed of 70-79-year-old community-dwelling older
   women in Baltimore, Maryland (n = 620). An increase of one
   inflammatory-related disease was associated log-linearly with frailty
   (Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 2.28, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) =
   1.81-2.87). After adjusting for age, race, education, and smoking
   status, the probability of frailty remained significant (PR = 1.97,

   (CKD) and depressive symptoms (Prevalence = 22.9\%, 95\%CI =

   combinations. Their prevalence percentages were significantly higher in
   the frail versus non-frail women. A higher inflammatory-related disease

   the likelihood of frailty. Shared mechanisms among specific disease

Abstract = {{Structured follow-up after revascularisation for chronic critical limb
   ischaemia (CLI) aims at sustained treatment success and continued best
   patient care. Thereby, efforts need to address three fundamental
   domains: (A) best medical therapy, both to protect the arterial
   reconstruction locally and to reduce atherosclerotic burden
   systemically; (B) surveillance of the arterial reconstruction; and (C)
   timely initiation of repeat interventions. As most CLI patients are
   elderly and frail, sustained resolution of CLI and preserved ambulatory
   capacity may decide over independent living and overall prognosis.
   Despite this importance, previous guidelines have largely ignored
   follow-up after CLI; arguably because of a striking lack of evidence and
   because of a widespread assumption that, in the context of CLI, efficacy
   of initial revascularisation will determine prognosis during the short
   remaining life expectancy. This chapter of the current CLI guidelines
   aims to challenge this disposition and to recommend evidentially best
   clinical practice by critically appraising available evidence in all of
   the above domains, including antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy,
   clinical surveillance, use of duplex ultrasound, and indications for and
   preferred type of repeat interventions for failing and failed
   reconstructions. However, as corresponding studies are rarely performed
   among CLI patients specifically, evidence has to be consulted that
   derives from expanded patient populations. Therefore, most
   recommendations are based on extrapolations or subgroup analyses, which
   leads to an almost systematic degradation of their strength.
   Endovascular reconstruction and surgical bypass are considered
   separately, as are specific contexts such as diabetes or renal failure;
   and critical issues are highlighted throughout to inform future studies.

Abstract = {{Background-For the large and growing population of elderly patients with
   cardiovascular disease, it is important to identify clinically relevant
   measures of biological age and their contribution to risk. Frailty is an
   emerging concept in medicine denoting increased vulnerability and
   decreased physiological reserves. We analyzed the manner in which the
   variable frailty predicts short-term outcomes for elderly non-ST-segment
   elevation myocardial infarction patients.
   Methods and Results-Patients aged >= 75 years, with diagnosed
   non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were included at 3
   centers, and clinical data including judgment of frailty were collected
   prospectively. Frailty was defined according to the Canadian Study of
   Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale. The impact of the comorbid
   conditions on risk was quantified by the coronary artery
   disease-specific index. Of 307 patients, 149 (48.5\%) were considered
   frail. By multiple logistic regression, frailty was found to be strongly
   and independently associated with risk for the primary composite outcome
   (death from any cause, myocardial reinfarction, revascularization due to
   ischemia, hospitalization for any cause, major bleeding,
   stroke/transient ischemic attack, and need for dialysis up to 1 month
   after inclusion) (odds ratio, 2.2; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3-3.7),
   in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 4.6; 95\% confidence interval,
   1.3-16.8), and 1-month mortality (odds ratio, 4.7; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.7-13.0).
   Conclusions-Frailty is strongly and independently associated with
   in-hospital mortality, 1-month mortality, prolonged hospital care, and
   the primary composite outcome. The combined use of frailty and
   comorbidity may constitute an ultimate risk prediction concept in regard
   to cardiovascular patients with complex needs. Clinical Trial

Title = {{Duration of temporary catheter use for hemodialysis: an observational,
   prospective evaluation of renal units in Brazil}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: For chronic hemodialysis, the ideal permanent vascular
   access is the arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Temporary catheters should be
   reserved for acute dialysis needs. The AVF is associated with lower
   infection rates, better clinical results, and a higher quality of life
   and survival when compared to temporary catheters. In Brazil, the
   proportion of patients with temporary catheters for more than 3 months
   from the beginning of therapy is used as an evaluation of the quality of
   renal units. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated
   with the time between the beginning of hemodialysis with temporary
   catheters and the placement of the first arteriovenous fistula in
   Brazil.
   Methods: This is an observational, prospective non-concurrent study
   using national administrative registries of all patients financed by the
   public health system who began renal replacement therapy (RRT) between
   2000 and 2004 in Brazil. Incident patients were eligible who had
   hemodialysis for the first time. Patients were excluded who: had
   hemodialysis reportedly started after the date of death (inconsistent
   database); were younger than 18 years old; had HIV; had no record of the
   first dialysis unit; and were dialyzed in units with less than twenty
   patients. To evaluate individual and renal unit factors associated with
   the event of interest, the frailty model was used (N = 55,589).
   Results: Among the 23,824 patients (42.9\%) who underwent fistula
   placement in the period of the study, 18.2\% maintained the temporary
   catheter for more than three months until the fistula creation. The
   analysis identified five statistically significant factors associated
   with longer time until first fistula: higher age (Hazard-risk - HR 0.99,
   95\% CI 0.99-1.00); having hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (HR
   0.94, 95\% CI 0.9-0.98) as the cause of chronic renal disease; residing
   in capitals cities (HR 0.92, 95\% CI 0.9-0.95) and certain regions in
   Brazil - South (HR 0.83, 95\% CI 0.8-0.87), Midwest (HR 0.88, 95\% CI
   0.83-0.94), Northeast (HR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.88-0.94), or North (HR 0.88,
   95\% CI 0.83-0.94) and the type of renal unit (public or private).
   Conclusion: Monitoring the provision of arteriovenous fistulas in renal
   units could improve the care given to patients with end stage renal
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased
   risk of developing aging-related problems, such as frailty, impaired
   physical function, falls, poor nutrition and cognitive impairment. These
   factors affect dialysis outcomes, which can be very poor in frail,
   elderly patients who often experience a decline in overall health and
   physical function and have short survival. The default treatment option
   for these patients is hospital-based hemodialysis, often with little
   consideration of how this modality will affect the survival or quality
   of life of individual patients. A comparison of quality of life of
   elderly patients on hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis shows that
   those on peritoneal dialysis have less illness intrusion. Assisted
   peritoneal dialysis enables a greater number of frail, elderly patients
   to have dialysis in their own homes. Dialysis may not extend survival
   for those with multiple comorbidities, so conservative care (nondialysis
   treatment) should be considered. To improve the outcomes of elderly
   patients with ESRD, it is necessary to develop a realistic approach to
   overall prognosis, quality of life and how the patient copes with the
   disabilities associated with aging. This approach includes having

Abstract = {{Objective. Recruitment is one of the most serious challenges in
   randomized clinical trials (RCTs), especially in the old and frail
   population. A Norwegian multicentre RCT targeting end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) patients older than 70 years was initiated to compare the
   impact on quality of life of early or late start of dialysis. Owing to
   poor inclusion the RCT was closed. The aim of the present study was to
   explore possible reasons for the recruitment failure. Material and
   methods. A questionnaire was distributed to all Norwegian nephrologists.
   The questionnaire presented 11 statements which cited possible reasons
   for not including elderly ESRD patients in the RCT in question. Results.
   The highest rated reasons for non-inclusion were the physician's wish to
   decide the timing of dialysis individually and the patient's wish to
   postpone the start of treatment. High mean scores were also found for
   reasons related to workload and capacity at the dialysis unit, whereas
   the influence of the doctor-patient relationship and competing studies
   were judged not to be important. Conclusions. The results indicate that
   confidence in individually decided treatment and fear of losing
   professional autonomy make Norwegian nephrologists reluctant to include

   Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate
   prescribing of 21 primarily renally cleared medications based on 2
   separate estimates of renal function and to identify factors associated
   with this form of suboptimal prescribing in older VA nursing home (NH)
   patients.
   Design: Longitudinal study
   Participants: Participants were 1304 patients, aged 65 years or older,
   admitted between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2005, for 90 days or more
   to 1 of 133 VA NHs.
   Main Measures: Potentially inappropriate prescribing of primarily
   renally cleared medications determined by estimating creatinine
   clearance using the Cockcroft Gault (CG) and Modification of Diet in
   Renal Disease (MDRD) equations and applying explicit guidelines for
   contraindicated medications and dosing.
   Key Results: The median estimated creatinine clearance via CG was 67
   mL/min, whereas it was 80 mL/min/1.73m(2) with the MDRD. Overall,
   11.89\% patients via CG and only 5.98\% via MDRD had evidence of
   potentially inappropriate prescribing of at least 1 renally cleared
   medication. The most commonly involved medications were ranitidine,
   glyburide, gabapentin, and nitrofurantoin. Factors associated with
   potentially inappropriate prescribing as per the CG were age older than
   85 (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] 4.24, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]

   comorbidity index, 95\% CI 1.01-1.19).
   Conclusions: Potentially inappropriate prescribing of renally cleared

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Elderly patients (>65 years old) are a rapidly
   growing demographic in the ESRD and intensive care unit (ICU)
   populations, yet the effect of ESRD status on critical illness in
   elderly patients remains unknown. Reliable estimates of prognosis would
   help to inform care and management of this frail and vulnerable
   population.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements The effect of ESRD status
   on survival and readmission rates was examined in a retrospective cohort
   of 14,650 elderly patients (>65 years old) admitted to 11 ICUs in
   Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada between 2000 and 2006. Logistic regression
   models were used to adjust odds of mortality and readmission to ICU for
   baseline case mix and illness severity.
   Results Elderly ESRD patients had twofold higher crude in-hospital
   mortality (22\% versus 13\%, P < 0.0001) and readmission rate (6.4
   versus 2.7\%, P = 0.001). After adjustment for illness severity alone or
   illness severity and case mix, the odds ratio for mortality decreased to
   0.85 (95\% Cl: 0.57 to 1.25) and 0.82 (95\% Cl: 0.55 to 1.23),
   respectively. In contrast, ESRD status remained significantly associated
   with readmission to ICU after adjustment for other risk factors (OR 2.06

   Conclusions Illness severity on admission, rather than ESRD status per
   se, appears to be the main driver of in-hospital mortality in elderly

   center dot Changes in body composition and renal function with old age

   AIMS
   Frailty, a syndrome of decreased physiological reserve that is prevalent
   in old age, impacts on clinical pharmacology. The aims of the study were
   to (1) determine whether frailty affects the pharmacokinetics of
   gentamicin and (2) assess the accuracy of different estimates of body
   size and renal clearance as estimates of gentamicin pharmacokinetics in
   older inpatients.
   METHODS
   This was an observational study of gentamicin pharmacokinetics in a
   cohort of Australian hospital inpatients aged >= 65 years, who were
   administered prophylactic intravenous gentamicin.
   RESULTS
   Of the 31 participants, 14 were frail and 17 non frail on the Reported
   Edmonton Frail Scale. The mean volume of distribution of gentamicin was
   14.8 +/- 1.4 l in frail participants and 15.3 +/- 2.2 l in non frail
   (NS). Volume of distribution correlated best with lean bodyweight.
   Gentamicin clearance was significantly lower in frail participants (46.6
   +/- 10.7 ml min-1) than in non frail (58.2 +/- 12.4 ml min-1, P = 0.01).
   The Cockcroft Gault estimate of creatinine clearance calculated using
   ideal bodyweight gave the best estimate of gentamicin clearance (mean
   error - 0.15 ml min-1, 95\% CI -2.67, 2.39). The Cockcroft Gault
   creatinine clearance calculated using actual bodyweight and the
   estimated glomerular filtration rate from the modified diet in renal
   disease equation overestimated gentamicin clearance, with mean errors of
   -10.15 ml min-1 (95\%CI -13.60, -6.71) and -18.86 ml min-1 (95\% CI
   -22.45, -15.27), respectively. The Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance
   calculated using lean bodyweight underestimated gentamicin clearance
   (mean error 6.54 ml min-1, 95\% CI 4.18, 8.90).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Frail older people have significantly lower gentamicin clearance than
   non frail. The best estimate of gentamicin clearance is obtained from
   the Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance calculated using ideal
   bodyweight.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is directly associated with
   survival. However, the prognostic significance of GFR might be different
   according to the formula used to estimate it. We aimed at comparing the
   association between GFR estimated using three different formulas and
   1-year survival in elderly patients discharged from acute care
   hospitals.
   Methods. Our series consisted of 439 patients aged 65 and older admitted
   to 11 acute care medical wards enrolled in a multicentre prospective
   observational study. GFR was estimated by body surface area-adjusted
   Cockcroft-Gault (CG-BSA), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
   study(MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
   (CKD-EPI) formulas. The relative risk of mortality in patients with
   estimated GFR = 30-59.9 or < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) compared to people with
   estimated GFR >= 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was calculated using Cox regression
   analysis.
   Results. Participants with reduced GFR showed an increased mortality,
   regardless of the equation used, and the highest one was associated with
   CG-BSA-estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). After adjusting for
   potential confounders, CKD-EPI-estimated GFR remained significantly
   associated with the outcome {[}30-59.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), hazard ratio
   (HR) = 1.70, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 1.02-2.98; < 30
   mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 2.60, 95\% CI = 1.20-5.66], while the strength of
   the association was clearly reduced for MDRD (30-59.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2),
   HR = 1.47, 95\% CI = 0.83-2.38; < 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m(2), HR = 2.07, 95\%
   CI = 1.01-4.30) and CG-BSA (30-59.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 1.79, 95\% CI
   = 0.67-4.53; < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 2.68, 95\% CI = 0.92-7.55).
   Conclusion. GFR adds to the list of prognostic indicators in elderly and
   frail people, and CKD-EPI-derived GFR, which outperforms to some extent
   MDRD and CG-BSA-derived GFR in a multivariable predictive model, seems
   worthy of testing in wider populations.}},

   of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Vitamin D deficiency and frailty in
   older Americans. J Intern Med 2010; 268: 171-180.
   Objective.
   To explore the relation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and
   frailty. Frailty is a multidimensional phenotype that describes
   declining physical function and a vulnerability to adverse outcomes in
   the setting of physical stress such as illness or hospitalization. Low
   serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are known to be associated
   with multiple chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and
   diabetes, in addition to all cause mortality.
   Design.
   Using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES
   III), we evaluated the association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
   concentration and frailty, defined according to a set of criteria
   derived from a definition previously described and validated.
   Subjects.
   Nationally representative survey of noninstitutionalized US residents
   collected between 1988 and 1994.
   Results.
   25-Hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, defined as a serum concentration < 15 ng
   mL-1, was associated with a 3.7-fold increase in the odds of frailty
   amongst whites and a fourfold increase in the odds of frailty amongst
   non-whites. This association persisted after sensitivity analyses
   adjusting for season of the year and latitude of residence, intended to
   reduce misclassification of persons as 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficient or
   insufficient.
   Conclusion.
   Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations are associated with frailty
   amongst older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The incidence of chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT)
   varies markedly between Danish nephrology centres. The aim of the
   present study was to establish if there is regional and social variation
   in the incidence of chronic RRT in Denmark when analysed according to
   patient residence. The importance of diabetic nephropathy and patients
   aged 70 years or older was also studied.
   Methods. Incident patients on chronic RRT in the period 1995-2006 were
   identified in the Danish National Registry on Regular Dialysis and
   Transplantation. Information on residence, income, educational status
   and ethnic origin was obtained from Statistics Denmark. Rates of
   incident RRT patients were standardized for regional differences of sex
   and age as well as income, educational status and ethnic origin. Poisson
   regression was used when comparing rates.
   Results. Age- and sex-standardized incident chronic RRT rates among
   individuals with low income or short educational level were higher (P <
   0.0001) compared to other groups. Also, standardized rates of patients
   in total and patients aged 70 years or older were higher in the
   catchment areas of the nephrology centres located in the two largest
   cities than for patients with residence in other areas of the country (P
   < 0.0001). Standardizing for regional differences of ethnic origin did
   not change the rates. The incident chronic RRT rate caused by diabetic
   nephropathy was higher for patients with residence in the catchment area
   of the nephrology centre in the largest city {[}49 per million people
   (p.m.p.) (95\% CI = 40-57 p.m.p.)] compared to the catchment area of the
   nephrology centre located in the second largest city {[}31 (95\% CI =
   26-37 p.m.p.)] and other areas {[}29 p.m.p. (95\% CI = 26-31 p.m.p.)] in
   2001-06. When standardizing for differences in income among the
   30-69-year-old persons, the rate of patients with residence in the
   catchment area of the nephrology centre located in the largest city
   decreased but was still higher than in other regions (P = 0.0003).
   Conclusions. There are marked socio-economic and regional differences in
   rates of incident RRT patients. The rates of incident RRT patients are
   highest in the catchment areas of the two largest nephrology centres and
   this may be partly explained by a higher frequency of end-stage diabetic
   nephropathy and a new treatment programme targeting frail, mainly
   elderly, patients.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To update the evidence-based recommendations for the
   prevention and treatment of hypertension in adults for 2010.
   OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES: For lifestyle and pharmacological interventions,
   randomized trials and systematic reviews of trials were preferentially
   reviewed. Changes in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were the
   primary outcomes of interest. However, for lifestyle interventions,
   blood pressure lowering was accepted as a primary outcome given the
   general lack of long-term morbidity and mortality data in this field.
   Progressive renal impairment was also accepted as a clinically relevant
   primary outcome among Patients with chronic kidney disease.
   EVIDENCE: A Cochrane Collaboration librarian conducted an independent
   MEDLINE search from 2008 to August 2009 to update the 2009
   recommendations. To identify additional studies, reference lists were
   reviewed and experts were contacted. All relevant articles were reviewed
   and appraised independently by both content and methodological experts
   using prespecified levels of evidence.
   RECOMMENDATIONS: For lifestyle modifications to prevent and treat
   hypertension, restrict dietary sodium to 1500 mg (65 mmol) per day in
   adults 50 years of age or younger, to 1300 mg (57 mmol) per day in
   adults 51 to 70 years of age, and to 1200 mg (52 in not) per day in
   adults older than 70 years of age; perform 30 min to 60 min of moderate
   aerobic exercise four to seven days per week; maintain a healthy body
   weight (body mass index 18.5 kg/m(2) to 24.9 kg/m(2)) and waist
   circumference (less than 102 cm for men and less than 88 cm for women);
   limit alcohol consumption to no more than 14 standard drinks per week
   for men or nine standard drinks per week for women; follow a diet that
   emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-far dairy products, dietary and
   soluble fibre, whole grains and protein from plant sources, and that is
   low in saturated kit and cholesterol; and consider stress management in
   selected individuals with hypertension.
   For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds
   and targets should be predicated on the patient's global atherosclerotic
   risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should
   be decreased to less than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to less than
   130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney
   disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these
   target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered in
   all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in
   elderly patients who are frail). For adults without compelling
   indications for other agents, considerations for initial therapy should
   include thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
   inhibitors (in patients who are not black), long-acting calcium channel
   blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or beta-blockers
   (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two first-line
   agents may also be considered as initial treatment of hypertension if
   systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above target or if diastolic blood
   pressure is 10 mmHg above target. The combination of ACE inhibitors and
   ARBs should not be used, unless compelling indications are present to
   suggest consideration of dual therapy.
   Agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic
   hypertension include thiazide diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine
   CCBs or ARBs. In patients with coronary artery disease, ACE inhibitors,
   ARBs or beta-blockers are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients
   with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is
   preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney
   disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are
   recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or
   ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine
   CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. In selected high-risk
   patients in whom combination therapy is being considered, an ACE
   inhibitor plus a long-acting dihydro pyridine CCB is preferable to an
   ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic. All hypertensive patients with
   dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents
   outlined in the Canadian lipid treatment guidelines. Selected patients
   with hypertension who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy, but
   who are otherwise at high risk for cardiovascular events, should
   nonetheless receive Amin therapy. Once blood pressure is controlled,
   low-dose acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered.
   VALIDATION: All recommendations were graded according to the strength of
   the evidence and voted on by the 63 members of the Canadian Hypertension
   Education Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force. All
   recommendations reported here achieved at least 80\% consensus. These
   guidelines will continue to be updated annually.}},

Abstract = {{Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of
   adults, affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid
   diseases are encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of
   thyroid diseases may overlap with what is considered to be ``normal
   aging,{''} the presence of a thyroid disorder may go undiagnosed in the
   elderly. This potential problem is further compounded in elderly
   patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
   underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously
   attributed to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney
   disease. Frailty is being recognized as a contributing factor to the
   poor outcomes (hospitalization and high mortality) in elderly patients
   with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to frailty in elderly with CKD
   such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low testosterone,
   sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
   abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question
   of whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes
   in elderly CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible
   causes of frailty. In this review, we will focus on the associations
   between thyroid hormone abnormalities and the predisposing factors of
   frailty in elderly patients with CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of
   thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors predisposing to frailty in CKD
   patients is established, identification and treatment of thyroid
   abnormalities in this population would assume increased importance.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the acute and late
   outcomes of a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) program
   including both the transfemoral (TF) and transapical (TA) approaches;
   and 2) to determine the results of TAVI in patients deemed inoperable
   because of either porcelain aorta or frailty.
   Background Very few data exist on the results of a comprehensive TAVI
   program including both TA and TF approaches for the treatment of severe
   aortic stenosis in patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk.
   Methods Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with the Edwards valve
   (Edwards Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, California) between January 2005
   and June 2009 in 6 Canadian centers were included.
   Results A total of 345 procedures (TF: 168, TA: 177) were performed in
   339 patients. The predicted surgical mortality (Society of Thoracic
   Surgeons risk score) was 9.8 +/- 6.4\%. The procedural success rate was
   93.3\%, and 30-day mortality was 10.4\% (TF: 9.5\%, TA: 11.3\%). After a
   median follow-up of 8 months (25th to 75th interquartile range: 3 to 14
   months) the mortality rate was 22.1\%. The predictors of cumulative late
   mortality were peri-procedural sepsis (hazard ratio {[}HR]: 3.49, 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 1.48 to 8.28) or need for hemodynamic
   support (HR: 2.58, 95\% CI: 1.11 to 6), pulmonary hypertension (PH) (HR:
   1.88, 95\% CI: 1.17 to 3), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR: 2.30, 95\%
   CI: 1.38 to 3.84), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (
   HR: 1.75, 95\% CI: 1.09 to 2.83). Patients with either porcelain aorta
   (18\%) or frailty (25\%) exhibited acute outcomes similar to the rest of
   the study population, and porcelain aorta patients tended to have a
   better survival rate at 1-year follow-up.
   Conclusions A TAVI program including both TF and TA approaches was
   associated with comparable mortality as predicted by surgical risk
   calculators for the treatment of patients at very high or prohibitive
   surgical risk, including porcelain aorta and frail patients. Baseline
   (PH, COPD, CKD) and peri-procedural (hemodynamic support, sepsis)

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised
   health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL
   and increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
   is well documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and
   HRQOL. This article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates
   and proposed intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
   Recent findings
   A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid conditions
   related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
   Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects
   HRQOL due to associated comorbidities, side effects from
   antihypertensive medications and awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has
   been associated with HRQOL, but concerns about the safety of
   erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more conservative
   anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also major
   contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
   Summary
   Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are
   treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well
   being of patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether
   treatment interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population.
   Furthermore, whether integration of HRQOL assessment into routine
   clinical practice will improve HRQOL outcomes remains to be determined.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
   diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with
   chronic kidney disease.
   METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons
   with chronic kidney disease. We created a definition of frailty based on
   established validated criteria, modified to accommodate available data.
   We used logistic regression to determine whether and to what degree
   stages of chronic kidney disease were associated with frailty. We also
   examined factors that might mediate the association between frailty and
   chronic kidney disease.
   RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8\%. However, among
   persons with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated
   glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 20.9\% were frail.
   The odds of frailty were significantly increased among all stages of
   chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for the residual effects
   of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds of frailty
   associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
   with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis,
   inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular
   disease. Frailty and chronic kidney disease were independently
   associated with mortality.
   CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of
   chronic kidney disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic
   kidney disease. Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney
   disease and frailty connection remain elusive. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The majority of countries have enacted edicts to regulate organ
   transplantation due to mounting recognition of its intricacies and
   increasing level of global disquiet. Frail national economy and status
   of health care infrastructure restricts access of the local population
   to both dialysis and transplantation in Pakistan. There is a surge in
   kidney transplantation activities, however. I have reported the enormity
   of organ crime in Pakistan. The number of commercial renal transplants
   range from 3000 to 4500. Foreign nationals share the marketplace. There
   are current attempts from the government to stop organ trade by strictly
   enforcing a recently sanctioned law on organ transplantation. Scarcity
   of comprehensive reliable data has hampered plausible assessments and
   indispensable modifications to facilitate designs for the future health
   care. Alternatives to organ transplantation will augment the choice of
   treatment modalities for a proliferating end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
   population. The whole array of existing therapeutic modalities for ESRD
   has to be utilized. Promoting a fresh culture of organ donation by
   strengthening of the family institution may be another objective.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To update the evidence-based recommendations for the
   prevention and management of hypertension in adults for 2009.
   OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES: For lifestyle and pharmacological interventions,
   evidence front randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews of
   trials was preferentially reviewed. Changes in cardiovascular morbidity
   and mortality were the primary outcomes of interest. However, for
   lifestyle interventions, blood pressure lowering was accepted as a
   primary outcome given the lack of long-term morbidity and mortality data
   in this field. Progression of kidney dysfunction was also accepted as a
   clinically relevant primary outcome among patients with chronic kidney
   disease.
   EVIDENCE: A Cochrane collaboration librarian conductcd an independent
   MEDLINE search front 2007 to August 2008 to Update the 2008
   recommendations. To identify additional published studies, reference
   lists were reviewed and experts were contacted. All relevant articles
   were reviewed and appraised independently by both content and
   methodological experts using prespecified levels of evidence.
   RECOMMENDATIONS: For lifestyle modifications to prevent and treat
   ypertension, restrict dietary sodium to less than 2300 mg (100 mmol)/day
   (and 1500 mg to 2300 mg {[}65 mmol to 100 mmol]/day in hypertensive
   patients); perform 30 min to 60 min of aerobic exercise four to seven
   days per week; maintain a healthy body weight (body mass index 18.5
   kg/m(2) to 24.9 kg/m(2)) and waist circumference (smaller than 102 cm
   for men and smaller thin) 88 cm for women); limit alcohol consumption to
   no more than 14 units per week in men or nine units per week in women;
   follow a diet that is reduced in saturated far and cholesterol, and that
   emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and
   soluble fibre, whole grains and protein from plant sources; and consider
   stress management ill selected individuals with hypertension. For the
   pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and
   targets should be predicated on by the patient's global atherosclerotic
   risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should
   be decreased to lower than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to lower
   than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney
   disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these
   target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered
   it) all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in
   elderly patients who are frail). For adults without compelling
   indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide
   diuretics. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic
   and/or systolic hypertension include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
   inhibitors (in patients who are not black), long-acting calcium channel
   blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) or
   beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of
   two first-line agents may also be considered as the initial treatment of
   hypertension if the systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above the target
   or if the diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above the target. The
   combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used. Other agents
   appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension
   include long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with
   angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and
   ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with
   cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is
   preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney
   disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are
   recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or
   ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine
   CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. All hypertensive patients
   with dyslipidemia Should be treated using the thresholds, targets and
   agents outlined in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society position
   statement (recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of
   dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease). Selected
   high-risk patients with hypertension who do not. achieve thresholds for
   statin therapy according to the position paper Should nonetheless
   receive statin therapy. Once blood pressure is controlled,
   acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered.
   VALIDATION: All recommendations were graded according to strength of the
   evidence and Voted on by the 57 members of the Canadian Hypertension
   Education Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force. All
   recommendations reported here achieved at least 95\% consensus. These
   guidelines will continue to be updated annually.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The clinical characteristics of frail older patients with

   multicentric study. Results: Mean age was 87.2 +/- 5.3 years. Dyspnea
   (79.8\%), crepitant rales (76.9\%) and peripheral edema (73.1\%) were
   particularly frequent. Signs of low cardiac output such as renal
   insufficiency (46.9\%), cutaneous low flow (40.4\%), and systolic
   hypotension (<= 100 mm Hg) (24.3\%) were observed less often. Signs of
   cognitive impairment including anxiety (55.4\%), sleep disorders
   (43.7\%) and delirium (35.5\%) were frequent. Asthenia and chronic pain
   were noted in 92.3 and 37.5\% of cases, respectively. Mortality rates
   were 32.7, 59.6 and 71.2\% during hospitalization, at 6 months and at 12
   months, respectively. According to the multivariate Cox model, six
   significant factors suggesting a poor prognosis were observed: chronic
   renal insufficiency, past neuropsychological pathology, long-term
   treatment with nitrates, presence of edema, low cutaneous flow, and
   pain. The ability to sit on a chair was the only significant factor
   associated with a good prognosis. Conclusion: Our study identified some
   clinical and prognostic factors which had been observed in very old
   patients with refractory heart failure. Pain management has to be a
   priority in these patients in order to improve their quality of life.

Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{E26-E32}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The risk of invasive pneumococcal disease is increased among
   children with some chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to
   quantify the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in a wide range of
   chronic diseases.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS. Cases of invasive pneumococcal disease among
   children (aged 0-17 years) were identified from 1977 through 2005 by
   using a national surveillance program in Denmark. Rate ratios were
   assessed in a case-control study by using 10 age- and gender-matched
   controls per case. Chronic diseases were defined a priori.
   RESULTS. Among 1655 children with invasive pneumococcal disease, 19\%
   had a history of chronic disease, according to our definition, versus
   5\% of controls. An increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease was
   observed for children followed > 30 days after initial hospital contact
   for a chronic disease, but it was also increased in children with >= 5
   hospital contacts for any other reason. Children with a history of
   cancer, chronic renal disease, splenectomy, and transplantation were
   particularly susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease. Adjusted for
   number of hospital contacts, the risk for children with other types of
   chronic disease was 1.4-fold more than for those with hospital contacts
   for any reason.
   CONCLUSIONS. Cancer, chronic renal diseases, splenectomy, and
   transplantation were strongly associated with an increased risk of
   invasive pneumococcal disease in children. For children with other
   chronic diseases, their excess risk seemed to be attributable mostly to
   frail children having repeated hospital contact rather than their
   underlying condition.}},

Abstract = {{Background. In frail elderly patients, the chronic use of renal
   replacement therapy sometimes affords no tangible benefits and may even
   negatively affect their quality of life (Qol), making prolonged
   conservative management a reasonable option.
   Methods. This observational, uncontrolled study was conducted on 11
   end-stage renal disease patients over 75 years of age, on prolonged
   conservative treatment with a follow-up of at least 6 months, to assess
   compliance with the Italian clinical guidelines concerning the treatment
   of renal failure, comorbidities, hospital stays, and several
   psychometric and Qol indicators in the patients and their caregivers.
   Results. We found a substantial compliance with the targets recommended
   in the guidelines, a moderate tendency for disease progression and
   satisfactory psychometric and Qol parameters, which proved much the same
   as those observed in a parallel (uncontrolled) group of patients on
   haemodialysis.
   Conclusions. Our study shows that a conservative strategy is feasible
   for frail uraemic patients, achieving acceptable clinical results and a
   Qol comparable with patients on haemodialysis. The study also provides
   indications on how to plan trials on this topic, to obtain the evidence
   needed to guide the difficult choice of whether to recommend dialysis or
   conservative treatment for such frail patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To analyse the cross-sectional association between measures
   of renal function and inflammation in an elderly population and to
   evaluate the confounding effect of impaired physical functioning on
   these relationships. Material and methods. Cystatin C and creatinine
   were measured in serum samples from 1110 elderly subjects in a
   community-based cross-sectional survey (Lieto Study) in southwestern
   Finland. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by means of the
   Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. Associations
   between renal measures and sensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) and the
   impact of functional status were determined by multivariate linear
   models. Results. Based on standardized coefficients, cystatin C (beta
   0.19; p<0.001) showed the strongest association with CRP compared to
   creatinine (beta 0.14; p<0.001) and estimated GFR (beta -0.13; p<0.001).
   Levels of CRP linearly increased across quintiles of cystatin C, whereas
   for creatinine and estimated GFR the increase was less graded. Impaired
   physical functioning was strongly associated with elevated levels of
   cystatin C (p<0.001) and CRP (p<0.001), but not with creatinine (p=0.45)
   or estimated GFR (p=0.38). For persons with impaired physical
   functioning, the odds ratio for belonging to the highest compared to the
   lowest cystatin C quintile was 7.04 (95\% confidence interval 3.49-14.9;
   p<0.001), whereas for creatinine and estimated GFR this difference was
   not significant. Conclusion. The weaker association observed between CRP
   and creatinine-based measures, as compared to cystatin C, reflects the
   misclassification of elderly frail subjects as having normal kidney
   function rather than suggests cystatin C itself to be a marker of
   inflammation.}},

Journal = {{AGING MALE}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among
   many different populations all over the world, including the US and
   Europe. Its multitude of complications with devastating outcomes leads
   to a significantly higher risk for cardio-vascular and all-cause
   mortality in an individual. However, it is clear now that early
   detection of CKD might not only delay some of the complications but also
   prevent them. Therefore, various important public health organizations
   all over the world have turned their focus and attention to CKD and its
   risk factors, early detection and early intervention. Nevertheless, the
   general goals in preventing the increase in CKD and its complications
   are far from being completely achieved. Why is this so? What is the
   magnitude and complexity of the problem? How is it affecting the
   population - are there differences in its affection by age, gender or
   frail elderly versus the robust? Are we modifying the risk factors
   appropriately and aggressively? Are there subtle differences in managing
   the risk factors in those on dialysis versus the non-dialysis CKD
   patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of CKD aggressively, will it
   make a difference in the disease progression, its complications or to
   quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly succumb
   to? What do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire
   dialysis or transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment
   recommendations for those who refuse dialysis? What is the role of the
   physicians caring for the elderly with CKD? When should the primary care
   givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist? The key to eventually
   controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality, of life of
   affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other

Abstract = {{Elderly patients are the largest and fastest growing group of patients
   with chronic kidney disease maintained on dialysis in the world. Because
   of advanced age and a heavy burden of comorbidities, the elderly are
   usually not candidates for kidney transplantation and are less likely to
   be offered peritoneal dialysis (PD). There is, however, growing evidence
   that the use of community nurses to assist with PD and the introduction
   of programs for assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) targeting these
   frail, elderly patients may enable more elderly patients to have their
   PD treatment at home. Suitable candidates for aPD are incident end-stage
   kidney disease patients preferring PD but unable to perform their own
   treatment because of comorbidities, physical disabilities, or
   psychosocial problems; prevalent, previous autonomous PD patients who
   have lost their independence because of advanced age or an increased
   burden of comorbidities; or prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients
   switched from HD to aPD because of their own preference, failure of
   vascular access for HD, or an inability to tolerate HD. We believe that
   aPD in the future will prove to be a safe and feasible complementary
   alternative to in-center HD for the growing group of frail, elderly
   patients with end-stage kidney disease. (c) 2007 by the National Kidney

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper.. we propose a model for medical costs recorded at regular
   time intervals, e.g. every month, as repeated measures in the presence
   of a terminating event, such as death. Prior models have related monthly
   medical costs to time since entry, with extra costs at the final
   observations at the time of death. Our joint model for monthly medical
   costs and survival time incorporates two important new features. First,
   medical cost and survival may be correlated because more `frail'
   patients tend to accumulate medical costs faster and die earlier. A
   joint random effects model is proposed to account for the correlation
   between medical costs and survival by a shared random effect. Second,
   monthly medical costs usually increase during the time period prior to
   death because of the intensive care for dying patients. We present a
   method for estimating the pattern of cost prior to death, which is
   applicable if the pattern can be characterized as an additive effect
   that is limited to a fixed time interval, say b units of time before
   death. This `turn back time' method for censored observations censors
   cost data b units of time before the actual censoring time, while
   keeping the actual censoring time for the survival data. Time-dependent
   covariates can be included. Maximum likelihood estimation and inference
   are carried out through a Monte Carlo EM algorithm with a
   Metropolis-Hastings sampler in the E-step. An analysis of monthly
   outpatient EPO medical cost data for dialysis patients is presented to
   illustrate the proposed methods. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This study investigated mortality in 568 individuals from the Goessel
   Mennonite community in rural central Kansas. There were three main
   objectives to this research: 1) characterize mortality trends within a
   biologically well-defined Mennonite community; 2) determine what
   biochemical, morphological, and physiological risk factors could be
   related to all-cause mortality, stratified by age and sex; and 3)
   compare these results to previously described variables that were
   associated with both biological age and mortality in this population.
   Mortality data were obtained from three sources: Kansas Vital Records,
   the Social Security death index, and church records. In total, 221
   (39\%) individuals were found to have died in this population between
   January 1980-June 2002. Analogous to the larger US population, the three
   leading causes of death in this community were heart disease, cancer,
   and stroke, accounting for 60\% of all deaths. Besides advancing age,
   the greatest biological risk factor in this population was decreased
   amounts of albumin in men (relative risk, 2.47), potentially indicating
   underreported cases of either chronic kidney disease or frailty syndrome
   for males. Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated that increased
   amounts of total cholesterol may provide a protective effect for elderly
   individuals. We conclude, based on the previously described heritability
   of both albumin (h(2) = 0.40) and total cholesterol (h(2) = 0.50) in
   this population, that underlying genetic factors associated with both
   chronic degenerative diseases and biological aging may have important
   implications for understanding mortality patterns in this community.}},

Abstract = {{Age is well recognized as a powerful prognostic factor in the setting of
   cardiovascular disease. With the aging of the US population, it is
   projected that more than 50 million people will be aged over 65 years by
   the year 2020. This growing elderly population has increased rates of
   morbidity and mortality owing to cardiovascular disease; however, proven
   therapies for prevention and treatment are often underused in older
   patients, largely because physicians perceive them as being frail and
   have limited understanding of age-related unique adverse and therapeutic
   effects. Advancing age is associated with a number of physiologic and
   pathophysiologic changes that impact the toxic effects, efficacy and
   dosing of many medications. Decreases in lean muscle mass affect the
   volume of distribution, and reductions in hepatic function affect the
   metabolism of many medications. Age-related reductions in renal function
   might have the most profound impact on the safety profile and dosing of
   medications in elderly patients. The strong association between renal
   and cardiovascular disease makes recognition of renal dysfunction and
   appropriate dose adjustment particularly important in elderly patients

Title = {{Therapeutic failure-related hospitalisations in the frail elderly}},
Journal = {{DRUGS \& AGING}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{579-586}},
Abstract = {{Background and objective: Although therapeutic failure may be a common
   cause of drug-related morbidity in older adults, few studies have
   focused on this problem. The study objective was to determine the
   frequency and types of, and the factors associated with, therapeutic
   failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients, using a
   new instrument named the Therapeutic Failure Questionnaire (TFQ).
   Methods: The sample included 106 frail, hospitalised elderly patients
   enrolled in a I-year-long health service intervention trial at I I
   Veterans Affairs Medical Centres. The TFQ was developed by a team of
   clinicial geriatricians and tested for reliability by two clinical
   pharmacists and a geriatrician on a sample of 32 patients. To establish
   validity, a geriatrician retrospectively reviewed the computerised
   medication records and clinical charts for these patients and applied
   the TFQ to determine probable therapeutic failures at the time of
   hospital admission.
   Results: Inter- and intra-rater reliability for the TFQ were very good
   (kappa = 0.82 for both). Overall, 11\% of patients had one or more
   probable therapeutic failures (TFQ scores between 4 and 7) leading to
   hospitalisation. Cardiopulmonary disease was a common `indicator' of
   therapeutic failure and was often the result of non-adherence. The only
   factor associated with therapeutic failure occurrence was severe chronic
   kidney disease (crude odds ratio 5.87; 95\% CI 1.20, 28.69; p = 0.01).
   Conclusions: The TFQ was able to identify several cases of probable
   therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly
   patients. Non-adherence to effective therapies for chronic serious
   cardiopulmonary disease was a common cause of therapeutic failure and
   represents a target for interventions to reduce hospitalisation. Further
   research on the occurrence, risk factors for and types of therapeutic
   failure is needed in a larger cohort of older non-veterans.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent study of transplant outcomes, donor age, cerebrovascular
   accident as the cause of death (CVA), renal insufficiency (serum
   creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL), and history of hypertension have been
   identified as donor factors associated with elevated risk of kidney
   transplant failure. It is of great interest to know whether there remain
   other unmeasured donor factors associated with elevated risk of graft
   failure. In this article we study a sample of 6,024 deceased donor
   kidney transplants performed in 194 centers from 1995 to 2000. In
   addition to variation among transplant recipients, there are two other
   random effects: unmeasured donor and unrecorded center factors (data not
   available at the physician level). These two random effects are crossed,
   because the two kidneys from the same donor can be transplanted in
   different centers. Multivariate frailty models are applied to analyze
   the data. The likelihood functions of both parametric (e.g., with
   piecewise constant baseline hazard) and semiparametric multivariate
   frailty models are shown to be proportional to the likelihood functions
   of a class of mixed Poisson regression models. The penalized
   quasi-likelihood method is used as the numerical procedure for these
   mixed Poisson regression models. Thus we are able to estimate and model
   crossed random-effects structures for survival analysis. Although about
   30\% of recipient graft survival rate variation due to donor factors is
   explained by the measured donor characteristics, the remaining variation
   among donors in graft survival rate is still statistically significant,
   suggesting that there may be other unmeasured donor factors associated
   with a reduced graft survival rate. We also find significant variation
   of graft failure rates among transplant centers due to unrecorded center
   factors. Therefore, this study suggests that practice patterns at
   transplant centers and identification of other donor factors may merit
   further investigation.}},

   Result. Crude 1-year survival was 58\% and 2-year survival was 48\%.
   Crude 1- and 2-year survivals, excluding deaths within 90 days, were
   66\% and 54\% respectively. We found no significant effect on survival

Volume = {{65}},

Pages = {{649-653}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background. Renal function declines with age, but little is known about
   the extent of renal insufficiency among the institutionalized elderly.
   The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low
   glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a large sample of elderly adults
   living in long-term care facilities, and to compare two commonly used
   methods for estimating GFR.
   Methods. A total of 9931 residents aged 65 years and older participated
   in a retrospective cross-sectional study of 87 long-term care facilities
   in Ontario. GFR was estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault and Modification of
   Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) equations. The prevalence of low GFR,
   using the Cockcroft-Gault equation ( 30 mL/min), was compared with the
   MDRD equation (<30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)).
   Results. A total of 17.0\% (95\% CI 15.6 to 18.5) of men and 14.4\%
   (95\% CI 13.6 to 15.3) of women had a serum creatinine concentration
   above the laboratory reported upper reference limit of normal. The
   prevalence of both elevated serum creatinine and low GFR were observed
   to increase with age (P < 0.0001). The Cockcroft-Gault equation produced
   a consistently lower estimate of GFR than did the MDRD equation, a
   discrepancy most pronounced in the oldest residents. Among all men, a
   low GFR was more prevalent using the Cockcroft-Gault (10.3\%, 95\% CI
   9.2 to 11.5) than MDRD (3.5\%, 95\% CI 2.8 to 4.2) equation, with a
   similar difference also seen in women (23.3\%, 95\% CI 22.4 to 24.3
   versus 4.0\%, 95\% CI 3.6 to 4.5, respectively). Of all residents whose
   Cockcroft-Gault estimated GFR was under 30 mL/min, 14.7\% (95\% CI 13.2
   to 16.3) were found to have GFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)
   according to the MDRD equation.
   Conclusion. Age-associated renal impairment is common among elderly
   long-term care residents, but there exists a clear discrepancy between
   the Cockcroft-Gault and MDRD equations in predicting GFR. Consideration
   should be given to medication dose adjustment, based on a practical
   estimate of GFR. However clarification is needed about which method, if
   either, is most valid among the frail elderly. Complex patient and
   societal issues surrounding advanced care directives, treatments
   associated with renal insufficiency, and, if and when to initiate
   dialysis, require further attention.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of psychopathology, particularly depression, is high in

   population.
   Although the losses associated with advancing years, chronic disease and
   then entry into dialysis renders the psyche of elderly people frail,
   they do not strictly add in negative terms: their psychological reserve
   or resignation helps very elderly people to tolerate dialysis and its
   constraints.
   However, maintaining functional autonomy (ability to provide for one's
   fundamental needs and preserve leisure activities) while remaining
   independent to take decisions (particularly in controlling ways of
   receiving assistance) and preserving close relationships emerge as major
   determinant factors of the quality of life of very elderly dialysed
   patients. Added to the dependency due to dialysis, losses in these
   domains very often represent a turning point by changing the patient's
   identity, predisposing to the development of relationship problems,
   leading the patient to question his self-esteem or even resulting in

Journal = {{DISEASE MANAGEMENT \& HEALTH OUTCOMES}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{363-374}},
Abstract = {{As people live longer, chronic illness care will consume an ever-larger
   part of a nation's financial resources. With the `baby-boomer'
   generation reaching retirement age beginning in 2011, there will be an
   increased demand for chronic services/care in the population aged 65
   years and older. Innovative approaches to quality care must be sought,
   while understanding the financial costs associated with the delivery of
   such care to the geriatric population. Elderly persons utilize more
   physical resources and it is important to identify early those
   beneficiaries who would benefit medically from intervention.
   Disease management is built on a model of integrated care, with each
   member of the healthcare team working together toward a common set of
   objectives. The ultimate goal is to keep the patient functioning well in
   an outpatient setting, thus avoiding the high debility and costs
   associated with hospitalization and institutionalization. Creating such
   a system requires a substantial investment in infrastructure. The
   concept of `spending \$5.00 to save \$10.00' must be incorporated into
   the planning process. In chronically ill seniors there is a need for
   care as well as cure, which involves improving function and quality of
   life (QOL) for the frail elders by paying attention to the psychological
   and socioeconomic status in addition to the physical condition. Small
   gains in function can mean large gains in patients' QOL. Reducing the
   progression of functional decline among the physically frail who live at
   home is a goal. Home visits are a critical component of the total care
   delivered.
   Changing physician behavior to accept the tenets of disease management
   requires education in advance of launching such a program. There must be
   healthcare team buy-in for a program to achieve success. Personnel
   requirements include senior nurses, social workers, physical therapists
   and nutritionists, supported by a sophisticated information technology
   system. Components of an information technology system must allow for
   adequate data collection and subsequent generation of reports.
   Continuous quality improvement will occur only if such a system is in
   place.
   While the average chronologic age of the patient with end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) is almost 62 years, the physiologic age is much older.
   Therefore, ESRD serves as a model for chronic illness that affects a
   geriatric population and the benefits achieved by a disease management
   approach to this chronic disease are noted.
   Disease management improved glycemic control in the ESRD patient with
   diabetes mellitus by establishing a protocol for frequency of
   measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA(1c)). For this population
   at risk, a decreased hospitalization rate for diabetic complications
   resulted from this initiative. Also, a vascular access initiative in the
   described ESRD disease management program resulted in an increase in the
   creation of arterio-venous fistulas and a decrease in the placement of
   tunneled-cuff catheters. Fistula creation was associated with less
   infections and access thrombosis compared with catheter use for access.
   QOL improved for these patients with ESRD because of decreased
   hospitalization rate for access-related issues. Significant cost savings
   were achieved because of fewer hospital admissions and a decrease in the
   number of bed days per year.
   The lessons learned from the ESRD model can help in developing future
   disease management programs for the geriatric population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper charts the development of haemodialysis, the cornerstone of
   renal replacement therapy (RRT). It has enabled patients with end-stage
   renal failure to survive for years, in many cases with a surprisingly
   good quality of life. Through technological advances, RRT can be offered
   to patients who are older and more frail. Many have intercurrent
   comorbid illness. Such patients can have good quality of life, but their
   survival is shorter since they are likely to succumb early to comorbid
   illnesses. The challenge to nephrologists is to provide treatment based
   on exacting standards for all those patients who can benefit, yet to
   maintain cost-effectiveness. There is increasing recognition that,
   however good the technology underpinning dialysis, what justifies the
   cost and commitment that dialysis entails is the provision for the
   patient of a satisfactory quality of life.}},
