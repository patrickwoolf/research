N2  - Background: Patients who undergo transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are typically elderly and frail who have associated co-morbid conditions. As TAVR indications continue to evolve and its utilization has expanded to lower-risk cohorts, it is important to understand the factors that predict prolonged length of stay (LOS) in order to improve outcomes and systems efficiencies. Method: We conducted a retrospective review of our single center database from December 2011 to April 2018. 1884 patients were identified to undergo TAVR. Patients were examined based on their length of stay: LOS < 7 days versus LOS > 7 days. Patients and procedural factors were identified and examined. Results: African-Americans and Hispanics had prolonged stay of > 7 days compared to Caucasians. Patients with prior history of lung ds; end stage renal disease; prior history of myocardial infarction; and heart failure with NYHA class II, III, IV had longer LOS. Lower pre-procedural albumin and hemoglobin and higher creatinine predicted greater LOS. Patient with cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock also tended to stay longer in the ICU as well as the hospital. Patients with an in-hospital stay of > 7 days were associated with higher mortality at 30 days (7.3% vs 1%) (P value <0.00001). Moderate sedation and elective status of procedure were associated with shorter LOS. There was an overall temporal trend towards improvement in LOS over time. Conclusion: Longer LOS is associated with increased mortality. Patients with higher burden of co-morbid conditions succumb to longer inpatient stay. As we transition to low-risk TAVR, attention should be paid to patients with these risk factors in an effort to improve future outcomes.

N2  - Background: We retrospectively assessed the initial clinical role of preoperative frailty in surgical patients with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD). Methods: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients who underwent emergent or urgent surgical interventions for AAAD in our institute between April 2000 and March 2016 participated in this retrospective study. Patients with more than three of the following six modalities were defined as being frail: age older than 75 years, preoperative requirement of assistance in daily living, body mass index less than 18.5 kg/m2, female, history of major stroke, and chronic kidney disease greater than class 3b. Twenty-three patients (20.2%) were diagnosed with frailty (group F), while 91 patients (79.8%) were not (group N). Early clinical outcomes, major postoperative complications, postoperative recovery of activity, and early or mid-term survival were evaluated. Results: Although early clinical outcomes and the prevalence of major postoperative complications were similar in both groups, postoperative activity of daily living (ADL), such as the rate of being ambulatory on discharge (p < 0.05) and home discharge (p < 0.01), was significantly lower in group F than in group N. A Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that 1- and 5-year survival rates were similar in groups F (85.9 and 76.4%, respectively) and N (86.0 and 76.9%, respectively). Conclusions: Preoperative frailty in AAAD surgical patients has potential as a prognostic factor that affects delays in ADL recovery, but does not influence the early or mid-term clinical outcomes of prompt surgical strategies for life rescue in AAAD patients with frailty.

N2  - The incidence of end-stage renal disease has continued to increase. Similarly, the number of patients living with a functioning renal allograft has also increased. Transplantation has improved with advances in surgical techniques, immunosuppression, and better control of comorbid conditions. Transplantation is transformative and offers the greatest potential for restoring a healthy, productive, and durable life to appropriately selected patients. This article describes factors to address in selection of renal transplant candidates and discusses commonly encountered perioperative events. Paramount to selecting appropriate candidates is the collaboration between a multidisciplinary team focused on a systematic process guided by protocols and common practices.

N2  - Background Restoration of kidney function after kidney transplant generally improves cognitive function. It is unclear whether frail recipients, with higher susceptibility to surgical stressors, achieve such posttransplant cognitive improvements or whether they experience subsequent cognitive decline as they age with a functioning graft. Methods In this two-center cohort study, we assessed pretransplant frailty (Fried physical frailty phenotype) and cognitive function (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination) in adult kidney transplant recipients. To investigate potential short- and medium-term effects of frailty on post-transplant cognitive trajectories, we measured cognitive function up to 4 years post-transplant. Using an adjusted mixed effects model with a random slope (time) and intercept (person), we characterized post-transplant cognitive trajectories by pretransplant frailty, accounting for nonlinear trajectories. Results Of 665 recipients (mean age 52.0 years) followed for a median of 1.5 years, 15.0% were frail. After adjustment, pretransplant cognitive scores were significantly lower among frail patients compared with nonfrail patients (89.0 versus 90.8 points). By 3 months post-transplant, cognitive performance improved for both frail (slope =0.22 points per week) and nonfrail (slope =0.14 points per week) recipients. Between 1 and 4 years post-transplant, improvements plateaued among nonfrail recipients (slope =0.005 points per week), whereas cognitive function declined among frail recipients (slope =20.04 points per week). At 4 years post-transplant, cognitive scores were 5.8 points lower for frail recipients compared with nonfrail recipients. Conclusions On average, both frail and nonfrail recipients experience short-term cognitive improvement post-transplant. However, frailty is associated with medium-term cognitive decline post-transplant. Interventions to prevent cognitive decline among frail recipients should be identified.

N2  - Background: Several clinical and procedural factors determine outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but data are scarce on the impact of post-TAVR discharge disposition on long-term outcomes. We sought to analyse whether discharge location after TAVR is associated with 1-year outcomes in women undergoing contemporary TAVR. Methods: The Women's INternational Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (WIN-TAVI) registry is the first all-female TAVR registry to study the safety and performance of contemporary TAVR in women (n = 1019). Information on discharge location was available in 817 patients (80.2%). We compared women discharged home vs those discharged to another location (nursing home, rehabilitation, or other hospital). One-year outcomes were adjusted using multivariable Cox regression methods with discharge home as the reference group. Results: Of the study subjects, 75.2% (n = 614) were discharged home and 24.8% (n = 203) to another location. Women discharged to other locations were older with a greater prevalence of severe lung disease requiring home oxygen and renal failure on dialysis but were less frequently considered frail or at high surgical risk compared with women discharged home. After multivariable adjustment, non-home discharge was associated with greater hazard for 1-year Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 efficacy (21.3% vs 10.8%, hazards ratio [HR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.9) and safety endpoints (31.5% vs 15.2%, HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.0), cardiovascular death (12.7% vs 5.5%, HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6), and stroke (6.5% vs 0.8%, HR 8.5, 95% CI 2.9-25.6). Conclusions: In women undergoing contemporary TAVR, discharge disposition significantly affects 1-year risk of outcomes even after adjustment for recorded baseline differences. This might suggest the necessity of considering additional factors beyond comorbidities in the TAVR decision-making process.

N2  - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 2% to 4% of patients with severe aortic stenosis. It is because these patients have been excluded from clinical trials, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in this patient group has not been thoroughly investigated. Between April 2008 and March 2015, 2,000 patients (dialysis group, n = 56 [2.8%]) were consecutively enrolled when diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and eligible to undergo TAVI. Procedural and longer-term outcomes were analyzed and adjusted for differences in baseline characteristics. Patients on dialysis had a higher periprocedural mortality (10.7% vs 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 5.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.91 to 16.67; p = 0.002) and a lower Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-II (VARC) defined device success (adjOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.79; p = 0.012). At 30 days, there was an increased rate of all-cause mortality (21.4 vs 4.8%; adjOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.96 to 12.26; p = 0.001), cardiovascular (adjOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.41; p = 0.007) and noncardiovascular mortality (adjOR 6.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 9.41; p = 0.019), myocardial infarction (adjOR 9.39, 95% CI 1.84 to 48.03; p = 0.007), bleeding (adjOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.83; p = 0.036) as well as the VARC-II defined early safety combined end point (adjOR 2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.90; p = 0.012) associated with dialysis. Dialysis was associated with poor survival at one (57.1% vs 84.2%) and 3 years (26.8% vs 66.9%) with or without the consideration of the first 72 hours (p <0.001; adjusted p <0.001). Although, in the multivariable regression analysis, reduced ejection fraction, peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH), frailty and dialysis were associated with 1-year mortality, only PH (>60 mm Hg) remained significant in an analysis restricted to the dialysis patients (adjusted hazard ratio 2.68; 95% CI 1.18 to 5.88; p = 0.018). PH had a sensitivity of 45.8%, a specificity of 81.3%, and a positive predictive value of 64.7%. In conclusion, dialysis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who underwent TAVI. Long-term mortality in dialysis patients appears to be largely determined by the kidney disease and/or dialysis itself whereas VARC-II defined complications are largely unaffected. An increased short-term mortality still calls for (pre-) procedural optimization.

N2  - Frailty, a decreased physiologic response to stressors, is present in up to 35% of ESRD patients and is associated with falls, hospitalizations, poor cognitive function, and mortality. Also, frailty is associated with poor outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. It is likely frailty is associated with decreased access to kidney transplantation given poor outcomes on dialysis and after transplant. Methods: We studied 7,078 KT candidates (2009-2018) in a three-center cohort study of frailty. We estimated time to listing, waitlist mortality, and transplant rate using adjusted Cox proportional hazards, competing risks, and Poisson regression. Results: The mean age was 54 years (SD=13), 40.2% were female, 33.9% were African American, and 21 .1% were frail. Frail participants were less likely to be listed for kidney transplant (adjusted hazard ratio:0.62,95%CI:0.56-0.69,p<0.001) compared to nonfrail participants. Also, once listed, frail candidates had a 1.7-fold increased risk of waitlist mortality while awaiting transplantation (adjusted subhazard ratio:1.69,95%CI:1.35- 2 .13,p<0.001), independent of age, race, and sex. Furthermore, frail candidates were transplanted 35% less frequently than nonfrail candidates (adjusted incidence rate ratio:0.65,95%CI:0.55-0.77,p<0.001). Conclusions: Frailty is associated with decreased listing, increased waitlist mortality, and decreased rate of transplant, regardless of age and sex. Frailty is a modifiable risk factor, and assessment at kidney transplant evaluation can help guide patient counseling for candidates all of all ages and motivate strategies to improve pre-KT outcomes.

N2  - Purpose: Frailty develops earlier and advances at an accelerated rate in patients receiving haemodialysis. Outcomes for these patients are poor and include increased risk of falls and fracture. The aim of this study was to explore haemodialysis patients’ experiences of living with frailty and falls. This information is crucial to enhancing patient safety and care, and to inform tailored interventions to improve outcomes. Methods: A purposive sample of vulnerable or frail (Clinical Frailty Scale, CFS Score 4-9) adult haemodialysis patients who had experienced at least one fall within the last six months were recruited. In-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a constant comparative approach. Results: Ten participants with a mean age of 65 (±12) years, who had experienced 5 (±5) falls within the last 6 months, were interviewed. Exhaustion and weakness were the most prevalent characteristics of frailty, which led to ‘slowing down’ and low levels of physical activity, worsened by hospital admissions and inactivity during haemodialysis. Unintentional weight loss was more complex. Some participants reported gaining weight due to fluid overload, whilst others reported weight loss that was attributed to forgetting or choosing not to eat and difficulties with following a renal diet. Participants attributed their falls to multiple factors, particularly weakness and hypotension. Balance dysfunction, particularly whilst walking outdoors, negotiating stairs and slopes, turning and performing multiple tasks simultaneously, was also common. Falls were rarely reported and often normalised. Those participants who did discuss their falls with the healthcare team likened their attempts to ‘talking to the wall’, with concerns being ignored or explained away. None of the participants interviewed had been referred to a falls clinic or prevention programme. Consequences of falling included; fracture, damage to their dialysis access, long-term musculoskeletal complications, pain, loss of confidence and disruption to the wider family. Participants predominantly used problem-focused strategies to help them to live with frailty and falls, primarily relying upon family support, adapting challenging activities and exercising (particularly walking and resistance exercise). Emotion-focused coping was used to a lesser extent and included avoidance, practicing gratitude and acceptance. Not all these strategies appeared to result in positive adaptation or prevention of further falls. Conclusion(s): This is the first study to describe the experiences of frail, falling haemodialysis patients. Although the sample size is small, this study suggests that existing health services could be improved by routinely screening for frailty and regularly enquiring about falls. Further research is needed to confirm the factors identified as contributing to frailty and falls, and to develop and test tailored interventions which address these factors and enable patients to build resilience by enhancing positive coping strategies. Implications: Physiotherapists involved in the care of patients receiving haemodialysis should routinely screen for frailty, ask about falls and refer to rehabilitation services. Involving family in care decisions, and utilising empathetic communication, may also improve patients’ experiences. Approaches to physiotherapy that foster positive coping mechanisms and build resilience may be more beneficial than those that encourage reliance on adaptations and aids.

N2  - There is interdependence between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ageing whereby CKD makes ageing more accelerated and pronounced, whereas ageing accelerates chronic nephropathy’s progression. Frailty status catalyzes this spiral, with renal and systemic negative consequences, and this condition can currently be documented by applying already validated clinical scores (frailty phenotype) or physical test (gate speed). Although, nephroprevention strategies are similar between young adult and senior CKD patients, standard targets should be adequate to very old and frail elderly individuals. For this purpose, an original algorithm is here proposed to adjust the conventional nephroprevention strategies to the condition of CKD frail patient (more relaxed targets and tighter control), as well as to prescribe anti-frailty interventions to slow patient’s functional decline, hospitalization and mortality.

N2  - Currently, there are no tools to predict postsurgery outcome after kidney transplantation. This study assesses whether frailty influence 30-day postoperative complications after kidney transplantation. One-hundred and fifty kidney transplantations were prospectively included. Frailty was assessed using a frailty indicator, consisting of 15 questions, covering most domains of functioning. Postoperative complications were measured by the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Using a linear regression model, 30-day postoperative complications and frailty correlation were adjusted for confounders, including sex, age, ASA Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, BMI, smoking, dialysis, duration of dialysis, type of transplantation, and retransplantation. The mean frailty score was 2.07(±1.6) and 23 patients were classified as frail (GFI ≥4). The mean CCI-score was 18(±15.6), the mean CCI-score for “frail” patients 30.1(±17.2) compared to 15.5 (±14.2) for “non-frail” patients (N = 116). In a regression analysis, a significant relationship between CCI-score and frailty (β = 13.3; 95% CI 5.7–20.9; P = 0.0007) and transplantation type (β = 4.9; 95% CI: 0.72–9.16; P = 0.02) was found, independent of confounders. In conclusion, frailty and type of transplantation are independent factors associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications.

N2  - Background: While the 11-factor modified frailty index (mFI) has been shown to predict adverse outcomes in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty, the 5-factor index has not been evaluated in this patient population. The goal of this study was to evaluate the utility of the mFI-5 as a predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing primary total hip and knee arthroplasty. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program's database for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty between the years 2005 and 2016 was conducted. The 5-factor score, which includes the presence of comorbid diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and functional status, was calculated for each patient. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between the mFI-5 and postoperative complications while controlling for demographic variables. Results: One hundred forty thousand one hundred fifty-eight patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and 226,398 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were identified. After adjusting for demographic variables and comorbid conditions, logistic regression analyses revealed that the mFI-5 was a strong predictor for total complications, Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, septic shock, pulmonary embolism, postoperative dialysis, reintubation, and prolonged ventilator requirement), surgical site infections, readmission, and 30-day mortality (P <.001). Conclusions: The mFI-5 is an independent predictor of postoperative complications including life-threatening medical complications, surgical site infections, hospital readmission, and 30-day mortality after primary hip and knee arthroplasty. This clinical tool can be used to identify high-risk surgical patients and guide preoperative counseling to optimize outcomes. Level of Evidence: III.

N2  - Aim: A recent, growing concern regarding haemodialysis in Japan is a sustained increase in the elderly population. Among very elderly people who start haemodialysis, the prognosis is considered to be poor; however, this has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to discover the short-term prognosis and related factors in very elderly patients who commence haemodialysis. Methods: Between January 2008 and December 2013, 122 patients aged ≥85 years at haemodialysis initiation were documented in our hospital. Predictors of 90-day and 1-year mortality after haemodialysis initiation were assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Selection of covariates for the multivariate model was based on forward stepwise selection using the probability of a likelihood ratio statistics. Results: The subjects’ mean age was 87.4 ± 2.5 years, and 48% were female. The most common cause of death was infection (38% of patients) and the leading cause of infectious death was pneumonia. The 90-day and 1-year survival rates were 81% and 62%, respectively. Suboptimal initiation was a significant prognostic factor for 90-day [hazard ratio (HR) 3.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18–13.43] and 1-year [HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.51–6.76] mortality after adjusting for confounders in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Very elderly patients who started haemodialysis had a poor prognosis, and suboptimal initiation significantly predicted outcome. Shared decision-making with patients and their families is needed for initiating haemodialysis on the conditions that appropriate information on the expected prognosis is provided.

N2  - Background: Age is no longer a limit to kidney transplantation (KT) access for patients with end stage renal disease, but recipients older age and frailty are associated with poor outcome after KT, especially hospitalizations for complications. Pre-KT comorbidity, polypharmacy and sarcopenia could be contributors to frailty. Our objective was to identify factors associated with a high number of days of hospitalizations during the first year post-KT. Methods: Recipients older than 70 years who underwent KT between 2009 and 2016 in our center were included in this retrospective study. The burden of complications was assessed by the number of days of hospitalization during the first year post-KT. We tested pre-KT comorbidities, polypharmacy and sarcopenia, as well as KT characteristics, as potential factors associated with post-KT complications. Muscle mass was assessed by measuring the L4 psoas area on abdominal computed tomography. Results: A hundred and thirteen patients were included. Median (range) age was 74 (70-85). Median (IQR) number of days of hospitalization during the first year post-KT was 32 (20-46). 5-year patient survival with a functioning graft was lower in recipients hospitalized more than 32 days during the first year post-KT (p = 0.02). Pre-KT polypharmacy >5 and 10 drugs was the only factor associated with a number of days of hospitalization higher than the median (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.2-14.3 and 8.3, 95% CI 2.3-36.7, respectively), even after adjusting for age and Charlson comorbidity index in a multivariate analysis. Low muscle mass was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. Conclusion: In older KT recipients, pre-transplant polypharmacy is associated with post-transplant complications and hospitalizations, independently of comorbidity. Pre-KT geriatric interventions should be implemented to reduce polypharmacy.

N2  - Prehabilitation is the process of enhancing preoperative functional capacity to improve tolerance for the upcoming stressor; it was associated with improved postoperative outcomes in a handful of studies, but never evaluated in transplantation. Kidney transplant (KT) candidates may be uniquely suited for prehabilitation because they experience a profound loss of functional capacity while waiting years on dialysis. To better understand the feasibility and effectiveness of prehabilitation in KT, we conducted a pilot study of center-based prehabilitation for candidates; this intervention consisted of weekly physical therapy sessions at an outpatient center with at-home exercises. We enrolled 24 participants; 18 participated in prehabilitation (75% of enrolled; 17% of eligible). 61% were male, 72% were African American, and mean age = 52 (SD = 12.9); 71% of participants had lower-extremity impairment, and 31% were frail. By 2 months of prehabilitation, participants improved their physical activity by 64% (P = 0.004) based on accelerometry. Participants reported high satisfaction. Among 5 prehabilitation participants who received KT during the study, length of stay was shorter than for age-, sex-, and race-matched control (5 vs 10 days; RR = 0.69; 95% CI:0.50-0.94; P = 0.02). These pilot study findings suggest that prehabilitation is feasible in pretransplant patients and may potentially be a strategy to improve post-KT outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Haemodialysis patients are at an increased risk of sarcopenia. Physical inactivity is now recognised as a major cause of muscle wasting in haemodialysis patients. It is unclear as to what and how much exercise is required to show benefit. We therefore performed a pilot study of cycling during haemodialysis. Methods: Patients underwent a progressive submaximal individualised cycling exercise, 3× a week during haemodialysis for 4 months using bed-cycle ergometers. Body composition was measured by multifrequency segmental bioimpedance and muscle function by 6-min walking test, and hand grip strength and pinch strength. Results: In total, 56% of patients in a dialysis centre fulfilled exercise study inclusion criteria and 13 (72.2%) of 18 patients completed the exercise programme, with the mean age of 64.0 ± 16.6 years and 76.9% being male. The 6-min walking test increased following exercise from 349 ± 105 to 398 ± 94.2 m, p < 0.05, as did both hand grip strength and pinch strength, with 20.4 ± 9.1 versus 23.4 ± 9.9 kg, p < 0.01, and 4.3 ± 1.8 versus 5.9 ± 2.4 kg, p < 0.05, respectively. There were no changes in appendicular muscle mass or other body composition detected with bioimpedance in either the exercise group, or 21 control patients, propensity matched for body composition, comorbidity and frailty. Muscle strength did not change in the control group. Haemodialysis sessional Kt/Vurea was greater at the end of the exercise programme compared to controls (1.63 ± 0.63 vs 1.21 ± 0.12, p < 0.01). Conclusion: The majority of dialysis centre patients met our exercise study entry criteria and could potentially benefit from cycling during haemodialysis. We found that muscle function and strength improved after a 4-month, thrice weekly cycling exercise programme.

N2  - Purpose: Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common abnormality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Since the introduction of cinacalcet in 2004, a shift from surgery toward predominantly medical treatment has occurred. Surgery is thought to be associated with more complications than oral medication. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate 30-day outcomes and effectiveness of parathyroidectomy (PTx) in ESRD patients in the Netherlands. Methods: A national database containing data from four academic medical centers in the Netherlands of patients with ESRD-related HPT, who had undergone PTx and kidney transplantation between 1994 and 2015, was established. Primary endpoints were 30-day mortality and complication rate. Secondary endpoints were biochemical measurements. Results: We identified 187 HPT patients undergoing PTx, with a median age of 46 years. Median preoperative PTH level was 866 pg/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 407–1547 pg/mL). At 3 months, the median PTH drop from baseline was 93% (IQR, 71–98%) to a median of 61 pg/mL (IQR, 23–148 pg/mL, p < 0.001). Over the 25-year inclusion period, 13 patients (7.0%) required re-exploration for persistent or recurrent disease. Thirty-day mortality and complication rate were 0.0% and 7.9% respectively. Median serum calcium levels improved significantly postoperatively from 2.6 (2.4–2.8) mmol/L to 2.3 (2.1–2.5) mmol/L (p < 0.001). Conclusions: PTx is a safe and effective procedure in the frail ESRD population. These data show that there should be no reluctance for surgical intervention and when indicated, nephrologists can safely refer these patients for PTx.

N2  - Aim: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty, but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited. Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not (Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined the risk factors for frailty. Results: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients (n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty. Conclusions: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 1597–1602.

N2  - Background: Frailty assessment is recommended to evaluate the candidacy of adults referred for orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). Psoas muscle area (PMA) is an easily measured biomarker for frailty. There has yet to be a study examining the prognostic impact of PMA in OHT patients. Methods: In this retrospective study, preoperative and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were retrieved for adults transplanted between 2000 and 2015 at a tertiary care hospital. Psoas muscle area was measured on a single axial image. Outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality over 6 years and a composite of in-hospital mortality or major morbidity (prolonged ventilation, stroke, dialysis, mediastinitis, or reoperation). Results: Of 161 adult patients transplanted, 82 had at least 1 abdominal CT scan. At baseline, mean PMA was 25.7 ± 5.8 cm2 in men and 16.0 ± 3.6 cm2 in women, and decreased by 8% from the first to the last available CT scan. Adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and cardiomyopathy etiology, every 1-cm2 increase in PMA was found to be associated with a 9% reduction in long-term mortality (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83-0.99; P = 0.031) and a 17% reduction in in-hospital mortality or major morbidity (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.96; P = 0.014). When PMA was smaller than the sex-specific median, the risk of mortality or major morbidity increased fourfold (odds ratio, 4.29; 95% CI, 1.19-15.46; P = 0.026). Conclusions: Muscle mass is an independent predictor of mortality and major morbidity after OHT. Further research is needed to determine whether frail OHT patients with low PMA may benefit from muscle-building interventions to improve outcomes.

N2  - Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is rare and characterized endoscopically by distal esophageal ulceration, blackening, and necrosis. It typically arises in patients with multiple comorbidities who have significant systemic disease and frailty. Specific precipitating events are variable. Evidence suggests a multifactorial etiology likely involving esophageal ischemia in the setting of corrosive injury from gastric contents and impaired tissue repair mechanisms. In the transplant setting, immunosuppression likely plays a substantial role. We report a case of AEN in a 70-year-old man following a renal transplant.

N2  - Motor functions are deteriorated by aging. Some conditions may magnify this deterioration. This study examined whether hemodialysis (HD) process would negatively impact gait and balance beyond diabetes condition among mid-age adults (48⁻64 years) and older adults (65+ years). One hundred and ninety-six subjects (age = 66.2 ± 9.1 years, body-mass-index = 30.1 ± 6.4 kg/m2, female = 56%) in 5 groups were recruited: mid-age adults with diabetes undergoing HD (Mid-age HD+, n = 38) and without HD (Mid-age HD-, n = 40); older adults with diabetes undergoing HD (Older HD+, n = 36) and without HD (Older HD-, n = 37); and non-diabetic older adults (Older DM-, n = 45). Gait parameters (stride velocity, stride length, gait cycle time, and double support) and balance parameters (ankle, hip, and center of mass sways) were quantified using validated wearable platforms. Groups with diabetes had overall poorer gait and balance compared to the non-diabetic group (p < 0.050). Among people with diabetes, HD+ had significantly worsened gait and balance when comparing to HD- (Cohen's effect size d = 0.63⁻2.32, p < 0.050). Between-group difference was more pronounced among older adults with the largest effect size observed for stride length (d = 2.32, p < 0.001). Results suggested that deterioration in normalized gait speed among HD+ was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.404, p < 0.001), while this correlation was diminished among HD-. Interestingly, results also suggested that poor gait among Older HD- is related to poor ankle stability, while no correlation was observed between poor ankle stability and poor gait among Older HD+. Using objective assessments, results confirmed that the presence of diabetes can deteriorate gait and balance, and this deterioration can be magnified by HD process. Among HD- people with diabetes, poor ankle stability described poor gait. However, among people with diabetes undergoing HD, age was a dominate factor describing poor gait irrespective of static balance. Results also suggested feasibility of using wearable platforms to quantify motor performance during routine dialysis clinic visit. These objective assessments may assist in identifying early deterioration in motor function, which in turn may promote timely intervention.

N2  - Context: It has become commonplace to use family caregivers as proxy responders where patients are unable to provide information about their symptoms and concerns to health care providers. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the degree of concordance between patients' and family members' reports of patient symptoms and concerns at end of life. Methods: Sample dyads included a mix of patients residing at home, in a nursing home, in a long-term care facility, or in hospice. Diagnoses included patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 75), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 52), end-stage renal disease (n = 42), and institutionalized, cognitively intact frail elderly (n = 49). Dyads completed the Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI), the modified Structured Interview Assessment of Symptoms and Concerns in Palliative Care, and Graham and Longman's two-item Quality of Life Scale. Results: Concordance was less than 70% for seven of the 25 PDI items, with the lowest concordance (65.1%) for the item “not being able to continue with my usual routines.” For all but one PDI item, discordance was in the direction of family members reporting that the patient was worse off than the patient had indicated. Where discordance was observed on the Structured Interview Assessment of Symptoms and Concerns in Palliative Care and Quality of Life Scales, the trend toward family members overreporting patient distress and poor quality of life continued. Conclusion: Understanding discordance between patients and family member reports of symptoms and concerns is a valuable step toward minimizing patient and family burden at end of life.

N2  - Aging is an important risk factor for patients with atrial fibrillation. The estimated prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients aged ≥80 years is 9–10%, and is associated with a four to five fold increased risk of embolic stroke, and with an estimated increased stroke risk of 1.45-fold per decade in aging. Older age is also associated with an increased risk of major bleeding with oral anticoagulant therapy. This review will focus on the role of oral anticoagulation with new oral anticoagulants, non-vitamin K antagonist in populations with common comorbid conditions, including age, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, on multiple medication, and frailty. In patients 75 years and older, randomised trials have shown new oral anticoagulants to be as effective as warfarin, or in some cases superior, with an overall better safety profile, consistently reducing rates of intracranial haemorrhages. Prior to considering oral anticoagulant therapy in an elderly frail patient, a comprehensive assessment should be performed to include the risks and benefits, stroke risk, baseline kidney function, cognitive status, mobility and fall risk, multiple medication, nutritional status assessment, and life expectancy.

N2  - ♦ Background: It is known that sarcopenia is related to mal-nutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis (MIA) syndrome and is an important problem in dialysis patients. The notion of frailty includes various physical, psychological, and social aspects. Although it has been reported that sarcopenia is associated with poor prognosis in patients with hemodialysis, reports on peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are rare. In this study, we examined the morbidity and mortality of sarcopenia and frailty in PD patients. We also investigated the MIA-related factors. ♦Methods: We evaluated 119 patients cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria and the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) were used to diagnose sarcopenia and frailty. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality with sarcopenia and frailty. The secondary outcome is the relationship between various MIA-related factors. ♦ Results: Morbidity of sarcopenia and frailty in PD patients was 8.4% and 10.9%, respectively. Old age, high values of Barthel Index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, CFS, and low values of body mass index (BMI), muscle strength, muscle mass, and slow walking were associated with sarcopenia. Interleukin-6, albumin, and prealbumin were significantly correlated with muscle mass. During follow-up, the presence of sarcopenia or frailty was associated with the risk of mortality. In multivariate analysis, CFS was related to the mortality rate of PD patients. ♦ Conclusions: The presence of sarcopenia or frailty was associated with a worse prognosis.

N2  - The fact that these patients are often old and frail means that they require special attention. In this population, the main cause of mortality is cardiovascular disease followed by infection. Moreover, progress remains to be done in terms of the dietary management of these patients given that hypoalbuminaemia and nutritional status are significant prognostic factors of mortality with dialysis. It is in these three areas which have an impact on survival that the pharmacist can support the nephrologist, by assuring in particular drug compatibility.

N2  - Background: Hospitalizations in patients are the major cause of morbidity and healthcare expenditure in patients with cirrhosis. Predictive factors determining which outpatients with cirrhosis are at highest risk for unplanned admissions are lacking.The Clinical Frailty Scale a rapid 1 min screen has shown excellent prognostic utility, but not been evaluated extensively in Indian high-risk cirrhosis outpatients.We aimed to study factors & utility of Clinical Frailty scale (CFS) in outpatients with cirrhosis in predicting hospitalization or/and death at 3 Months. Methods: Prospective Observational study with all the assessment carried out on the same day with study population comprising consecutive outpatients with cirrhosis in a single Tertiary care centre. Patients with active malignancy, ESRD & any condition requiring immediate admission were excluded. Frailty was defined as Clinical frailty scale (CFS) > 4.Unplanned hospitalization was defined as any admission to acute care hospital that was not planned. Data on MELD, CHILD score,Previous hospitalization,β-blockers and AKI (ICA criteria) & Charlson comorbidity index were recorded. The outcome was defined as unplanned hospitalization or/ and death at 1 and 3 months from study entry. Variables found to be significant were used for Binary backward logistic regression (Entry criteria p<0.05 exit p>0.1). Results: Overall 124 patients included, 52(41.9%) were frail, Etiology was predominantly alcohol 63/124 (51%) followed by HBV 30/124 (24%) then NASH 12/124(16.7%) related cirrhosis. Mean MELD was 20 and CTP score was 10.6 in frail patients.CFS mean value was 5.2 with CRP mean of 3.2 mg/dl in frail outpatients. 26/52 (50%) of frail patients as compared to 2/72 (2.8%) non-frail patients had unplanned hospitalization at 1 month whereas 44/52(84.6%) as compared to 11/72(15.3%) had unplanned hospitalization at 3 months. 9/52 (17.3 %) frail patients died in comparison to only 1/72(1.46%) in the non-Frail group at 3 months. On Univariate regression analysis variables found to have p values <0.05 were considered for Multivariate cox regression analysis. Multivariate Binary logistic regression (Backward LR) patients taking Propranolol more than 20 mg with P<0.07, OR 7.16( CI 1.73-29.6) , Frail patients with CFS>4 P<0.01, OR:5.38(CI: 1.3-21.6), Presence of AKI with P<0.006 , OR:17.24 (CI:2.2-133.7), CRP > 2 mg/dl with P<0.001, OR:11.23 (CI:2.6-47) were found to independently predict unplanned admission at 1 month and unplanned admission/death at 3 months. We also observed that CRP with a cut-off of 2mg/dl with sensitivity of 77.5% and specificity of 92.42 % with AUC of 0.88 predicted unplanned hospitalization/death at 3 months.Conclusion: Clinical frailty scale as rapid 1-minute screen & Serum CRP with a cut-off 2mg/dl predicts unplanned hospitalization and/or death at 3 months and can be utilized in outpatients with cirrhosis for stratifying patients at risk of adverse outcomes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION. The MFI is a composite summary instrument widely used to assess frailty and is associated with outcomes in hospitalized patients. However, studies evaluating MFI use in ICU patients are still scarce. OBJECTIVES. To evaluate the association of the MFI hospital mor-tality and resource use in a large cohort of critically ill patients. METHODS. Retrospective cohort study in 129,680 admitted to 93 Brazilian ICUs during 2014 and 2015. MFI encompasses 11 domains related to frailty (comorbidities, previous acute complications and functional capacity) in a 0-11 scale. Using MFI, we classified patients in no-frail (0), pre-frail (1-2) and frail (≥3). Primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were use of organ support during ICU stay, ICU and hospital LOS, and hospital discharge needing nursing care. We used multivariable mixed regression modeling to assess the association between MFI and the outcomes adjusting for confouders. RESULTS. There were 40,779 (32%) no-frail, 64,407 (50%) pre-frail and 24,494 (18%) frail patients. Frail patients were older, more frequently admitted for non-surgical reasons and had higher illness severity. Frail patients had higher hospital mortality (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.89-3.08); this association was more pronounced in patients with lower illness severity (Figure). Frail patients were more frequently discharged in need of nursing care (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.26-2.75), required more often mechanical ventilation (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.05-1.75), dialysis (OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.76-4.61), vaso-pressors (OR 1.84, CI 95% 1.45-2.35) and blood transfusion (OR 1.69, CI 95% 1.43-2.01) during the ICU stay. Frail patients had higher ICU and hospital LOS, with lower hazard for discharge (hazard for ICU and hospital discharge of 0.94; 95% CI 0.92-0.96 and 0.79; 95% CI 0.78-0.81). CONCLUSIONS. The MFI seems an interesting surrogate marker for frailty in large studies in ICU patients. Using this instrument, frailty was independently associated with short term outcomes and re-source use in these patients.

N2  - Under normal conditions, inflammation is a protective and physiological response to various harmful stimuli. However, in several chronic debilitating disorders, such as chronic kidney disease, inflammation becomes maladaptive, uncontrolled and persistent. Systemic persistent inflammation has, for almost 20 years, been recognized as a major contributor to the uraemic phenotype (such as cardiovascular disease, protein energy wasting, depression, osteoporosis and frailty), and a predictor of cardiovascular and total mortality. Since inflammation is mechanistically related to several ageing processes (inflammageing), it may be a major driver of a progeric phenotype in the uraemic milieu. Inflammation is likely the consequence of a multifactorial aetiology and interacts with a number of factors that emerge when uraemic toxins accumulate. Beside interventions aiming to decrease the production of inflammatory molecules in the uraemic milieu, novel strategies to increase the removal of large middle molecules, such as expanded haemodialysis, may be an opportunity to decrease the inflammatory allostatic load associated with retention of middlemolecular weight uraemic toxins.

N2  - This article is a continuation of our previously published annual reviews of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). In 2017, TAVR further established a foothold in the management of intermediate risk patients with the publication of SURTAVI trial. Randomized trials also addressed the use of cerebral protection during TAVR and single versus dual antiplatelet therapy after TAVR. Newer generation valve systems continued to be studied for their efficacy and safety. This paper summarizes the major studies published in 2017.

N2  - In patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, TAVR resulted in reduced length of stay, hospitalization cost, complication rate and higher rates of home discharge compared to SAVR. In-hospital mortality and complication rates were high in both groups. Careful patient selection and further research is required to identify patients with end-stage renal disease who might, or might not, benefit from intervention.

N2  - Introduction Gastrointestinal amyloidosis (GIA), a protein deposition disorder, represents a complex common pathway that encompasses multiple etiologies and presentations. It represents a significant diagnostic and treatment challenge. We report a rare such case with gastric and hepatic involvement presenting with GI bleed. Case Report A 68-year-old male admitted with complaints of loss of appetite and weight loss of 10 kg in 6 months. He was hypertensive on medications. Basic blood investigations were within normal limits. USG abdomen - hepatosplenomegaly, CECT abdomen - coarse echotexture of liver, splenomegaly, multiple anterior abdominal wall collaterals and periportal lymphadenopathy. Upper GI endoscopy - thickened gastric mucosa, superficial ulcers, and active diffuse oozing of blood wherever the scope touches the mucosa (extreme friability), small duodenal submucosal nodule also noted. Gastric and duodenal nodule biopsy was suggestive of amyloidosis, Congo red staining was positive for classic green birefringence under polarized light. Serum protein electrophoresis and bone marrow aspiration were negative for myeloma. He was treated conservatively. Discussion The disease results from the deposition of insoluble extracellular protein fragments that have been rendered resistant to digestion. GIAcan be acquired or genetic, and most commonly results from chronic inflammatory disorders (AA), hematologicmalignancy (AL), and ESRD (Beta-2). Within GI tract, amyloid deposition occurs in the muscularis mucosae, within close proximity to vasculature, nerves, and nerve plexuses. This deposition increases the frailty of blood vessels, hinders intrinsic peristalsis and decreases the compliance of the gut wall. Treatment is based on addressing the underlying etiology for elevated amyloid precursors and most often involves chemotherapy or biologic therapy. Prognosis depends on subtype. AL subtype typically shows worse prognosis than AA subtype, and those with GI involvement typically have worse outcomes. Conclusion GIA is a rare entity, diagnosis depends on clinical acumen, high index of suspicion and histopathology.

N2  - Depressive symptoms and frailty are each independently associated with morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. We hypothesized that having both depressive symptoms and frailty would be synergistic and worse than the independent effect of each. In a multicenter cohort study of 773 KT recipients, we measured the Fried frailty phenotype and the modified 18-question Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Using adjusted Poisson regression and survival analysis, we tested whether depressive symptoms (CES-D score > 14) and frailty were associated with KT length of stay (LOS), death-censored graft failure (DCGF), and mortality. At KT admission, 10.0% of patients exhibited depressive symptoms, 16.3% were frail, and 3.6% had both. Recipients with depressive symptoms were more likely to be frail (aOR = 3.97, 95% CI: 2.28-6.91, P < 0.001). Recipients with both depressive symptoms and frailty had a 1.88 times (95% CI: 1.70-2.08, P < 0.001) longer LOS, 6.20-fold (95% CI:1.67-22.95, P < 0.01) increased risk of DCGF, and 2.62-fold (95% CI:1.03-6.70, P = 0.04) increased risk of mortality, compared to those who were nonfrail and without depressive symptoms. There was only evidence of synergistic effect of frailty and depressive symptoms on length of stay (P for interaction < 0.001). Interventions aimed at reducing pre-KT depressive symptoms and frailty should be explored for their impact on post-KT outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE/PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for their applicability and acknowledgement of major issues related to multimorbidity in older adults. Although clinicians strive to be evidence-based in their decisions, prior CPGs have had limited applicability to older adults with multimorbidity. This problem was first highlighted in a 2005 JAMA study. This project sought to identify if newer CPGs better addressed older adults and multimorbidity. METHODS: Using Medicare data from 2015, the top 15 diagnoses among Americans over the age of 65 years were identified and nine national major CPGs were selected for review: hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), osteoarthritis (OA), stable ischemic heart disease (SIDH), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), depression, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Two investigators individually assessed each CPG to identify if they addressed older patients, comorbidities, older patients with comorbidities, time to benefit, or made specific recommendations for patients with either a single comorbid condition or multiple comorbidities. For consistency purposes, the investigators focused on whether the CPG provided information to effectively guide patient care in complex older adults. RESULTS: CPG for HTN, HLD, DM, and depression addressed issues with older adults. While all nine guidelines identified comorbidity-related problems, only the DM and depression CPGs addressed older adults with comorbidities, usually a single comorbidity. Time to benefit, a major treatment consideration for older adults, was specifically addressed only by the CPGs for SIHD, HFrEF and depression. CONCLUSIONS: When using CPGs, clinicians must consider all patient factors including age and comorbidities. CPGs may not be useful for those treating a frail elderly population because of the lack of acknowledgment of both elderly patients and patients with comorbidities. Since the 2005 JAMA report, CPGs still infrequently address older adults with multimorbidity.

N2  - Pain is one of the most common symptoms among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and is often under recognized and not adequately managed in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Barriers to adequate pain management include poor awareness of the problem, insufficient medical education, fears of possible drug-related side effects, and common misconceptions about the inevitability of pain in elderly and HD patients. Caregivers working in HD should be aware of the possible consequences of inadequate pain assessment and management. Common pain syndromes in HD patients include musculoskeletal diseases and metabolic neuropathies, associated with typical intradialytic pain. Evaluating the etiology, nature, and intensity of pain is crucial for choosing the correct analgesic. A mechanism-based approach to pain management may result in a better outcome. Pharmacokinetic considerations on clearance alterations and possible toxicity in patients with ESRD should drive the right analgesic prescription. Comorbidities and polymedications may increase the risk of drug–drug interactions, therefore drug metabolism should be taken into account when selecting analgesic drugs. Automedication is common among HD patients but should be avoided to reduce the risk of hazardous drug administration. Further research is warranted to define the efficacy and safety of analgesic drugs and techniques in the context of patients with ESRD as generalizing information from studies conducted in the general population could be inappropriate and potentially dangerous. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for the management of complex pain syndromes in frail patients, such as those suffering from ESRD.

N2  - Purpose: Frail patients are known to experience poor outcomes. Nevertheless, we know less about how frailty manifests itself in patients’ physiology during critical illness and how it affects resource use in intensive care units (ICU). We aimed to assess the association of frailty with short-term outcomes and organ support used by critically ill patients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospective collected data from 93 ICUs in Brazil from 2014 to 2015. We assessed frailty using the modified frailty index (MFI). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were discharge home without need for nursing care, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and utilization of ICU organ support and transfusion. We used mixed logistic regression and competing risk models accounting for relevant confounders in outcome analyses. Results: The analysis consisted of 129,680 eligible patients. There were 40,779 (31.4%) non-frail (MFI = 0), 64,407 (49.7%) pre-frail (MFI = 1–2) and 24,494 (18.9%) frail (MFI ≥ 3) patients. After adjusted analysis, frailty was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.89–3.08), particularly in patients admitted with lower SOFA scores. Frail patients were less likely to be discharged home (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.54–0.79) and had higher hospital and ICU LOS than non-frail patients. Use of all forms of organ support (mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, dialysis and transfusions) were more common in frail patients and increased as MFI increased. Conclusions: Frailty, as assessed by MFI, was associated with several patient-centered endpoints including not only survival, but also ICU LOS and organ support.

N2  - In the case of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), physicians are facing more and more difficulties in managing VTE and their treatment in frail patients. These patients could present several risk situations such as: chronic kidney disease (CKD), underweight or malnourished, falls, cognitive impairment, multi-medicated patients, cancer and pregnancy. Guidelines typically recommend anticoagulation. There are multiple challenges in the safe use of anticoagulation in frail patients, including bleeding risk, monitoring and adherence, and polypharmacy. The objective of this review is to explore these at-risk situations and to suggest adequate anticoagulation therapy, when possible, in each of these complex situations.

N2  - The initiation of dialysis is often not reasonable in very old patients with high comorbidities. This is especially true for patients who are geriatrically described as frail and show cognitive and executive function deficits. For estimation of the impairments, scores and standardized tests are more suitable than clinical experience or the surprise question. During the clarification for geriatric patients about the imminent need for dialysis, in addition to the options of various dialysis procedures the option of conservative treatment should also be discussed. In no way should all geriatric patients be given false hopes and the prospect that after beginning dialysis the health-related problems will be drastically improved. This is only the case with very few patients. Often only a stabilization of the condition can be achieved. In the case of conservative treatment an intensive orientation to the symptoms is more important than treatment to avoid delayed sequelae of dialysis. Inclusion in the palliative medicine network seems to be advisable. Initiation of dialysis treatment should be carried out by onset of uremia or other complications. A premature initiation of dialysis treatment is not meaningful in geriatric patients; however, there seems to be no doubt that dialysis in relatively healthy geriatric patients increases the survival rate. Focusing on symptom control and quality of life should be given priority in geriatric patients. A rehabilitation treatment before or after starting dialysis can possibly contribute to stabilization.

N2  - Background: Patients with cerebral infarction often suffer from frailty syndrome, which accelerates the decline of body function and seriously affects the quality of life of patients. We investigated the frailty-related serum markers in elderly patients with cerebral infarction in order to determine their diagnostic value for frailty. Methods: A hundred and fourteen inpatients aged 65 years and over were continuously recruited from department of geriatrics. Participants were assigned into a frailty group and a non-frailty group according to the Fried Frailty Criteria. The frailty group was further divided into mild, moderate, and severe feeble groups according to the clinical frailty scales. We analyzed the differences in serum indexes, the prevalence and incidence of chronic complications and geriatric syndrome between the frailty group and non-frailty group. The ROC curves of frailty-related serum indexes were drawn and the optimal cut-off points were determined. Finally, the area under ROC curves were calculated and compared. Results: A total of 114 elderly patients with cerebral infarction were divided into a frailty group (78/114, 68.4%) and a non-frailty group (36/114, 31.6%). Seventy-eight patients (68.4%) in the frailty group had senile cerebral infarction. The prevalence of cerebral infarction combined with hypertension (88.5%), angina (53.8%), myocardial infarction (32.1%), heart failure (34.6%), chronic renal disease (28.2%), and malignant tumor (24.4%) was significantly higher in the frailty group than in the non-frailty group (69.4%, 27.8%, 8.3%, 13.9%, 11.1%, and 8.3%, respectively; χ2 = 6.158, 6.747, 7.478, 5.241, 4.088, 4.062; all P < .05). The incidences of malnutrition and falling were significantly higher in the frailty group [28.2% (22/78) and 29.5% (23/78) respectively] than in the non-frailty group [0% (0/36) and 2.8% (1/36), χ2 = 12.582, 10.572; all P < .05). Comparing the frailty with the non-frailty group, the lower serum levels were found in HGB [(115.1 ± 19.7) g/L vs (135.8 ± 11.7) g/L], in LDL-C [(2.5 ± 0.9) mmol/L vs (3.1 ± 0.7) mmol/L] and in ALB [(35.3 ± 4.3) g/L vs (37.9 ± 2.3) g/L], [t = -4.918, -2.536, -3.036; P < .05], while the higher serum levels were found in hs-CRP [(10.8 ± 14.3) mg/L vs (3.1 ± 2.9)mg/L], in D-Dimer [(494.2 ± 412.9) μg/L, vs (256.4 ± 221.5) μg/ L], and in BNP [(458.0 ± 324.4) ng/mL vs (88.3 ± 68.4) ng/mL], (t = 3.266, 2.735, 6.838; all P < .05). Furthermore, the area under ROC curves of HGB, LDL-C and BNP were more than 0.75. Conclusions: Serological markers related to frailty in elderly patients with cerebral infarction are HGB, LDL-C, ALB, hs-CRP, D-Dimer, and BNP, among which the diagnostic values of HGB, LDL-C and BNP are higher.

N2  - Background and objectives Withdrawal from maintenance hemodialysis before death has become more common because of high disease and treatment burden. The study objective was to identify patient factors and examine the terminal course associated with hemodialysis withdrawal, and assess patterns of palliative care involvement before death among patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We designed an observational cohort study of adult patients on incident hemodialysis in a midwestern United States tertiary center, from January 2001 to November 2013, with death events through to November 2015. Logistic regression models evaluated associations between patient characteristics and withdrawal status and palliative care service utilization. Results Among 1226 patients, 536 died and 262 (49% of 536) withdrew. A random sample (10%; 52 out of 536) review of Death Notification Forms revealed 73% sensitivity for withdrawal. Risk factors for withdrawal before death included older age, white race, palliative care consultation within 6 months, hospitalization within 30 days, cerebrovascular disease, and no coronary artery disease. Most withdrawal decisions were made by patients (60%) or a family member (33%; surrogates). The majority withdrew either because of acute medical complications (51%) or failure to thrive/ frailty (22%). After withdrawal, median time to death was 7 days (interquartile range, 4-11). In hospital deaths were less common in the withdrawal group (34% versus 46% non withdrawal, P=0.003). A third (34%; 90 out of 262) of those that withdrew received palliative care services. Palliative care consultation in the withdrawal group was associated with longer hemodialysis duration (odds ratio, 1.19 per year; 95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.3; P<0.001), hospitalization within 30 days of death (odds ratio, 5.78; 95% confidence interval, 2.62 to 12.73; P<0.001), and death in hospital (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 3.27; P=0.02). Conclusions In this single-center study, the rate of hemodialysis withdrawals were twice the frequency previously described. Acute medical complications and frailty appeared to be driving factors. However, palliative care services were used in only a minority of patients.

N2  - Background and aims: Cognitive and renal impairment are pervasive among elderly frails, a high-risk, geriatric sub-population with peculiar clinical characteristics. In a series of frail individuals with non-advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), we aimed at assessing the entity of functional, general health and cognitive impairment and the possible relationship between these types of dysfunction and the severity of renal impairment. Methods: 2229 geriatric subjects were screened for frailty and CKD. Severity of CKD was assessed by eGFR (CKD-EPI formula). Frailty was established by the Fried Index. Functional, general health and cognitive status were assessed by validated score measures. Results: Final analysis included 271 frail CKD subjects (162 women, 109 men). Mean eGFR was 64.25 ± 25.04 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD (stage 3–4) was 44%. Twenty-six percent of patients had severe cognitive impairment, while mild and moderate impairment was found in 7 and 67% of individuals, respectively. All subjects had poor functional and general health status. Cognitive capacities significantly decreased across CKD stages (p for trend < 0.0001). In fully adjusted multivariate analyses, cognitive status remained an independent predictor of eGFR (β = 0.465; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Mild-to-moderate CKD is highly pervasive among frail elderly individuals and the severity of renal dysfunction is independently correlated with that of cognitive impairment. Future studies are advocated to clarify whether the combination of kidney and mental dysfunction may portend a higher risk of worsen outcomes in this high-risk population.

N2  - Background: Estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness using an unvaccinated comparison group generally results in biased effect estimates with exaggerated beneficial associations. Objectives: To quantify the reduction of bias when using an active comparator rather than an unvaccinated comparator to estimate preinfluenza season mortality among patients receiving chronic hemodialysis. Methods: Using data from Medicare's end-stage renal disease program (2009-2013), we compared the risk of all-cause mortality among adult recipients of high-dose vaccine (HDV) versus standard-dose vaccine (SDV), HDV versus none, and SDV versus none. We required continuous hemodialysis from May 1 to Jul 31 and ascertained insurance status and patient characteristics from Feb 1 to Jul 31. Follow-up began on Aug 1 and ended at the earliest of all-cause mortality, receipt of second influenza vaccine or unknown influenza vaccine type, modality switch, end of Medicare as primary payer, or start of influenza season. To quantify confounding bias, analyses were restricted to the preinfluenza season, when protective effects of vaccination should not yet be observed. We estimated standardized mortality ratio-weighted cumulative incidence functions using Kaplan-Meier methods and calculated risk differences (RD) and risk ratios (RRs) between groups. Results: Of 350 921 eligible patients contributing 825 642 unique patient preinfluenza seasons, 0.8% received HDV, 70.5% received SDV, and 28.7% remained unvaccinated. Compared with unvaccinated patients, HDV recipients (RR, 0.60 95% CI, 0.51-0.70) and SDV recipients (RR, 0.72 95% CI, 0.70-0.75) demonstrated a decreased risk of mortality during the preinfluenza period. The effect estimate was attenuated in the comparison of HDV versus SDV recipients (RR, 0.89 95% CI, 0.77-1.03). RD estimates were similar. Conclusions: Using an active comparator yielded less biased results than an unvaccinated comparator, as indicated by attenuated protective effect estimates of the association between influenza vaccination and all-cause mortality prior to influenza season. Future vaccine-effectiveness and safety studies should consider the active comparator design to reduce bias due to differences in underlying health status between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.

N2  - Background: We used multicenter international data from the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation Mechanically Assisted Circulation Support (IMACS) registry to determine bloodstream infection (BSI) event rate, independent risk factors, and association with mortality. Methods: Included were patients registered in IMACS from January 2013 through December 2015, assessed BSI event rate of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) and non–MCS-related BSIs, and conducted univariate and multivariate analyses between BSI with baseline characteristics and mortality. Results: We documented 1,606 BSIs in 1,231 of 10,171 MCS recipients (12%), with an event rate of 2.43 BSIs/100 patient-months within 3 months after implant (early onset) and 1.03 BSIs/100 patient-months after 3 months (late onset). Of these episodes, 1,378 (85.8%) were non– MCS-related BSI. Increasing body mass index and bilirubin were independent correlates of MCS-related BSI. Independent correlates of non–MCS-related BSI included older age, higher body mass index, previous cardiac surgery, baseline chronic renal disease and dialysis, pre-implant frailty, presence of biventricular assist device, total artificial heart or right ventricular assist device, and Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support category 1. Survival after 3 months after implant of patients who developed early-onset BSI was 56.9% at 24 months vs 77.4% in patients without early-onset BSI (p < 0.001). Early-onset BSI was an independent correlate of mortality at 3 months after implantation (hazard ratio, 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.09-3.15; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Early-onset BSI was associated with significantly increased 24-month mortality. More than 85% of these BSIs were not device related. There is an opportunity for infection prevention practices to decrease the BSI event rate, which may affect 24-month survival. These data can also serve as benchmarking for individual institutions.

N2  - Background: Among community-dwelling older adults, frailty is associated with heightened inflammation and subsequent mortality. Although frailty is common among patients on the KTwaitlist, the role of frailty and inflammation in this population remains unclear. We quantified the association between frailty, inflammation, and mortality in ESRD patients on the KT waitlist, and tested whether frailty and/or inflammation improves risk prediction beyond clinical factors available in registry-based models. Methods: We studied 1,975 prevalent ESRD patients on the KTwaitlist (11/ 1/09-2/28/17) in a multi-center cohort study of measured frailty in patients undergoing transplant evaluation; serum inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 [IL-6], soluble tumor necrosis factor-a receptor-1 [sTNFR1], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were analyzed in 605 of these participants. We compared the C-statistic of an established registry-based predictionmodel adding frailty and/or inflammation (1SD change in log IL-6, sTNFR1, CRP, or an aggregate inflammatory index). Results: The mean age was 53.7 and 18.4%were frail. Frail candidates had elevated serum IL-6 (P<0.001), sTNFR1 (P=0.02), CRP (P=0.01), and a higher inflammatory index (P<0.001). The registry-based model had moderate predictive ability (C-statistic=0.655). Frailty was associated with increased waitlist mortality risk (frail HR=2.19, 95%CI:1.26-3.79) (Figure) but did not improve mortality risk prediction (C-statistic=0.646; P=0.65) (Table). Like frailty, IL-6 (HR=2.13, 95%CI:1.41-3.22), sTNFR1 (HR=1.70, 95%CI:1.12-2.59), CRP (HR=1.68, 95%CI:1.06-2.67), and the inflammatory index (HR=2.09, 95%CI:1.38-3.16) were all associated with increased waitlist mortality risk. But unlike frailty, adding IL-6 (C-statistic=0.777; P=0.02), CRP (Cstatistic= 0.728; P=0.02), or the inflammatory index (C-statistic=0.777; P=0.02) substantially improved mortality risk prediction. Conclusions: Among adult ESRD patients on the KTwaitlist, frailty and inflammation were associated with increased waitlist mortality risk, but only inflammatory markers significantly improved mortality risk prediction. Heightened inflammation may be the biological link between frailty and mortality in KT candidates. (Figure Presented) .

N2  - Frailty is a clinical phenotype of decreased physiologic reserve to stressors and is associated with a pro-inflammatory state. Fried frailty (measured by 5 components: slowed walk speed, unintentional weight loss, decreased grip strength, low physical activity, and exhaustion) was developed and validated in community dwelling older adults and is associated with poor outcomes after kidney transplant (KT) including mortality, longer length of stay after KT, early hospital readmission, and delayed graft function. However, Fried frailty does not directly capture inflammatory biomarkers like interleukin 6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) that are associated with increased post-KT mortality. Therefore, we sought to identify a novel frailty index that combines inflammatory biomarkers and measured physical components. Methods: We identified 378 KT recipients at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 2009-2013 who consented to enrollment in a prospective cohort. Fried frailty and inflammatory markers (IL6, TNFalpha, highly sensitive C reactive protein [(HSCRP]) were collected at the time of admission for KT. We evaluated novel inflammatory-frailty indices combining Fried frailty phenotype (comprised of 5 components) plus the addition of individual inflammatory biomarkers (highest tertile of IL6, TNFalpha, HSCRP, or inflammatory index, separately) as a 6th component. Therefore, scores for each novel inflammatory frailty index were 0-6 points, and the presence of ≥3 components was considered frail. We used Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards model to assess mortality risk after KT by inflammatory frailty index. We adjusted Cox models for recipient age, sex, race, Charlson comorbidity index, and donor type. Results: Five-year survival for patients with and without each novel inflammatory frailty index for frail vs nonfrail was: 81% vs 93% (IL6-frailty), 87% vs 89% (HSCRP-frailty), 83% vs 91% (TNFalpha-frailty), and 83% vs 91% (Inflammatory index-frailty). After adjustment, mortality was 2.04-fold higher for IL6-frail recipients compared to non-IL6-frail (95%CI:1.02-4.10, p=0.05); there were no associations between the mortality and the other inflammatory-frailty indices (HSCRP-frail:1.01,95%CI:0.51-0.98,p=0.9; TNFalpha-frail:1.94,95%CI:0.98- 3.83,p=0.06; or inflammatory index-frail:1.66,95%CI:0.84-3.30,p=0.14) recipients. After adjustment, mortality was similar between nonfrail and frail KTrecipientsmeasured with Fried frailty (1.63,95%CI:0.75-3.51, p=0.2) and the highest tertile of IL-6 (1.37,95%CI:0.68-2.73, p=0.4). Conclusions: IL-6 frailty is a unique frailty phenotype, combining biomarkers and physical components that improves upon the Fried frailty phenotype and is more strongly associated with post-KT mortality. Measurement of biomarkers at KT evaluation and transplantation can guide risk assessment and patient counseling. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years. Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically, overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

N2  - Aim: Primary central nervous system post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PCNS-PTLD) is a rare complication of immunosuppresion.Data is limited to case series, with median survival of 47 months reported in the literature. We aimed to identify our cases of PCNS-PTLD and describe clinical and pathological features and outcomes. Methods: Search of Unit database and Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry plus review of case records. We included recipients transplanted between 1990 and 2016 who were followed at our unit. Results: Ten patients with PCNS-PTLD and no evidence of systemic PTLD were identified and examined. Median age was 52 (range 31-79). Median time to diagnosis after transplant was 13 years (range 1-36). Pathology from cerebral biopsy showed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive large B cell lymphoma in all patients. Follow-up was complete for all but one patient (lost to followup since 2011). Of these, four died: one was palliated after diagnosis of PCNS-PTLD due to multiple comorbidities. Another withdrew treatment three years after diagnosis aged 82 due to frailty. A third nursing-home patient died three years following PTLD fromaspiration pneumonia. The forth patient withdrew dialysis after a prolonged admission from presumed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 16 years post PTLD. Three patients remained in remission at time of death.All six surviving patients remain in remission and four retain graft function with a median eGFR of 54ml/min/1.73m2 (range 51-63). Two patients incurred graft loss, one at the time of PTLD diagnosis and the second at twelve months caused by chronic allograft nephropathy, however the second was re-transplanted 7 years after curative therapy. Treatment varied between patients and included surgical resection of single lesions, rituximab with systemic and/or intrathecal chemotherapy, localized or whole brain radiotherapy and reduction of immunosuppression. Conclusions: Over half PCNS-PTLD cases remain in remission, most of whom have ongoing graft function. Younger patients with less co-morbidity had better survival. Our data suggests that patients can maintain long-term remission and survive without loss of their renal graft. Long term follow-up of this cohort and others are needed to establishmore accurate survival rates.

N2  - Background Frail kidney transplant (KT) recipients may be particularly vulnerable to surgical stressors, resulting in delirium and subsequent adverse outcomes. We sought to identify the incidence, risk factors, and sequelae of post-KT delirium. Methods We studied 125,304 adult KT recipients (1999–2014) to estimate delirium incidence in national registry claims. Additionally, we used a validated chart abstraction algorithm to identify post-KT delirium in 893 adult recipients (2009–2017) from a cohort study of frailty. Delirium sequelae were identified using adjusted logistic regression (length of stay $2 weeks and institutional discharge [skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility]) and adjusted Cox regression (death-censored graft loss and mortality). Results Only 0.8% of KT recipients had a delirium claim. In the cohort study, delirium incidence increased with age (18–49 years old: 2.0%; 50–64 years old: 4.6%; 65–75 years old: 9.2%; and $75 years old: 13.8%) and frailty (9.0% versus 3.9%); 20.0% of frail recipients aged $75 years old experienced delirium. Frailty was independently associated with delirium (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 4.13; P=0.04), but premorbid global cognitive function was not. Recipients with delirium had increased risks of $2-week length of stay (OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 2.76 to 10.66; P,0.001), institutional discharge (OR, 22.41; 95% CI, 7.85 to 63.98; P,0.001), graft loss (hazard ratio [HR], 2.73; 95% CI, 1.14 to 6.53; P=0.03), and mortality (HR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.76 to 5.54; P,0.001). Conclusions Post-KT delirium is a strong risk factor for subsequent adverse outcomes, yet it is a clinical entity that is often missed.

N2  - Background: Among older adults, frailty is associated with heightened inflammation and subsequent mortality. Although frailty is common among patients on the KT waitlist, the role of frailty and inflammation in this population remains unclear. We quantified the association between frailty, inflammation, and waitlist mortality and tested whether frailty and/or inflammation improves risk prediction beyond registry-based factors. Methods: We studied 1,975 prevalent ESRD patients on the KT waitlist (11/1/09-2/28/17) in a multi-center cohort study of patients undergoing KT evaluation; serum inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 [IL-6], soluble tumor necrosis factor-a receptor-1 [sTNFR1], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were analyzed in 605 of these participants. We compared the C-statistic of an established registry-based prediction model adding frailty and/or inflammation (1SD change in log IL-6, sTNFR1, CRP, or an aggregate inflammatory index). Results: The mean age was 53.7 and 18.4% were frail. Frail candidates had elevated serum IL-6 (P<0.001), sTNFR1 (P=0.02), CRP (P=0.01), and a higher inflammatory index (P<0.001). The registry-based model had moderate predictive ability (C-statistic=0.655). Frailty was associated with increased mortality risk (frail HR=2.19, 95%CI:1.26-3.79) but did not improve mortality risk prediction (C-statistic=0.646; P=0.65). Like frailty, IL-6 (HR=2.13, 95%CI:1.41-3.22), sTNFR1 (HR=1.70, 95%CI:1.12-2.59), CRP (HR=1.68, 95%CI:1.06-2.67), and the inflammatory index (HR=2.09, 95%CI:1.38-3.16) were all associated with increased mortality risk. But unlike frailty, adding IL-6 (C-statistic=0.777; P=0.02), CRP (C-statistic=0.728; P=0.02), or the inflammatory index (C-statistic=0.777; P=0.02) substantially improved mortality risk prediction. Conclusions: Among patients on the KT waitlist, frailty and inflammation were associated with increased waitlist mortality risk, but only inflammatory markers significantly improved risk prediction. Heightened inflammation may be the biological link between frailty and mortality in KT candidates.

N2  - Background: Elevated troponin T at transplant evaluation has been reported to confer risk of cardiovascular mortality among renal transplants. We use troponin T along with assessment of cardiac function by ejection fraction (EF) on echocardiogram and 6 minute walk test distance (6MWT) and handgrip strength (HGS) as measures of physical performance and strength respectively in pre-transplant evaluation. Research Question: We examined the strength and significance of associations between between pre-transplant troponin T and 6MWT, HGS, age, and resting EF among patients being evaluated for renal transplant. Methods: A convenience sample of patients undergoing evaluation for renal transplant at a single center in the intermountain west between 2015 and 2017 was used. Of 575 patients screened for transplant during this time, 119 patients had undergone all tests of interest including troponin T, 6MWT, HGS, and resting EF. Patients without results available for all tests were excluded from analysis. Results: Of the 119 patients, the mean age was 54.9 years, 52% were male, 83% were white, and 38% had diabetic nephropathy as a cause of ESRD. There was no correlation between troponin T and age (R2 = 0.000, p = 0.870) or troponin T and HGS (R2 = 0.004, p = 0.473). There was a statistically significant but weak inverse correlation between troponin T and ejection fraction (R2 = 0.127, p < 0.001) and troponin T and 6MWT (R2= 0.071, p = 0.003). The average troponin T for diabetic patients was 0.08 and for non-diabetic patients was 0.02 (p=0.03). Troponin T values were not used in isolation to determine candidature for transplantation and were not associated with waitlist mortality or post transplant mortality during the study period. Conclusions: 1) Troponin T values track with diabetes, ejection fraction and 6MWT but not with age or HGS 2) The clinical significance of these correlations demands further study 3) The place of Troponin T when used in combination with measures of physical frailty for comprehensive evaluation of renal transplant candidates needs further study to determine utility.

N2  - Frailty is a phenotype of decreased physiologic reserve and is associated with a pro-inflammatory state. Fried frailty (slow walk speed, weight loss, decreased grip, low activity, exhaustion) is associated with poor outcomes after kidney transplant (KT). However, Fried frailty does not directly capture inflammatory biomarkers, like IL6 and TNF-alpha, that are associated with increased post-KT mortality. We sought to identify a novel frailty index combining inflammatory markers and physical components. METHODS: Fried frailty and inflammatory markers were collected for 378 KT recipients at Johns Hopkins Hospital upon KT admission enrolled in a prospective cohort (2009-2013). We evaluated novel inflammatory-frailty indices combining Fried frailty plus individual biomarkers (highest tertile of IL6, TNFa, HSCRP, inflammatory index). Scores for each novel index were 0-6, and ≥3 components was considered frail. We used Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards to assess mortality risk after KT. RESULTS: 5-year survival for frail vs nonfrail patients: 81 vs 93% (IL6-frail), 87 vs 89% (HSCRP-frail), 83 vs 91% (TNFa-frail), 83 vs 91% (Inflamm index-frailty). After adjustment, mortality was 2.04-fold higher for IL6-frail recipients compared to nonIL6-frail (95%CI:1.02-4.10, p=0.05); there were no associations between mortality and other inflammatory-frailty indices. After adjustment, mortality was similar between nonfrail and frail KT recipients measured with Fried frailty (1.63,95%CI:0.75-3.51) and highest tertile of IL-6 (1.37,95%CI:0.68-2.73). CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 frailty is a unique frailty phenotype, combining biomarkers and physical components that improves upon Fried frailty phenotype and is more strongly associated with post-KT mortality than either individual component. Measurement of biomarkers at KT evaluation and transplantation can guide risk assessment and patient counseling.

N2  - Background: Frailty is predictive of postoperative morbidity, including infections in older surgical patients. It is not known if frailty is associated with postoperative infections in patients undergoing renal transplantation. This study attempts to answer this question. Methods: We performed a retrospective, observational cohort study of older patients (age ≥65) who underwent primary renal transplant (RT) in a single transplant center from January 1, 2013 to April 1, 2017. The modified frailty index (mFI) was calculated based on 11 risk factors. The mFI scores were categorized as follows: 0-1 (fit), 2 (mildly frail) and ≥ 3 (moderately-severely frail). Outcomes measured were: 30-day mortality, 30-day post-transplant infection (PTI), 30-day readmission, and 200-day PTI. The association of frailty with RT outcomes was determined using multivariate logistic regression adjusting for confounders. Results: Eighty-three RT recipients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 60 (72%) were men and mean age was 70 years (± 3.93). The mean time on dialysis was 4.5 years (± 2.9). The distribution of mFI scores was as follows: 0-1 (37%), 2 (25%), and ≥ 3 (37%). No patients died within 30-day of RT. Rates of 30-day PTI and readmission were 14% and 30%, respectively. Infection within 200 days of RT occurred in 45%. Patients with mFI score of ≥3 had a higher risk of 30-day PTI (OR=12.70, p=0.029) when compared with mFI score of 0-1. Both mFI scores of 2 and ≥3 were associated with increased risk of infections within 200 days of RT (OR=5.00 and 5.28, respectively, p<0.05). The risk for 30-day readmission was higher among those with mFI scores of 2 and ≥ 3 (OR= 5.66 and 5.18, respectively, p< 0.05) compared with mFI score of 0-1. Conclusion: Our study shows that frail older RT recipients are at an increased risk for early PTI. Future studies utilizing larger databases are needed to validate our findings. Strategies that improve frailty status of older RT candidates should be evaluated for their impact on the rate of PTI.

N2  - Background/Aims: Frailty and depression both contribute to malnutrition and adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, their interaction is incompletely defined. Methods: We studied 178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed by a validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by the Geriatric Depression Scale; nutritional status was determined by subjective global assessment (SGA) and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS). All patients were followed for up to 24 months for survival and hospitalization analysis. Results: There were 111 patients (62.4%) physically frail, amongst those 48 (43.2%) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without frailty. There was an additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty on nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin decreased in a stepwise manner (35.8 ± 5.6, 34.9 ± 4.4, and 32.9 ± 5.3 g/L, respectively, p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 ± 0.61, 5.41 ± 0.59, and 5.04 ± 0.77, respectively (p< 0.0001), and MIS was 5.12 ± 2.30, 7.13 ± 3.22, and 9.48 ± 3.97, respectively (p< 0.0001). At 24 months, patient survival was 86.6%, 71.4%, and 62.5% for patients with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, respective (p=0.001). The median number of hospital stay was 8.04 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.91 - 19.42), 14.05 (IQR 3.57 - 37.27), and 26.62 (IQR 10.65 - 61.18) days per year of follow up, respectively (p< 0.0001). Conclusion: Physical frailty and depressive symptoms are both common in Chinese PD patients, and they have additive adverse effect on the nutritional status and clinical outcome.

N2  - Inflammation is associated with poor physical performance, frailty, disability and death in community-dwelling older adults. Given the elevated inflammation levels among ESRD patients, it is likely that inflammatory markers are associated with adverse outcomes such as frailty or physical limitation among kidney transplantation (KT) candidates, although the strength of these associations is unclear. Methods: 974 participants were enrolled at the time of evaluation for KT (4/2014 to 5/2017). Inflammatory markers, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and frailty were assessed at the time of KT evaluation. Participants with a SPPB score <10 were classified as SPPB impaired. Elevated inflammation markers were defined as >1SD higher level of IL-6, sTNFR1, CRP or an inflammation index in log scale. Results: Dialysis groups had higher inflammation; HD patients were most likely to be SPPB impaired and frail (Table 1). Overall, the odds of being frail or SPPB impaired at the time of KT evaluation were higher with increasing IL-6, CRP, and inflammation index, while the odds of being SPPB impaired were also higher with increasing sTNFR1 (Table 2). Among HD patients, the odds of being frail at the time of KT evaluation were higher with increasing IL-6 and CRP and the odds of being SPPB impaired were higher with increasing IL-6, CRP, and inflammation index (Table 2). Conclusion: Among KT candidates, those undergoing HD have higher odds of being frail and SPPB impaired with elevated levels of inflammatory markers. HD patients with elevated inflammatory markers, especially IL-6, CRP, and inflammation index, may need special care such as closer follow up or prehabilitation to improve lower extremity function and reduce frailty burden while they are on the waitlist.

N2  - Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, increases the risk of delayed graft function, longer length of stay, early hospital readmission, immunosuppression intolerance, and mortality among kidney transplant (KT) recipients. Despite its clinical importance in predicting KT outcomes, there are no national estimates of the prevalence or geographic distribution of frailty among US KT recipients. METHODS: Frailty (Fried phenotype) was prospectively measured in 1,065 KT recipients (12/2008-12/2016) in our multi-center cohort. Using SRTR data on 126,376 KT recipients, we projected the prevalence of frailty and intermediate frailty using predictive mean matching to multiply impute frailty scores, accounting for recipient, donor, transplant, and post-transplant factors. RESULTS: In our multi-center cohort, the prevalence of frailty and intermediate frailty were 18.4% and 30.0%, respectively, among deceased-donor KT (DDKT) recipients and 14.5% and 28.1%, respectively, among living-donor KT (LDKT) recipients. Projected nationally, the prevalence of frailty and intermediate frailty were 18.0% (95% CI: 14.7-21.3%) and 29.9% (95% CI: 27.5-32.2%), respectively, among DDKT recipients and 12.5% (95% CI: 10.8-14.3%) and 28.4% (95% CI: 23.8-33.0%), respectively, among LDKT recipients. Frailty prevalence varied by geography (p<0.001) (Figures 1 and 2). CONCLUSION: We project that nearly 20% of KTs 2000-2016 were performed with frail recipients; however, these recipients and their providers were likely not aware of their higher risk for adverse post-KT outcomes. Given its prevalence, transplant programs should consider assessing frailty during KT evaluation to improve informed consent and identify candidates for pre-KT interventions.

N2  - Background: Frailty is a clinical phenotype of decreased physiologic reserve and resistance to stressors. Given the potential utility of frailty evaluation as prognosticator of kidney transplant (KT) outcomes, we sought to understand how frailty is being measured and used in clinical practice, through a survey of US KT centers. Methods: Survey about practices related to frailty were distributed electronically to members of the AST Kidney/Pancreas Community of Practice (Nov. 2017) and of the 204 adult centers, 33 responded to date (16%) with an expected response >70% by early 2018. Results: Frailty is commonly measured as part of KT candidacy evaluation (Fig. 1). Frailty assessments were most often performed by a nurse (29%) or doctor (24%). The most commonly used metric was functional status (Fig.2); 63% reported performing >1 assessment. The protocol for frailty assessments varied. 19% performed these assessments only for older patients. The most common use of frailty assessments was to determine transplant candidacy (81%). When a patient was identified as being frail, respondents were less likely to list the patient (95%), and were more likely to tailor maintenance immunosuppression (52%), and to prescribe prehabilitation (52%). Conclusions: In a subsample of US KT centers, we found that frailty is commonly assessed as part of KT evaluation and is used to make decision about transplant candidacy, yet there is variability in how and in whom frailty is measured across centers. Efforts to standardize the measurement and clinical practice may improve equitable access to KT and outcomes of KT recipients.

N2  - Objectives: There is no consensus on the best immunosuppressive regimen for elderly renal transplant recipients. The objective of this study was to assess cytomegalovirus infection incidence and kidney transplant outcomes in elderly recipients treated with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors sirolimus/tacrolimus at low doses compared with those receiving tacrolimus/mycophenolate sodium. Materials and Methods: In this single-center prospective randomized study (Trial Registration No. NCT02683291), kidney transplant recipients over 60 years of age were randomly allocated into 2 groups: tacrolimus-sirolimus (21 patients) and tacrolimus-mycophenolate (23 patients). Cytomegalovirus infection rate and patient survival, biopsy-proven acute rejection, and renal function at 12 months were assessed. Results: Cytomegalovirus infection rate was higher in the mycophenolate group (60.9%) than in the sirolimus group (16.7%; P=.004). The rates of biopsy-proven acute rejection, patient survival, graft survival, and estimated glomerular filtration rate over 12 months did not significantly differ between groups. Conclusions: The incidence of cytomegalovirus infection was significantly lower in the sirolimus group. The use of tacrolimus combined with sirolimus in elderly kidney transplant recipients is safe.

N2  - The present article provides an update on anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation in distinct clinical scenarios requiring particular considerations, such as ischaemic heart disease, electrical cardioversion, pulmonary vein ablation, the presence of valvular disease with or without prosthetic valves, and renal insufficiency, as well as old age and frailty. In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, the presence of renal insufficiency increases both thrombotic and haemorrhagic risk. In mild and moderate stages, direct-acting anticoagulants confer a greater benefit than warfarin, although they usually require dose adjustment. In renal failure/dialysis, there is no solid evidence that warfarin is beneficial and the use of direct-acting anticoagulants is not recommended. Because of its pathophysiology, oral anticoagulation could have a beneficial effect in patients with heart disease. However, vitamin K antagonists have not shown a satisfactory risk-benefit ratio. In contrast, direct-acting anticoagulants, at reduced doses, could have a beneficial effect in this scenario in association with antiplatelet agents. The use of direct-acting anticoagulants prior to electrical cardioversion in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation seems to be associated with a risk of cardioembolic events that is at least comparable to that of vitamin K antagonists. Their use avoids delay in the application of electrical cardioversion in patients without adequate INR levels. In the context of their use before and after atrial fibrillation ablation, dabiga-tran and rivaroxaban have demonstrated at least non-inferiority with vitamin K antagonists in terms of safety. In patients with any type or grade of valvular disease and atrial fibrillation, the indication of antithrombo-tic treatment must be evaluated in the same way as in patients with atrial fibrillation and no valvular di-sease. Whenever anticoagulation is required, direct-acting anticoagulants are the treatment of choice in nearly all situations, except in patients with mechanical valves or who have significant rheumatic mitral disease, who should be treated with vitamin K antagonists. The choice of appropriate antithrombotic stra-tegy in frail elderly patients is complex and involves multiple factors beyond assessment of embolic and haemorrhagic risk. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is essential for an individualised final decision. Moreover, any such decision should be consensus-based and periodically reviewed. Direct-acting anticoa-gulants could be the most beneficial alternative in most elderly patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

N2  - Background: High kidney donor profile index (KDPI >85%) organs can grant earlier access to transplantation particularly for those who are frail, have limited waiting time and/or unfavorable blood type. We sought to investigate the outcomes of high KDPI recipients at a center with high utilization rate. Methods: All adult deceased donor kidney transplant older recipients (age≥60) from a single center institution between Jan 2013 and May 2017 were analyzed. KTR were divided in two by KDPI, either low (≤85%) or high, and examined the outcomes by CKD stage at 6 months. Donor and recipient pre and post-transplant parameters were analyzed through a univariate manner. Survival analysis was done by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test were used for patient and graft survival. Multivariate Cox proportion hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Results: There were 42 low KDPI (mean KDPI 59±17%) and 24 high KDPI KTR (mean KDPI 93±4; p<0.01) with similar follow up (low KDPI 2.6±1.4 years vs high KDPI 2.4±1.1; p=0.52). Cohorts were well matched; age (low 66±5 years vs 66±5; p=0.52), mainly male (76% vs. 83%; p=0.74), similar DM (37% vs. 41%; p=0.84), and equivalent EPTS (76±17 vs. 69±17; p=0.12). High KDPI had shorter dialysis vintage (3.8±2.5 years vs 2.8±1.6; p=0.05), longer cold ischemia time (20±5hrs vs. 23±5; p=0.04). There was no significant difference in race, re-transplant, or BMI. 6-month eGFR in the high KDPI group was substantially lower (59±17 ml/min/m2 vs 44±16; p<0.01) with differences in CKD stage distribution (% CKD stage 2: Low 33% vs 5%) and (%CKD stage 3: Low 59% vs 81%; p=0.01). There were trends for lower estimated 4 year patient (low KDPI: 100% vs. high KDPI 92%; p=0.08) and 4 year graft survival (low: 95% vs high: 88%; p=0.1). Six month CKD stage did not impact graft survival (p=0.78). Neither 6 month GFR (HR: 0.97, CI: 0.91-1.04; p=0.41) nor KDPI (HR: 1.02, CI: 0.97-1.06; p=0.47) were predictive of graft survival after adjusting for dialysis vintage, gender, diabetes, BMI, DGF, and cold ischemia. Conclusions: Elderly kidney transplant candidates can be efficiently and timely transplanted using high KDPI organs without major compromise of their clinical outcomes. High KDPI organ utilization among this population should be further expanded.

N2  - Older kidney transplant recipients (KTR) face challenges of post-transplant complications related to frailty and comorbidities. They are particularly vulnerable to infectious complications. This study elucidates etiology of hospital admissions and outcomes in older KTR. Methods: Ten-year, retrospective, longitudinal, cohort study of 500 patients age ≥ 60, who had kidney transplantation from 2005-2015. Demographic data, transplant characteristics, and outcomes data were collected. Manual chart abstraction and adjudication to determine primary etiologies for hospitalization were conducted. Standard univariate statistics and multivariable Cox regression modeling were utilized for analysis. Results: Mean age of older KTR was 66 years (range 60-81). 59% were males and 50% were African Americans. 49% had CKD due to DM. 62% of older KTR had at least one hospitalization post-transplant. Significant predictors of hospitalization were DGF (HR=1.6 [CI 1.2-2.2]), DM (HR=1.3 [CI 1-1.7]), PRA (HR=1.3 [CI 1-1.7]), dialysis duration (HR=1.1 [CI 1-1.2]), p<0.05. Most common reasons for hospitalization were infection (95 admissions per 100 patient-yrs) and surgical complications (43 per 100 patient-yrs). Average length of stay was 6.4 days. Older KTR who had at least one hospitalization had 84% higher risk for graft loss (p=0.001) (Fig. 1), which varied substantially by hospitalization etiology. Specifically, hospitalizations due to rejection (HR=2.5 [CI 1.6-3.8]), opportunistic infections (HR=1.7 [CI 1.1-2.7]), or GI complications (HR=1.6 [CI 1.1-2.1]) were significant risk factors for graft loss, while those for other infections, cardiovascular events, diabetes, and AKI were not. Conclusion: Post-transplant hospitalization in older KTR is highly prevalent and often due to infection. The primary readmission etiologies associated with graft loss are rejection, opportunistic infections, and GI complications. Hospitalization in older KTR has significant impact on graft survival. Addressing comorbidities and risks in the pre-transplant and outpatient setting may help alleviate burden of hospitalization in older KTR and significantly improve graft outcomes.

N2  - Background: Alemtuzumab (alem), a monoclonal antibody against CD52, causes profound depletion of T and B cells and as well as monocytes, NK and dendritic cells. Its effect is long-lasting; B cells recover after 12 months and T cells recover after more than 36 months. It is indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and is used in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in several solid organ transplantations, including renal, as induction therapy for the prevention of early rejection. Autoimmune complications after alem therapy include autoimmune thyroid disorders (17-26%), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) (1-2%) and glomerulopathy (1%). In our experience at Hammersmith Hospital (HH) the incidence of ITP in alem-induced renal transplant patients (pts) is 1-2%. Aims: To report the outcome of pts developing ITP after alem-induced renal transplants. Methods:We retrospectively analyzed 31 pts attending the hematology clinic at HH, London, with ITP requiring treatment after an alem-induced renal transplant between 2002 and 2016. ITP was defined as a rapid onset of isolated thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100x109/L) with no other explanation. Pts with a platelet count <30x109/L or requiring a higher platelet count for other indications were treated. Response (R) was defined as platelet count >=30x109/L and at least doubling of baseline count. Complete response (CR) was defined as platelet count >=100x109/L. Results: 21 (67.7%) pts were males, median age at transplant was 38.5 years and median age at ITP diagnosis was 52 years. 42% were deceaseddonor transplants, 58% were living-donor transplants. All pts received tacrolimus as post-transplant immunosuppression, 6 (20%) in association with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Median time from renal transplant to ITP development was 33 months (range 1-161), median lowest platelet count was 5.5 x 109/L. 18 pts (58%) reported bleeding symptoms at diagnosis. One patient achieved spontaneous CR. Of the remaining 30 pts, 27 (90%) received steroids, IVIG or both as first-line treatment; 3 received additional therapy (IVIG+rituximab (rtx); IVIG+romiplostim (romi); rtx alone). The overall response (R) to first line therapy was 63% (53% achieving CR). After a median follow-up of 34 months (range 1-97), 11 pts (36.6%) are still in CR without further therapy. 19 pts required second line therapy, ten required 3 lines, five 4 lines, two 5 lines and one 6 lines. All eventually responded: 4 to IVIG +/- steroids; 7 to thrombopoietin receptoragonists (TPORA); 4 to rtx; 2 to MMF; 2 to combination therapy. 7 pts require ongoing treatment (TPORA/MMF). 16 pts (53%) experienced adverse events: 4 steroid-induced diabetes, 1 knee osteonecrosis, 3 thrombosis, 1 VZV encephalitis, 5 malignancies (3 PTLD and 2 solid tumors), 2 deaths from infectious complications (Table 1). Summary and Conclusions: ITP is a non-negligible complication in pts who received alem as induction therapy for renal transplant. Most pts responded to first-line therapy and long-term response rates (RR) were similar to those expected with primary ITP (36.6%). This is a particularly frail subset of pts due to their chronic immunosuppression, with an increased risk of infections and malignancies, and many pts have an increased thrombotic risk. Balancing risks and benefits of each treatment remains the biggest challenge: steroidsparing regimens should be preferred given the high toxicity in this cohort. TPORA and rtx had high RR and acceptable side effects, with risks of thrombosis or infection the primary factors driving the treatment choice. Further studies are needed to determine the best treatment pathway for these pts.

N2  - Older kidney transplant recipients are vulnerable to early graft loss likely due to frailty and burden of comorbidities. Other factors not inherent to the recipient may also contribute to early graft loss. The goal of this study was to conduct a detailed assessment of risk factors for early graft loss in elderly kidney transplant recipients. Methods: Retrospective longitudinal cohort study of 500 kidney transplant recipients age 3 60, from 2005-2015. Detailed baseline demographic and transplant characteristics were abstracted from medical records. Univariate statistics and multivariable logistic modeling were used for analysis. Results: 39 out of the 500 older kidney transplant recipients (7.8%) had graft loss within 1 year post-transplant. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table 1. Univariate analysis showed that HTN as etiology of CKD (OR=2.0 [0.9-4.8]), longer dialysis duration (OR=1.2 [1-1.4]), previous transplant (OR=6.2 [1.6-23.4]), higher KDPI (OR=3.3 [1-13]), DGF (OR=3.8 [1.7-8.7]), and acute rejection (OR=3.2 [1.4-7.3]) were significantly associated with early graft loss in older kidney transplant recipients. Multivariate analysis showed that higher KDPI (OR=6.5 [1.2-33]), DGF (OR=4.3 [1.8-10.4]), GFR variability (OR=1.05 [1.03-1.08], PRA (OR=1.02 [1-1.03]) predicted early graft loss. On the other hand, female recipient gender (OR=0.14 [0.04-0.45]) was a protective factor. The same factors seem to predict graft loss within 2 years post-transplant. The final logistic model had excellent discernibility in predicting those at risk for early graft loss (AUC 0.833) (Fig. 1). (Figure Presented) Conclusion: Several recipient and clinical characteristics significantly predict early graft loss in older kidney transplant recipients. Risk stratification of donors and recipients, judicious organ allocation, as well as close clinical monitoring of at-risk patients may help to preempt rapid GFR decline and early graft loss in older kidney transplant recipients. This study strongly suggests that a more rigorous selection and follow-up process especially for high risk older kidney transplant recipients may help improve graft outcomes in this group.

N2  - Older kidney transplant recipients face challenges of post-transplant complications related to frailty and comorbidity burden. They are particularly vulnerable to acute kidney injury (AKI) due to various etiologies. This study elucidates etiology of AKI and long-term outcomes in older kidney transplant recipients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 500 patients age ≥ 60, who underwent kidney transplantation from 2005-2015. AKI was defi ned as an acute increase in serum creatinine ≥ 25% from baseline levels. Demographic characteristics and transplant data were collected. Manual chart abstraction was conducted to determine etiologies of AKI and outcomes. Analyses of etiology of AKI and outcomes were conducted using univariate statistics and multivariable Cox regression modeling. Results: Mean age of older kidney transplant recipients was 66 years (range 60-81). 59% were males and 50% were African-American. 49% had CKD due to DM. 56% of older kidney transplant recipients had at least one AKI episode post-transplant. Significant risk factors for the development of AKI included DGF (HR=1.6 [CI 1.1-2.2]), older donor age (HR=1.02 [CI 1.01-1.02]), African American donor (HR=1.3 [CI 1-1.7]), and tacrolimus variability (HR=1.01 [CI 1-1.02]). The most common etiologies for AKI were infection (9 events per 100 patient-years), dehydration (7 per 100 patient-years), and GI complications (6 per 100 patient-years). Kidney transplant recipients who developed at least one AKI episode had a 2.6 fold higher risk for graft loss ([CI 1.7-3.8], p<0.001) (Figure 1). In particular, AKI events due to rejection, infection, dehydration, surgical complications, and cardiovascular events significantly correlated with graft loss (p<0.05). (Figure presented) Conclusion: Post-transplant AKI in older kidney transplant recipients is common and often due to infection and dehydration. These events are substantial risk factors for graft loss and thus dictate long-term graft outcomes. Addressing modifi able risk factors and alleviating comorbidities that contribute to AKI in older kidney transplant recipients may significantly improve long-term graft outcomes.

N2  - Older patients are more often being considered for kidney transplantation, however many candidates are on the waitlist for several years. We sought to evaluate the impact of frailty in the context of previously established transplant candidacy. Materials: The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is an established tool used to assess physical performance of the lower extremities with which metaanalysis has been linked to all-cause mortality when the score was <10 Methods: Waitlisted patients 65 and older were assessed using the SPPB and scores were compared to real time physician assessments. Clinical data including demographics, transplant type and comorbidities were collected. Statistical analysis performed using JMP Pro 12. Pearson chi-squared, T test as appropriate for categorical or numeric variables. Results: Out of 56 patients ages 65 to 76, older patients (70-76) had lower SPPB scores (mean 6) compared with patients 65-69 (mean 7.8). There was a trend towards more diabetes in the older group 67% vs. 49% (p=0.187). SPPB scores correlated well with physician assessments as most patients removed from the waitlist had an SPPB of ≤ 6. Of those with SPPB < 7, 32% died or were removed from the waitlist vs. 7% of those with SPPB ≥ 7 (p= 0.019) Diabetes was more prevalent among patients with SPPB < 7 (68%) vs patients with SPPB ≥ 7 (43%) but this finding did not reach statistical significance (p=0.060). In the older group the highest SBBP scores were observed in patients with a BMI of 26-30, followed by BMI > 30 and lowest scores in BMI of 19-25, in contrast to the younger group where the lowest scores were in the BMI >30 group. Table 1. Association of frailty with clinical characteristics SBBP < 7 SBBP ≥ 7 p- value Age ≥ 70 32.1 % 42.9% 0.408 Median BMI 27.6 26.7 0.308 DM 42.9% 67.9% 0.060 Died or delisted 32.1% 7.1% 0.019 Conclusion: There was an excellent correlation between SPPB scores and death and/or removal from the transplant waitlist which suggests frailty assessments can be used as an objective measure for candidate selection, risk stratification and prediction of outcomes. We will further expand on this study and attempt to validate our results using a larger number of patients with a broader age range, 55 years and older.

N2  - Introduction: Obese, type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients experience the greatest sepsis mortality secondary to developing acute kidney injury (AKI). Instead of recovering from AKI, this physiologically frail population progresses to acute kidney disease (AKD), chronic kidney disease, and finally renal failure/death. Ongoing inflammation and complement production are known to provoke AKI during sepsis. We hypothesize that sepsis induced renal inflammation and complement production drive the evolution from AKI to AKD in the obese, T2D population. Methods: 30 week old C57BL/6 (lean), Diet Induced Obese (DIO, diabetic), and C3, C6, TLR2, and TNF null mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLPLD20) or sham procedure. Daily weights and urine were collected. At serial time points, plasma and kidneys were harvested. Multiplex RT-PCR arrays were used to evaluate toll like receptors (TLR), complement, and immune signaling cascades. TNF, BUN, creatinine, and NGAL were evaluated by ELISA. Results: After sepsis from CLP, DIO mice lost more body weight compared to lean mice (P < 0.0001). The DIO weight loss was also associated with a notable decrease in urinary output. In septic lean mice, renal NGAL, a marker for AKI, peaked at 1 day and returned to baseline by day 7. In septic DIO mice, renal NGAL did not peak until day 14(P < 0.001), indicating a transition from AKI to AKD. Compared to sham, both lean and DIO mice had eight-fold higher renal C3 mRNA levels 1 day after sepsis (P < 0.001). In lean mice, renal C3 levels peaked on day 1 and returned to baseline by day 7, while renal C3 levels in DIO mice did not peak until day 14and then persisted. Renal in-situ hybridization showed significantly more C3 in septic DIO kidneys compared to lean. Kidney electron microscopy demonstrated persistent architectural changes representing ongoing injury in DIO mice 2 weeks after sepsis, compared to lean mice with no injury. Renal RT-PCR showed significantly more TLR2, TNF, and C3 mRNA in septic DIO mice compared to lean mice. C3, TLR2, and TNF null mice each produced less renal NGAL and C3, demonstrating less AKI (p < 0.001). C6 null mice also produced less renal NGAL, indicating the membrane attack complex partially contributes to AKI. In septic DIO mice, exogenous TNF inhibition blocked renal NGAL and C3 production, preventing AKI and the subsequent progression to AKD after sepsis. Conclusions: Lean mice resolve AKI by 7 days, while DIO mice progress from AKI to AKD. Local renal C3 production and the membrane attack complex potentiate AKI to AKD progression through TLR2 and TNF signaling. TNF inhibition blocks AKI development and the progression to AKD in DIO mice, representing a novel strategy to prevent ongoing renal injury, preserve renal function, and improve overall sepsis mortality.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The prevalence of elderly individuals is dramatically increasing worldwide, posing a challenge of sustainability for public health systems in view of the wealth of chronic diseases that associates with human senescence.Frail patients are high-risk elderly individuals showing particular characteristics that may include unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, low energy expenditure, slow gait speed and weak grip strength.Cognitive and renal impairment are pervasive among elderly frails. In a series of frail individuals with non-advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), we aimed at assessing the entity of functional, general health and cogni-tive impairment and the possible relationship between these types of dysfunction and the severity of renal impairment. Methods: 2229 geriatric subjects were screened for frailty and CKD. Severity of CKD was assessed by EGFR Z(CKD-EPI formula). Frailty was established by the Fried Index, Cognitive functions by the Mini Mental State Examination, functional status with activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), general health status by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) scoring system. Results: Final analysis included 271 frail CKD subjects (162 women, 109 men). Mean EGFR Zwas 64.25625.04 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD (stage 3-4) was 44%. Twenty-six percent of patients had severe cognitive impairment, while mild and moderate impairment was found in 7% and 67% of individuals, respectively. All subjects had poor functional and general health status. Cognitive capacities significantly decreased across CKD stages (p for trend <0.0001). In fully adjusted multivariate analyses, cognitive status remained an independent predictor of EGFR Z(b =0.465; P< 0.0001). Conclusions: Mild-to-moderate CKD is highly pervasive among frail elderly individuals and the severity of renal dysfunction is independently correlated with that of cognitive impairment. Our results are important if we consider that cognitive and renal function decline may contribute to the clinical vulnerability of older persons. CKD patients and older frail individuals with cognitive deterioration share an increased fre-quency and severity of symptoms such as tiring easily, weakness, lack of energy, difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps, and easy bruising, as well as psychologic distress. It has also been shown that cognitive impairment is also associated with decreased adherence to medications and, hence, could contribute to faster progression to end stage renal disease and to the need of chronic renal replacement therapyFuture studies are advocated to clarify whether the combination of kidney and mental dysfunction may portend a higher risk of worsen outcomes in this high-risk population.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Oral infections, mucosal lesions and impaired oral health are highly prevalent and frequently severe for adults treated with long-term hemodialysis. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of mucosal lesions and association with mortality outcomes among hemodialysis patients. Methods: Data were obtained from the ORAL-D study. The ORAL-D study was a multinational cohort study that involved a comprehensive, standardized oral and dental examination among 4726 patients with end-stage kidney disease treated with long term hemodialysis in 7 countries in Europe and South America. Oral mucosal lesions were ulceration, white stain, red stain, neoformation, petechial lesions, geographical tongue, scrotal tongue, thrush, and herpes, assessed by trained dentists according to standard WHO guidelines. The association between mucosal lesions and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was estimated using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables (country, age, sex, education, smoking history, prior myocardial infarction, diabetes, hemoglobin, serum albumin, serum phosphorus, time on dialysis and body mass index). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Results: Overall, 70 participants (1.7%) had mucosal ulceration, 147 (3.5%) participants had white stain, 169 (4%) had red stain, 85 (2%) had neoformation, and 331 (7.9%) had petechial lesions. 207 (4.9%) had geographical tongue and 450 (10.7%) had scrotal tongue. Thrush was observed in 192 participants (4.6%). Twenty-one participants had oral herpetic lesions. During a median 3.47 (1.55-5.78) months of follow-up, there were 2114 deaths including 1013 cardiovascular deaths. In unadjusted survival analyses, the proportion of patients who died was higher among those with red stain, scrotal tongue, and petechial lesions. Similarly, the estimated proportion of patients who had a cardiovascular death was higher among those with red stain, scrotal tongue, oral petechial lesions, neoformation, and oral thrush. When adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic factors, only the presence of oral thrush was significantly associated with an increased risk of all cause (adjusted HR 1.37, 95% CI 1-1.86) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.09-2.46). This association was confirmed in competing risks analysis and using a shared frailty model to account for clustering by country. Conclusions: There is generally limited evidence of an independent association between oral mucosal lesions and mortality outcomes among hemodialysis patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Both telomere length (TL) and frailty are associated with ageing. Telomere length is a biomarker of ageing that has been shown to play a role in post transplantation survival. Whilst frailty is a measure of physiological reserve, it also represents vulnerability that can lead to adverse health outcomes. Frailty is increasingly recognised as an important risk factor to prolonged hospital stay and early hospital readmissions post transplantation. However, telomere length and frailty associations post renal transplantation (RT) and immediate outcomes are less well known. The aim of the study was to assess the association of frailty and relative telomere length (rTL) with immediate outcomes after RT in our cohort. Methods: This was a single centre prospective cohort study from October 2016 to April 2017. Frailty was measured as defined by Fried et al based on 5 components at hospital admission for RT. Non-frail was defined as a score of 0 or 1; intermediate as a score of 2 and frail if the score was >=3. rTL was measured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells taken prior to the transplant using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). rTL was expressed as T/S ratio. Data on co-morbidities, complications, length of stay in hospital and readmissions within 3 months post-transplantation were recorded. Results: 33 recipients (14 male, 19 female) were recruited prior to RT. Age ranged from 26-77 years of age with a median age of 48. Cadaveric transplantation was performed in 66.7% of patients and 33.3% had living donor transplant. 66.7% of patients were non-frail (68.2% cadaveric, 63.6% living donor); 24.2% were intermediately frail (18.2% cadaveric, 36.4% living donor) and 9.1% were frail (13.6% cadaveric) at the time of RT. The length of stay post RT ranged between 6 to 24 days with a mean length of stay of 9.2 days. There was no correlation between age, frailty index, grip strength and rTL with length of stay post RT. A higher Charleston co-morbidity index was strongly associated with longer length of stay post RT (p=0.001). No mortalities were reported in our cohort during the follow up period. There was no significant association between raised frailty scores or rTL with increased hospital readmissions in the first 3 months post RT. Conclusions: Despite a strong association between raised frailty index with increased hospital readmissions and prolonged hospital stay seen in other forms of transplantation, our study failed to confirm this hypothesis in our cohort of patients who underwent RT. There was no significant association between frailty index and rTL with length of stay and outcomes 3 months post renal transplantation. However, a small sample size as well as shorter follow up period may be a limiting factor in this study, affecting the results.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: A thorough geriatric evaluation of elderly subjects affected by advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) can help to individualize their therapeutic and care program. However the overwhelming number of elderly patients attending the nephrology clinics does not allow all of them to undergo a complete geriatric evaluation. Therefore we need to validate a reliable tool that can help to identify those patients that will benefit the most from a complete clinical evaluation. Frailty is a clinical definition that identifies patients suffering from cumulative deficits in different domains, which give them a worse prognosis in terms of a greater risk of disability, institutionalization and mortality. In this study we evaluated whether the assessment of frailty can help to identify those patients that may benefit from a multi-disciplinary approach. Methods: We evaluated 129 prevalent CKD elderly patients attending our outpatient clinic, all subjects had a relatively stable renal function and were not on dialysis yet (age > 65 years, eGFR < 45 ml/min). We excluded patients not able to collaborate and those deemed to have a life expectancy <6 months. Frailty was defined in accordance with the impairment in three or more domains of the Fried's Frailty Phenotype scale (FFP). Comorbidity was classified according to Comulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS).Nutritional status was evaluated using three different multiple choice tests: International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), Malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS), Geriatric Nutrition Risk Index (GNRI), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Body composition was measured using a multifrequency bioelec-trical impedance analysis device (BIA). Physical performance was evaluated using Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB); handgrip strength. Cognitive/psychological evaluation has been determined using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test and the Geriatriac Depression Scale (GDS). Results: We examined 129 prevalent CKD elderly patients attending our outpatient clinic, 53% males, age 80 6 6 years. Overall 49% of patients were classified as frail. Frail (F-CKD) and not frail CKD patients (NF-CKD) showed the same burden of comorbidities (CIRS comorbidity: 6,161,6vs5,361,8;p=0,17; CIRS severity: 21,1 65,5 vs 19,1 65,2; p=0,20). However F-CKD had a higher prevalence of protein energy wasting syndrome (37 vs 15%, p=0,01), were more malnourished (MIS 8,1 65,3 vs4,662,4; p<0,001 and MNA 24 64 vs 26 62; p=0,0004) and had less lean tissue than NF-CKD subjects (lean tissue % 42,5 69 vs 52,4 610,9). F-CKD patients had also a worse overall physical performance than NF-CKD at SPPB (5.062.4vs9.361.7; p<0.0001). Finally, F-CKD had a more severe cognitive impairment (MMSE 25.7 63.4 vs 27.7 62.8; p=0.0015, Clock Drawing Test 2.6 6 1.9 vs 4.1 61.7 p <0.0001) as well as a greater depression-index: GDS 11.065.6vs7.1 65.8p=0.001. Conclusions: In our cohort the patients classified as frail according to Fried definition (i.e. F-CKD), were more frequently malnourished, sarcopenic and moreover they had a reduced overall physical and cognitive performance. Therefore we suggest that FFP may be a reliable tool to identify those elderly CKD patients that may benefit from thorough geriatric evaluation.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Gut microbiota (gMB) has been suggested to contribute to many inflammatory and metabolic disorders typical of the elderly, thus worsening their frailty. A series of alterations of gMB composition and functions have been described also in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Frailty characterizes many CKD elderly patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. The aim of our study was to assess gMB composition in CKD elderly patients compared to a group of elderly subjects with normal renal function and to evaluate if changes in gMB might contribute to frailty in CKD. METHODS: We studied 64 CKD patients (stage 3b-4, eGFR 15-45 ml/min), categorized as frail (F) and not frail (NF) according to Fried's frailty phenotype score (FFP), and 15 not-frail control subjects with a normal renal function (C). All the subjects included in the study were older than 65. In all CKD patients and controls, we assessed serum C-reactive protein (CRP), blood neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (L/N), Malnutrition-inflammation-Score (MIS), and gMB composition studied by three methods: semi-quantitative (DGGE), high-throughput sequencing (16S ribosomal RNA), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: In the whole CKD cohort, the prevalence of frailty defined in accordance to FFP scale was 59%( 38 F and 26 NF). No significant differences in mean age (81,865,8 years in F and 79,0366,6 years in NF), BMI (28,7765,4 in F and 27,763,4 in NF), eGFR (25,6869,7 in F and 26,2613,3 in NF), CRP (0,3760,6 in F and 0,2660,24 in NF), N/L (2,5361 in F and 2.5161 in NF) and prevalence of diabetes (63% in F and 50% in NF) were found between F and NF. Conversely, MIS was significantly higher in F than in NF (7.6±5.4 vs 3.961.9, p<0.001). DGGE analysis revealed no significant difference in gMB biodiversity between CKD patients and C as well as between F and NF CKD patients. However, metagenomic analysis showed that CKD patients had higher relative abundance of some potentially noxius bacteria (Citrobacter, Coprobacillus, Anaerotruncus, Ruminococcus torques) and a reduced amount of saccharolytic and butyrate producing bacteria (Prevotella, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia) respect to Controls. Furthermore, in the whole CKD cohort the abundance of some bacteria (unclassified Mogibacteriaceae, Oscillospira) was directly proportional to inflammatory indices (CRP, MIS, N/L), while the abundance of others (Akkermansia, Ruminococcus, Eubacterium) was inversely proportional. Statistically significant differences were also found in bacterial abundance between F and NF CKD patients, with an increase of some genera (Mogibacteriacee, Coriobacteriacee, Eggerthella, Erwinia, Coprobacillus, Anaerotruncus, etc) in F patients. Many of these bacteria have been described as more abundant in other not-CKD frail individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that in CKD gut dysbiosis is associated to inflammation and frailty.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Incidence of end stage renal disease (ESRD) is rising and is likely to continue in future due to the fast growth of elderly patients, ageing of general population and low rate of transplantation access, particularly for elderly. In the last decade, every dialysis unit sees their patients mean age increasing which is associated to a higher burden of comorbidity and frailty, both of them possibly influence their disease outcomes and modalities health care. Methods: The aim of this study was, firstly, to assess the prevalence of frailty and its degree among a population of prevalent dialysis patients. Secondly, the distribution of this frailty was evaluated in different types of dialysis units (dialysis center and medical-ized hemodialysis unit).The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was evaluated in early 2017 with follow-up data still ongoing for one year. This prospective multicenter study (conducted in four centers across the East of France included 795 patients (mean age 68,4 +/-11,9;H/F 1,36 and mean dialysis lifespan 58 +/-46,2 months). 92% were treated by hemodialysis and 8% by peritoneal dialysis. The CFS score was collected by one identified nurse in each center.Every center had two types of facilities such as "dialysis center" and "medicalized hemodialysis unit" legally defined as follow: in "dialysis center" a nephrologist is permanently present while in « medicalized hemodialysis" only one medical visitit per week is required. Results: Global results were summarized in table 1. As predictive CFS scores increased with age, with patients above 75 years old frequently obtaining higher scores of 6,7,8,9. Moreover severely and very severely CFS scores (7 and 8) where highly correlated to patient's risk of death. Figure 1 showed that 67.7 % of patients in dialysis centers had a CFS score > 5 opposed to only 16.3 % in medicalized hemodialysis units. This suggests a good adequacy between nephrologist medical care and hemodialysis patient frailty.For subgroup analysis, the frailty scores were subdivided into three cate-gories-CFS scores 1-3 (managing well), CFS scores 4-5 (vulnerable to mildly frail), CFS scores 6-9 (moderate to severe frailty) A middle analysis of death rates at less than 12 months follow up showed a correlation three categories (K. Rockwood and coll., 2005) with 2%, 7% and 17 % of death in CFS scores 1-3; 4-5 and 6-9 respectively. The study is still ongoing. Mortality and morbidity rates will be collected and compared to CFS scores during future follows ups taking place 1 and 2 at years since initial collection. Tableau 1: Distribution of CFS score (1 to 9) in dialysis population (n= 795) Conclusions: A Clinical Frailty Scale which includes only 9 items and can be administered by nurses allows for the classification of dialysis patients. Frailty is commonly associated with adverse outcomes among prevalent dialysis patients. Thus future research efforts should focus on interventions aiming at preventing or attenuating frailty in this population. Being able to evaluate frailty with a simple score should be seen as an additional tool to both diagnose and adapt dialysis facilities unit and global care.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Frailty has been definedas asyndrome ora state of increased vulnerability resulting from a decline in biological functional reserves, such that the ability to cope with stressors is compromised, and leading to higher risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization and death. Our objective was to relate frailty-as measured by the Fried Phenotype Frail Index (FPFI) and the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS)-and comorbidity-as measured by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)-with the annual hospitalization rate, number of days at hospital and mortality rate in a cohort of hemodialysis prevalent patients. Methods: Frailty and comorbidity were measured byusing the FPFI, EFS and CCI and admissions to hospital, number of days at hospital and final outcomes (death, kidney transplantation or loss to follow-up) were recorded for the hemodialysis prevalent patients managed in an sanitary area. The study included 275 hemodialysis patients: 61.5% men, 57.5% diabetics, median age 65 years, and the mean time in hemodialysis was 50.4 months. The mean follow-up time was 10.84 months; 215 patients completed the 12-month follow-up; 42 died before completing it, 16 received kidney transplantation and 2 were transfered. Results: The proportion of frail patients was 41.1% as measured with the FPFI and 29.5% as measured with the EFS; 65% of patients presented CCI higher than 5, which is high or very high; 151 hospital admissions were recorded for 103 patients, with a total of 1403 and a mean of 9.29 days at hospital.Hospitalization and frailty according to the FPFI: 70 admissions in 47 patients out of 162 non-frail ones (FPFI) and 81 admissions in 56 patients out of 113 frail ones (FPFI). The annual hospitalization rate and number of days at hospital were significantly different between non-frail and frail patients: 0.55 vs. 0.99 p<0.001 and 4.38 vs. 10.50 p<0.001. Hospitalization and frailty according to the EFS: 91 admissions in 59 patients out of 194 non-frail ones (EFS) and 60 admissions in 44 patients out of 81 frail ones (EFS). The annual hospitalization rate and number of days at hospital were significantly different between non-frail and frail patients: 0.61 vs. 1.02p<0.001 and 4.58 vs. 12.45 p<0.001. Hospitalization andCCI >5: 45 admissions in 31 patients out of 97 ones with CCI<5 and 106 admissions in 72 patients out of 178 with CCI>5. The annual hospitalization rate and number of days at hospital were not significantly different between both groups 0.55 vs. 0.83 (n.s.) and 4.09 vs. 8.45 p=0.059. Regarding mortality, 11.1% non-frail patients and 21.2% frail ones died, according to the FPFI p<0.05; 10.3% non-frail patients and 27.2% frail ones according to the EFS p<0.005;and 10.4% patients with CCI <5 versus 18% patients with CCI>5 (n.s.). In a multivariate analysis, where other variables were included, such as sex, age, diabetes, time in dialysis, serum albumin and serum phosphorus, only frailty measured by the EFS was associated with mortality. Conclusions: In conclusion, higher hospitalization rate and number of days at hospital were demonstrated in patients classified as frail by the FPFI and EFS, with stronger association than that of the Charlson comorbidity index. Results also suggest that the frailty indexes could be even better predictors of mortality than the comorbidity index.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Frailty has been defined as a syndrome or a state of increased vulnerability resulting from a decline in biological functional reserves, such that the ability to cope with stressors is compromised, and leading to higher risk of poor health outcomes, disability, hospitalization and death. Our objective was to relate frailty, as measured by the Fried Phenotype Frail Index (FPFI) and the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS), and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) with the annual frequency of visits to hospital emergency service in a cohort of hemodialysis patients. Methods: To that end, frailty, according to the FPFI and EFS and CCI were meas-ured and the number of visits to the hospital emergency service for any cause was recorded for the hemodialysis prevalent patients managed in our sanitary area. the study included 375 hemodialysis patients, 61.5% of them were men, 57.5% suffered from diabetes mellitus, their median age was 65 years and the mean time in hemodialysis was 50.4 (3-318) months. The mean follow-up time was 10.84 months; 215 patients completed the 12.month follow-up; 42 patients died before completing it, 16 received kidney transplantation and 2 were transfered. Results: The proportion of frail patients was 41.1% as measured with the FPFI and 29.5% as measured with the EFS; 65% of patients presented CCI higher than 5, which is high or very high. During the follow-up period, 507 visits to the emergency services were recorded. According to the FPFI, the annual rate of visits to the emergency services was 1.61 62.7 for non-frail patients and 3.2864.2 for frail ones (P<0.001). Also accord-ing to the FPFI, 45.6% of non-frail and 22.1% of frail patients did not visit the emergency services during a year. According to the EFS, the annual rate of visits to the emergency services was 1.70 62.8 for non-frail patients and 3.72 64.5 for frail ones (P<0.001). Also according to the FPFI, 45.3% of non-frail and 13.5% of frail patients did not visit the emergency services during a year. The annual rate of visits to the emergency services was 1.87 63.3 for patients with CCI equal to or lower than 5 and 2.53 63.6 for those with CCI higher than 5 (P<0.05);44.7% of patients with CCI<5 and 31.4% of those with CCI> 5 did not visit the emergency services during a year (n.s.). Conclusions: In conclusion, the frequency of visits to the hospital emergency services was significantly higher for hemodialysis patients classified as frail by both indexes. Frailty indexes seemed to be better predictors of higher frequency of visits to the emergency services than the Charlson comorbidity index.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Kidney biopsy is the golden standard for renal disease diagnosis and treatment. Nevertheless, in older subjects risk and clinical outcomes are dependent from a combination of biological, functional, psychological, and environmental factors. Tools that effectively identify patients with different life expectancies should be multidimensional. A Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI) for 1-year mortality derived from a standardized Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) was developed for this purpose. No data are available regarding the association between frailty index and clinical outcomes in elderly subjects undergoing kidney biopsy. Aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of MPI for predicting mortality, treatment failure and requirement of chronic dialysis in elderly patients after renal biopsy. Methods: Biopsy and clinical data from 67 patients aged >65 years were retrospectively collected revising renal biopsies performed in our department from January 2015 to June 2017. Follow-up period was at least 6 months. Patients were stratified at the time of renal biopsy according to both age (65-74 years; >75 years) and MPI (low-frailty: MPI-1; medium-frailty: MPI-2; high-frailty: MPI-3). Clinical outcomes were death from any cause, response to therapy, need of chronic RRT, biopsy-related complications and therapy-related complications. Data are reported as mean 6 SD and t-test or ANOVA have been used to compare groups. Results: Cohort consisted of 67 patients, 30 women (44.8%) and 37 men (55.2%), mean age was 75 66,2 years. Neither biopsy-related complications nor therapy-related complications were observed in the cohort studied. Death was more frequent in older patients ranging from low-frailty to high-frailty patients (with MPI-1 (MPI 1=8.8 %, MPI 2=25.9%), being 100% in patients with MPI 3 (p<0.05). The frequency of treatment failure was similar in the two age groups (41.9% in 65-74 years vs 44.4% in over 75), but it increased according to frailty grading (MPI-1=44,1%, MPI-2=63%,MPI-3=100%; p<0,05). According to the age stratification, no differences were observed in the percentage of patients requiring chronic dialysis; by contrast, patients with higher MPI showed higher probability to continue dialytic treatment (MPI-1 = 14.7%, MPI-2= 44.4%, MPI-3=66.7%; p<0,05). Data are summarized in Figure1. Conclusions: Kidney biopsy and related treatment are safe in the elderly. Clinical outcomes are not depending on age at the biopsy, while frailty index might better identify patients with worst outcome in terms of treatment failure and need of chronic dialysis. In conclusion, MPI could be considered a useful tool to identify patients at higher risk helping clinicians in evaluating risks and benefits of the diagnostic procedure.

N2  - Introduction: Frailty syndrome (FS) is a multidimensional problem associated with high dependency and mortality rate. The evidence shows that early identification of FS can improve management and outcomes in elderly patients. The relationship between age and frailty is not completely understood. Individuals of the same chronological age vary in terms of their biological age, which depends on the stage of aging processes and the number of co-morbidities. Multiple conditions in a frail person can trigger physical, psychological or social decline. Case report description: A multidimensional FS assessment was carried out in two women (WA and WB) of the same age (70 y/o) hospitalized in Intensive Cardiac Unit. Data (ICU) on pre-existing diseases and test results were obtained from medical records. Both of them were widows, supported by their children. WA did not work while WB was still professionally active. The women differed in the some aspects. WA had many co-morbidities, such as: chronic heart failure (HF), NYHA III/IV (with triple decompensation in 2017), hypertension, diabetes type 2, chronic kidney disease, arrhythmias, history of heart attacks (PCI treatment and ultimately CABG in 2006). On admission due to decompensation of HF and heart attack she complained of cardiac symptoms, shortness of breath, dizziness and reduced exercise tolerance. In turn, WB was admitted to the ICU due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) STEMI (stenocardial pain lasted only for an hour) and the only with dyslipidemia and kidney stones. She did not complain of any pain but sometimes she felt anxiety associated with hospitalization. The following screening tools were used: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive function (CF), Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS), FRAIL scale (FSc) for FS, WHOQOL-Bref for quality of life (QoL), EPWORTH scale (ES) for sleep problems and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) for depressive symptoms (DS). The results obtained by the women (A and B, respectively) were as follows: MMSE (pts): 24 (cognitive impairment (CI)) vs. 28 (no CI) TFI (pts): 11 (FS) vs. 1 (no FS); EFS (pts): 10 (moderate FS) vs. 1 (no FS) FSc (pts): 4 (FS) vs. 0 (robust) ES (pts): 15 (moderate excessive) vs. 3 (lower normal) daytime sleepiness CES-D (pts): 27 (DS) vs. 10 (no DS). In all QoL domains, WA chose the poor or neither satisfied nor dissatisfied answers, while WB always reported good or very satisfied QoL. Conclusions: All the scores in all the measures revealed that woman A had CI with FS, poor QoL and high DS while woman B had no FS, proper CF, good QoL and no DS. The comparison confirmed that the same age does not have to mean that two different patients are at the same level of multiple biopsychosocial decline. Only a multidisciplinary approach and frailty screening tools in acute care can be useful in identifying FS, planning complex assessment, creating appropriate care plan and discharge.

N2  - Objectives: Acute kidney injury frequently complicates critical illness and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Frailty is common in critical illness survivors, but little is known about the impact of acute kidney injury. We examined the association of acute kidney injury and frailty within a year of hospital discharge in survivors of critical illness. Design: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study. Setting: Medical/surgical ICU of a U.S. tertiary care medical center. Patients: Three hundred seventeen participants with respiratory failure and/or shock. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Acute kidney injury was determined using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stages. Clinical frailty status was determined using the Clinical Frailty Scale at 3 and 12 months following discharge. Covariates included mean ICU Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score as well as baseline comorbidity (i.e., Charlson Comorbidity Index), kidney function, and Clinical Frailty Scale score. Of 317 patients, 243 (77%) had acute kidney injury and one in four patients with acute kidney injury was frail at baseline. In adjusted models, acute kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 were associated with higher frailty scores at 3 months (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.14-3.24; odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.31-4.42; and odds ratio, 4.41; 95% CI, 2.20-8.82, respectively). At 12 months, a similar association of acute kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 and higher Clinical Frailty Scale score was noted (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11-3.14; odds ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.94-3.48; and odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.34-5.66, respectively). In supplemental and sensitivity analyses, analogous patterns of association were observed. Conclusions: Acute kidney injury in survivors of critical illness predicted worse frailty status 3 and 12 months postdischarge. These findings have important implications on clinical decision making among acute kidney injury survivors and underscore the need to understand the drivers of frailty to improve patient-centered outcomes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Background: The prevalence of falls among Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD-5) patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD) therapy ranges from 26.3% to 47%, and is considerably higher than in the general healthy population. In addition to traditional risk factors such as older age, frailty, comorbidity, and polypharmacy, these patients often present with dizziness and pre-syncopal events as a result of the combined effect ofHDtherapy and cardiovascular disease, which may contribute to an increased risk of falling. Particularly, it has been suggested that the dysregulation of blood pressure during orthostasis may play a role in the aetiology of falls in these patients. Purpose of the study: To compare the haemodynamic responses to a passive orthostatic challenge, as well as the baroreflex function, in HD patients with and without history of falls. METHODS: We recruited 62 adult people on HD from a single Renal Unit between October 2015 and December 2016. Fifty-two patients completed all baseline assessments and were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were classified as “fallers” and “non-fallers” based on self-reported history of falls in the previous 12 months and objective recordings of falls over a 12 month period from the baseline assessment. Participants completed a passive orthostatic challenge consisting of lying down supine for 15 minutes, followed by head up tilting (HUT) at 60 degrees for 5 minutes on an automated tilt table. ECG signals, continuous (contBP) and oscillometric (OscBP) blood pressure measurements, and impedance cardiography were recorded continuously using the Task ForceVR Monitor 3040i (CNS systems, Graz, Austria), and the following variables were derived from these measurements: heart rate (HR) stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR), number of baroreceptor events, and baroreceptor effectiveness index (BEI). Following normality checks, the comparison of “fallers” vs “non-fallers” was performed by means of either independent t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests. Significance levels were set at alpha= 0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-nine participants were classified as fallers (age= 57.4±14.3 years, gender= 55.2% M, dialysis vintage= 23.1±26.2 months, BMI= 27.2566.21, CCI= 5.162.3) and 23 as non-fallers (age=63.4±14.4 years, gender= 65.2% M, dialysis vintage =16.5±15.6 months, BMI= 30.3966.09, CCI= 5.162). No significant differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were found between groups. Fallers experienced a significantly larger drop in systolic OscBP from supine to HUT (-8.87 vs-0.93 mmHg) compared with non-fallers. In addition, fallers had a lower number of baroreceptor events (6.869.1 vs 14.4±16.4) and down-regulatory BEI (24.5±28.7% vs 40.3±15.3%) in the supine position. No differences in HR, SV, CO, TPR, and contBP were detected between the two groups at rest or in response to HUT. CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional comparison indicates that, at rest, HD patients with a positive history of falls present with worse baroreflex function, as highlighted by the lower number of baroreceptor-mediated sequences of coupled HR and BP. Shortterm BP regulation warrants further investigation as BP drops during the transition from supine to HUT may be implicated in the aetiology of falls in HD.

N2  - Objective: Major lower extremity amputations (MLEAs) remain a significant source of disability. It is unknown whether postamputation functional outcomes and outcome predictability have changed with a population of increasingly aging and obese patients. Accordingly, we sought to evaluate contemporary trends. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients undergoing MLEA using Current Procedural Terminology codes in a university hospital. Demographics, comorbidities, perioperative variables, and outcomes were obtained. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, and χ2 and multivariate logistic regression modeling were used where appropriate. Survival analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: From October 2005 to November 2016, 206 patients (147 male; mean age, 63 ± 13.5 years) underwent 256 MLEAs (90.9% below-knee amputations, 1.3% through-knee amputations, and 7.8% above-knee amputations [AKAs]) related to acute and critical limb ischemia, infection, or other causes. Mean follow-up was 178.7 ± 266.9 days. Conversion from below-knee amputation to AKA was 3.5%. Estimated 1-year survival was 83%, and it was 15% lower in nonambulatory patients (75% vs 90%; P =.04). Overall 1-year postamputation ambulatory rate was 46.1%. Nonambulatory patients had a higher body mass index (30.9 ± 8.0 vs 25.6 ± 5.4; P <.001), lower preoperative hematocrit (31.0% ± 7.4% vs 33.3% ± 8.1%; P <.05), higher modified frailty index (mFI; 8.4 ± 1.0 vs 5.4 ± 1.2; P <.0001), higher chronic alcohol use (9% vs 1%; P =.01), dependent preoperative functional status (29% vs 2.1%; P <.01), and lack of family support (66.3% vs 17.9%; P <.01); they were less likely to be married (83.2% vs 35.8%; P <.01) and more likely to have an AKA (20% vs 52.6%; P =.004). There were no patients with dementia, on dialysis, or with bilateral MLEAs who were ambulatory after amputation. Factors predictive of nonambulatory status after MLEA with multivariate logistic regression analysis included increased body mass index (odds ratio [OR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.98; P =.017) and an increased mFI (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.16-0.34; P <.0001); a higher hemoglobin level was protective (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.03-1.62; P =.019). Conclusions: Patients should be counseled that <50% of patients receiving MLEAs are ambulatory after amputation. Educating patients about the deleterious effects of obesity on ambulatory status after MLEA may motivate patients to improve their level of fitness to achieve successful ambulation. Patients with an elevated mFI, patients with dementia, and those on dialysis should be considered for AKAs.

N2  - Patients with diabetes receiving haemodialysis are frail with multiple comorbidities. We identified that many patients were missing essential diabetes and screening assessments due to difficulties attending appointments around dialysis sessions. The standard model of care was not meeting the needs of this patient cohort. As a potential solution we have introduced a mobile diabetes clinic at the bedside in the dialysis unit. Our dialysis unit provides maintenance haemodialysis to 182 patients. 35% (n=63) have diabetes. 51 patients (mean age 67.5 years) were reviewed by the diabetes team in the dialysis unit. 90.2% (n=46) had type 2 diabetes. Mean HbA1c and duration of diabetes were 69.0mmol/mol and 19.7 years respectively. 66.7% were treated with insulin. 51% had diabetic nephropathy (n=26). 27.5% were not receiving regular diabetes review. Patients are frail and described difficulty travelling to appointments. 88.2% required assistance with transport and 72.5% used a mobility aid or wheelchair. Mortality during this period was 12.7% (n=8). 37.3% of patients had not attended retinal screening in the previous year and we now offer retinal screening in the dialysis unit. 17.6% had not received a foot check within the past year. 21.6% had active foot disease and were reviewed by podiatry onsite. Feedback has been overwhelmingly supportive from patients, carers and the MDT. Our data demonstrates a frail cohort with multiple complications who require specialist input from the diabetes multidisciplinary team. We responded to our patient's needs and initiated a mobile diabetes clinic, ensuring they had access to the specialist care they require.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Home-based peritoneal dialysis treatments need accurate follow-up to prevent minor and major complications urgent hospital admissions and unplanned visits. Moreover frail and elderly dialysis patients need routine and unplanned home visits for their comfort and safety. The introduction of the new remote patient monitoring RPM (Baxter Claria-Sharesource) system for APD offers the possibility of a daily control of home dialysis sessions. This system has radically changed routine patients control introducing an interaction between dialysis center and patients more frequent and effective in prevention of the complications. Methods: Wehave studied 25 prevalent patients aged 70613 years inhome APD 6 months before (HC) and 6 months after (CS) the introduction of the new technology, for a follow-up of respectively 108 and 99 patient-months. Their home distance from the dialysis center was 25615 km and 24% of them was in mountain area. Results: The phone calls of the patients to the center for any cause were reduced from 125 HC to 93 CS (26%), the calls from the center to the patients at home were increased from 278 HC to 311 CS (12%). Planned follow-up visits were stable 139 HC and 132 CS, unplanned urgent visits were reduced from 60 HC to 41 CS (32%), emergency room access were reduced from 4 HC to 2 CS (50%) and hospital admissions were reduced from 6 HC to 4 CS (33%). During the study 7 changes of therapy pre-scription were done using the RPM system. Conclusions: The study has been supported by the Regional Health System of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region to evaluate the organization and economic impact of the RPM technology and will be in-depth analyzed with HTA methodology. These preliminary data are very positive showing great advantages also in this small number of patients and adding safety and satisfaction both in health operators and patients in home APD.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: In many countries, it is increasingly difficult to put patients on PD because they getting more frail, more elderly and many of them are multi-morbid. Many of the patients have impairments that seem to be an additional barrier to PD. These are manifold and potential patient restrictions range from tactile or visual restrictions, to , dexterity shortfalls, arthritis or other causes. The aim was to understand how a newly developed auto-connect device would allow more patients to be treated at home. With what kind of patients would such a device make patients and health care professionals feel safer and how many patients could profit from such a device. METHODS: A survey performed at EuroPD 2017 encompassing interviews with 29 respondents, thereof 45% nephrologists, 45% nurses and therapy specialists and 10% others. The respondents were shown the video of the device and its functionality and then they had to discuss and rate pre-defined patient profiles and statements. RESULTS: The majority immediately recognized the potential of the PeripalVR System to protect from infections and appreciated its functional simplicity. Five patient profiles were confirmed by at least two thirds of respondents: visual/dexterity impairment (93%), patients exposed to an increased infection risk (83%), patients at the edge of assistance (76%), Patients with anxiety (72%), Patients who already suffered from peritonitis (66%). CONCLUSIONS: The survey confirmed the key advantages of such a device for home dialysis patients. 26% would use it for 6-20% of their patients, 30% of respondents would use it for 21-35%of their patients. The data suggests that more patients can be treated at home with such a device (Figure presented).

N2  - We present a 77-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with nephrotic-range proteinuria, microhematuria, renal impairment, and extremely elevated blood pressure. She had a long history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes. Renal biopsy revealed fibrillary deposits in the mesangium and glomerular basement membrane consistent with fibrillary glomerulopathy (FGN), with crescentic changes and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). We could not identify any radiological, clinical, or laboratory evidence of autoimmune disorders, lymphoproliferative disorders, and malignancy. It was decided not to offer her any immunosuppressive therapy, as she was frail with substantial renal damage on the biopsy. Five months after presentation, she gradually progressed to requiring renal replacement therapy and is currently on maintenance hemodialysis. Crescentic changes in FGN, though rare, have been previously described, but the concurrent presence of TMA has never been previously reported.

N2  - The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625-651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467-1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA. Additional information and downloads of the text and anticoagulation cards in different languages can be found on an EHRA website (www.NOACforAF.eu).

N2  - Background and Aims: Hospitalizations in patients are the major cause of morbidity and healthcare expenditure in patients with cirrhosis. Predictive factors determining which outpatients with cirrhosis are at highest risk for unplanned admissions are lacking.We aimed to study factors predicting unplanned hospitalization or death at 3 months and study utility of Clinical Frailty scale in outpatients with cirrhosis. Method: Prospective study with all the assessment carried out on the same day with study population comprising consecutive outpatients with cirrhosis in a single Tertiary care centre. Patients with active malignancy, ESRD and any condition requiring immediate admission were excluded. Frailty was defined as Clinical frailty scale (CFS) >4. Unplanned hospitalization was defined as any admission to acute care hospital that was not planned. Data on socioeconomic status, MELD, CHILD score, Burden of total comorbidity using Charlson comorbidity index were recorded. The outcome was defined as unplanned hospitalization or/and death at 1 and 3 months from study entry. Variables found to be significant with P < 0.05 on univariate analysiswere used for Binary backward logistic regression. Results: Overall 124 patients included, 52(41.9%) were frail, Etiology was predominantly alcohol 63/124 (51%) followed by HBV 30/124 (24%) then NASH 12/124(16.7%) related cirrhosis. Mean MELDwas 20 and CTP score was 10.6 in frail patients.CFS mean value was 5.2 with CRP mean of 3.2 mg/dl in frail outpatients. 26/52 (50%) of frail patients as compared to 2/72 (2.8%) non-frail patients had unplanned hospitalization at 1 month whereas 44/52(84.6%) as compared to 11/ 72(15.3%) had unplanned hospitalization at 3 months. 9/52 (17.3%) frail patients died in comparison to only 1/72(1.46%) in the non-Frail group at 3 months. On Univariate regression analysis variables found to have p values <0.05 were considered for Multivariate cox regression analysis. Multivariate Binary logistic regression (Backward LR) patients taking B- blocker more than 20 mg with P < 0.07, OR 7.16(CI 1.73-29.6), Frail patients with CFS > 4 P < 0.01, OR:5.38(CI: 1.3-21.6), Presence of AKI with P < 0.006, OR:17.24 (CI:2.2-133.7), CRP >2 mg/dl with P < 0.001, OR:11.23 (CI:2.6-47) were found to independently predict unplanned admission at 1 month and unplanned admission/death at 3 months. We also observed that CRP with a cut-off of 2 mg/dl with sensitivity of 77.5% and specificity of 92.42% with AUC of 0.88 predicted unplanned hospitalization/death at 3 months. Conclusion: Clinical frailty scale as rapid 1-minute screen and Serum CRP with a cut-off 2 mg/dl predicts unplanned hospitalization and/or death at 3 months and can be utilized in outpatients with cirrhosis for stratifying patients at risk of adverse outcomes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Surgical complications are often difficult to predict, despite existing preoperative assessment tools. Frailty has been shown to forecast postoperative complication rates and discharge disposition. We sought to evaluate the use of a frailty index as a predictive tool on patients undergoing percutaneous renal surgery at a high-volume center. METHODS: Frailty was prospectively analyzed prior to surgery in all consenting patients using the Hopkins Frailty Index, consisting of 5 components yielding an additive score. Patients were categorized as not frail, intermediate, or severely frail, depending on overall score. Primary outcomes assessed were complications during admission and the 30-day complication rate. Secondary outcomes included overall hospital length of stay (LOS) and discharge disposition. RESULTS: The analysis included 78 patients who underwent percutaneous renal surgery. In total, 58 (74%), 13 (17%), and 7 (9%) patients were in the not frail, intermediate, and frail categories. Overall, intermediate or frail patients were more likely to have underlying chronic kidney disease (p < 0.05), anemia (p < 0.01), or prior abdominal surgery (p < 0.04). Intraoperatively, intermediate or frail patients were not more likely to experience higher blood loss or to have a higher stone burden. Of the five frailty metrics, grip strength alone was predictive of post-operative complications (p < 0.01). When compared with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), frailty class alone was predictive of the incidence of complications during admission (p < 0.03), but not 30-day postoperative complications (p = 0.33). Extended length of stay (p < 0.001), along with specific complications like fever (p < 0.0063), sepsis (p < 0.0001), bacteremia (p < 0.0004), hemorrhage requiring embolization (p < 0.03), and hemodynamic instability requiring intensive care (ICU) admission (p < 0.0008) were more common with in individuals with higher frailty scores. Frailer individuals tended to require higher level of care upon hospital discharge (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: While established preoperative assessment tools (ASA and CCI) were not predictive of complication rates in our cohort, higher frailty scores were associated with immediate postoperative complications. The frailty phenotype may give better insight into prediction of post-operative outcomes and may represent potentially modifiable factors for patient optimization prior to surgery. Moreover, it provides additional data in preoperative patient counseling.

N2  - Background: Patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) are at a higher risk of recurrent healthcare resource utilization due to multiple comorbidities, frailty and advanced age. The 30- day all-cause readmission rate has been reported at 15-20%. We sought to devise a simple tool to identify patients undergoing endovascular TAVR at higher risk of 30-day readmission. Methods: We used the Nationwide Readmissions Databases from January 2013 to September 2015. Complex survey methods, hierarchical regression, and the 'rms' library in R 3.4.2 were implemented to create a prediction ruler to determine probability for 30-day readmission. We performed internal calibration with bootstrapping to assess validity. Results are presented at the 95% confidence level. Results: Of 39,305 patients who underwent endovascular TAVR, 6,380 (16.2%) were readmitted within 30 days. The final 30-day readmission risk prediction tool included the following variables: chronic kidney disease, end stage renal disease on dialysis, anemia, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, atrial fibrillation, length of stay, acute kidney injury, and discharge disposition. The risk tool is shown in Figure 1. A score of≥212 was associated with a >30% readmission rate. The c-statistic of the prediction model was 0.63. Conclusion: This simple risk prediction tool may help identify TAVR patients at increased risk of 30-day readmission and aid in appropriate transition of care upon discharge and post-discharge follow-up. The tool can also be incorporated into modern day electronic medical record platforms. (Table presented).

N2  - Background/Aim: Although malignant tumours can occur in people of all ages, cancer disproportionately affects those aged 65 years and older, and the number of elderly patients with cancer will increase substantially in the coming decades as a result of increasing life expectancy and population ageing. The guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the International Society of Geriatric Oncology, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer recommend that all patients with cancer age 70 years old undergo some form of geriatric assessment. In geriatric practice, the G8 screening tool represents a valid instrument for the identification of functional decline in oncological elderly patients. Recently it has demonstrated good predictive value in surgery to identify fragile patient candidates for oncological abdominal surgery. Our study has the objective to define if G8 score is a good tool to identify the risk of post-operative complications in elderly patients (≥70 years) undergoing radical cystectomy (RC). Patients and Methods: From January 2012 to August 2017, we recruited 56 patients 70 years old or older at the surgical time, undergone RC. Median age was 76 years (SD=4.37), 41 patients were male (73.2%) and 15 patients female (26.8%). Median BMI was 25.73 (SD=4.03). 8 patients (14.3%) were affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus, 32 (57.1%) suffered hypertension and 18 (32.1%) had stage III or higher chronic kidney disease. The G8 screening questionnaire was performed to all patients preoperatively, and fragile patients were identified with a score ≤14. We registered intra operative complications, post-operative complications and their gravity using Clavien Dindo scale, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and its variation postoperatively, length of hospital stay after surgery and readmission rate within 30 days. We compared the clinicopathological data between the frail (G8 score <=14) and not frail (G8 score >14) group. Statistical analysis was made by computing software SPSS. Results: Median preoperative G8 score was 13.65 (SD=2.3). Patients were divided in fragile (N=35, 62.5%) and not fragile (N=21, 37.5%). Intra-operative complications were registered in 1 patients (2.8%) with G8 score ≤14 and 0 pt (0%) with G8>14 (p=0.625). Post-operative complications occurred in 24 patients (68.5%) with G8 score ≤14 and 8 patients (38.09%) with G8>14 (p=0.025), 12 and none of them had a Clavien Score ≥3 respectively (p=0.015). Postoperative eGFR was 61.45 (SD=29.2) in G8≤14 group and 57.66 (SD=25.84) in G8>14 group (p=0.62) and median variation between pre- and postoperative eGFR was 7.8 (SD=27.43) and 8.0 (SD=26.01) for each group (p=0.97). Median hospital stay was 25.45 days (SD=11.01) for fragile patients and 24.23 days (SD=11.32) for patients not fragile (p=0.69). Five patients (14.28%) with G8 score≤14 were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, and for 6 patients (28.57%) with G8 score>14 was necessary to be hospitalized (p=0.298). No significant difference was registered for overall mortality (p=0.23) and cancer related mortality (p=0.53) between the two groups. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the G8 screening tool represents a good predictive instrument for RC morbidity, identifying fragile patients at risk of post-operative complications and their severity. However, it doesn't demonstrate good affability in identification of patients at risk of intraoperative complications and within 30 days of operation with necessity of hospital readmission. Considering these results, it is possible to perform safely and efficiently this screening test for frailty in older patients qualified for RC. This instrument may offer physicians additional information that can be used in the postoperative optimization of the treatment of the high-risk group of patients. However further analyses are necessary to confirm the data obtained from this preliminary study.

N2  - Aims: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality after 1-year follow-up. Methods: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the occurrence of death after 1 year. Results: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index. Conclusions: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing the risk of death in these frail patients.

N2  - The number of elderly people has increased considerably over the last decades, due to a rising life expectancy and ageing populations. As a result, an increased number of elderly with end-stage-renal-disease are diagnosed, for which the preferred treatment is renal transplantation. Over the past years the awareness of the elderly as a specific patient population has grown, which increases the importance of research in this group. Elderly patients often receive kidneys from elderly donors while younger donor kidneys are preferentially reserved for younger recipients. Although the rate of acute rejection after transplantation is lower in the elderly, these rejections may lead to graft loss more frequently, as kidneys from elderly donors have marginal reserve capacity. To prevent acute rejection, immunosuppressive therapy is needed. On the other hand, elderly patients have a higher risk to die from infectious complications, and thus less immunosuppression would be preferable. Immunosuppressive treatment in the elderly is complicated further by changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with increasing age. Adjustments in standard immunosuppressive regimes are therefore suggested for this population. An unmet need in transplantation medicine is a tool to guide a personalized approach to immunosuppression. Recently several promising biomarkers that identify injury to the graft at an early stage or predict acute rejection have been identified. Unfortunately, none of these biomarkers were tested specifically in the elderly. We believe there is an urgent need to perform clinical trials investigating novel immunosuppressive regimens in conjunction with biomarker studies in this specific population.

N2  - Many of the >2 million animal species that inhabit Earth have developed survival mechanisms that aid in the prevention of obesity, kidney disease, starvation, dehydration and vascular ageing; however, some animals remain susceptible to these complications. Domestic and captive wild felids, for example, show susceptibility to chronic kidney disease (CKD), potentially linked to the high protein intake of these animals. By contrast, naked mole rats are a model of longevity and are protected from extreme environmental conditions through mechanisms that provide resistance to oxidative stress. Biomimetic studies suggest that the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) offers protection in extreme environmental conditions and promotes longevity in the animal kingdom. Similarly, during months of fasting, immobilization and anuria, hibernating bears are protected from muscle wasting, azotaemia, thrombotic complications, organ damage and osteoporosis-features that are often associated with CKD. Improved understanding of the susceptibility and protective mechanisms of these animals and others could provide insights into novel strategies to prevent and treat several human diseases, such as CKD and ageing-associated complications. An integrated collaboration between nephrologists and experts from other fields, such as veterinarians, zoologists, biologists, anthropologists and ecologists, could introduce a novel approach for improving human health and help nephrologists to find novel treatment strategies for CKD.

N2  - Although the incidence of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) increases with age, studies focusing on elderly patients with ITP are lacking. We retrospectively reviewed the notes from patients with ITP, aged 60 or older, who were managed at the Hammersmith Hospital between 2001 and 2017. We analysed clinical characteristics, response to treatment and incidence of adverse events, including death, bleeding, thrombosis, sepsis and development of malignancies. Results: 47 patients (54% of whom were female), were analysed. Median age was 68 (range 60-88); 35% of patients were 75 or older. The median duration of follow up was 46 months (range 1-200 months). Median platelet count at diagnosis was 14 9 109/l (range 1-90 9 109/l); 80% of patients had a platelet count below 30 9 109/l. Despite the low platelet count, only 31% of patients had bleeding manifestations at diagnosis. The majority of patients (90%) had multiple comorbidities and the most common were type II dia-betes, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Most patients (89%) required treatment. 88% responded to first line treatment. The best and most durable response rates were observed when intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) were used as first line treatment, followed by steroids alone or in combination with IVIG. The majority of patients (67%) relapsed after first line treatment and 39% required 4 or more lines of treatment to achieve a response. One in four patients (25%) received Rituximab as second line or third line treatment with response rates of 40%. Thrombopoetin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) were used in 32% of patients with excellent response rates (93%). Only 4 patients (8%) underwent splenectomy with a response rate of 50%. Two patients developed intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). Thrombotic complications were observed in two patients: one had retinal vein thrombosis and a second patient had a stroke. Two deaths occurred during the follow up: one due to ICH in a patient who failed to respond to three consecutive lines of treatment and had multiple comorbidities and one patient died from complications related to Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma diagnosed 23 years after ITP. No patients developed severe infections. Four patients (8.5%) developed cancer during follow up. Management of elderly patients with ITP can be very challenging due to their increased risk of bleeding and thrombosis, frailty and reduced tolerance to treatment. Clinical guidelines for this group of patients are required to improve response rates and limit adverse events.

N2  - Purpose: When predicting patient outcomes after LVAD implant, it is important to consider their disease state. In particular, patients with an ischemic versus non-ischemic disease etiology have different disease features. In this study we identified unique risk factors for mortality at 12 months post-LVAD for patients in these groups. Methods: We analyzed patients from INTERMACS who received a CF-LVAD between 2012 and 2015. Analyses were done using R. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were used to select models as part of the variable selection procedure. Generalized logistic regression models were fitted to analyze relationships between risk factors and mortality. Results: Out of 5,343 CF-LVAD patients with non-ischemic etiology, 740 (16%) died by 12 months post-LVAD implant, compared to 920 (20%) out of 4,473 patients with ischemic etiology. A chi-squared test showed a significant difference (p-value < 0.0001) between ischemic etiology and 12-month mortality. Significant risk factors that were common in both non-ischemic and ischemic patient groups were age, gender, and chronic renal disease. In particular, being 60 years and older and having chronic renal disease increased the likelihood of mortality at 12 months post-VAD, while being male decreased the likelihood. For patients with non-ischemic etiology, being Caucasian is associated with an increased in mortality at 12 months post-LVAD (p-value = 0.0483). Other significant risk factors included malnutrition (p-value = 0.0496) and limited social support (p-value = 0.055). For patients with ischemic etiology, the significant risk factors were frailty (p-value = 0.0001), history of lymphoma leukemia (p-value = 0.0159), and history of solid organ cancer (p-value = 0.0315). History of alcohol abuse, drug use, smoking, pulmonary hypertension, and severe diabetes were also included in the models, but no statistically significant relationships were found for either population. Conclusion: Between ischemic and non-ischemic patients, the probability of mortality differed even when there were common risk factors. However, we found non-common risk factors to distinguished both groups. Ongoing analysis is being done to determine interaction terms and analyze relationships between factors, for example age and gender.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: While increasingly utilized, Partial nephrectomy (PN) in the elderly is controversial due to several factors including advanced co-morbidities associated with decreasing life expectancy, and potential impact of procedure specific complications due to patient frailty. We aimed to evaluate the short-term outcomes of partial nephrectomy in patients over 75 years old using Trifecta as s composite outcome of Surgical Quality. METHODS: Multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with aged 75 years or older who underwent PN [REnal SURGery in Elderly (RESURGE) Group]. Primary outcome was achievement of trifecta [negative surgical margin, no urological complications, and ≥90% eGFR (glomerular filtration rate) recovery]. Secondary outcomes included overall survival, de novo chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III. Multivariable analysis (MVA) was used to evaluate risk factors associated with achieving trifecta and renal functional outcomes. Kaplan Meier analysis was used to calculate survival probability and freedom from new onset of CKD stage III. RESULTS: We analyzed 949 patients (mean age 78.3 years, median follow-up 32 months) Trifecta rate was 39.4% (374). Compared to patients who did not achieve Trifecta, patients with positive trifecta had lower preoperative eGFR (57.3 vs. 62.5, p=0.028), greater frequency of cT1 disease (96.4% vs. 94.6%, p=0.028), lower and lower RENAL score (6.4 vs. 7.2, p=0.001). Trifecta positive patients similar less estimated blood loss (204.2 ml vs. 328.4 ml, p=0.003) but similar ischemia times (22.8 vs. 23.8 min, p=0.609), and 30 day readmission rates (1.3% vs. 3.6%, p=0.650). MVA for predictive factors for Trifecta revealed Low and intermediate RENAL score [HR 6.8-4.8, p=0.011 to 0.039, respectively], and minimal invasive surgery (MIS) [HR 1.70; p=0.039] as being associated with higher likelihood to achieve Trifecta. Kaplan Meier analysis did not demonstrate difference in overall survival among patients with cT1a and cT1b+ and with and without positive Trifecta (p=0.189). MVA for predictors for de novo CKD Stage III showed lack of trifecta (HR 9.1, p=0.001) as an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Partial nephrectomy in older patients is feasible with acceptable short-term morbidity and renal functional quality outcomes. Achievement of Trifecta as a short term quality composite outcome also correlated with decreased risk of longer term functional sequelae such as development of CKD.

N2  - Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa …), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation, pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H. influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome, increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

N2  - Background: Due to the increase in average life expectancy and the higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, more elderly patients present for cardiac surgery nowadays. At the same time, age has been considered a predictor of morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to evaluate the short-term outcomes of cardiac surgery in elderly patients. Methods: We conducted a descriptive retrospective study including elderly patients who underwent cardiac surgery from January 2012 to 31st of December 2016. All patients were hospitalized before and after cardiac surgery in the cardiology department of Habib Thameur Hospital. Results: Our study included 55 patients. Average age was 72±6 years old and sex-ratio was two. Eighty-five percent presented with angina, 18% with dyspnea and one patient with an aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis. Mean left ventricular function was 54 ±9 %. Mean EuroSCORE II was 1.91±1.18.Twenty-six per-cent had an urgent surgery. Mean extracorporeal circulation time was of 77±26 min and mean extubation time was 8±6 h.Eighty-four per cent had a coronary artery bybass grafting and 16% a valve replacement. Four per cent had a redux and 4% a combined surgery. Stay in surgical department varied between 3 and 10 days with average of 4.6±1.2 days. Early mortality rate was of 2% and 98% had complications. Ninety-eight complications occurred after surgery: 35 reintervention for mediastinal bleeding or tamponade, 28 bleedings requiring transfusions, eight heart rhythm disorders, an atrioventricular conduction block requiring ventricular, five atrial fibrillation, two ventricular tachycardias, a ventricular fibrillation, eight low cardiac outpout, seven prolonged mechanical ventilation and eight pneumonias. In univariate analysis, recent myocardial infarction and chronic kidney disease were predictive of early complications. Conclusion: Our data shows cardiac surgery is feasible in elderly patients with acceptable risk in terms of mortality and an increased morbidity due to their frailty. Careful patient selection is needed for the success of cardiac surgery in elderly patients.

N2  - Importance Patients on dialysis are often elderly and frail, with multiple comorbid conditions, and are heavy users of Emergency Department (ED) services. However, objective data on the frequency and pattern of ED utilization by dialysis patients are sparse. Such data could identify periods of highest risk for ED visits and inform health systems interventions to mitigate these risks and improve outcomes Objective To describe the pattern and frequency of presentation to ER by dialysis patients Design Retrospective cohort study using administrative data collected over ten years (2000–2009) in the Province of Manitoba, Canada. Setting Patients presenting to any of 9 ED’s in Winnipeg and Brandon Manitoba. These departments serve >90% of the population of Manitoba, Canada (population 1.2 million). Participants All patients presenting to an ED in any of 9 emergency departments in Manitoba, Canada. Exposure Dialysis status Main outcomes Presentation to the ED Results Over 2.1 million ED visits by more than 1.2 million non-dialysis patients and 17,782 ED visits by 3257 dialysis patients were included. Dialysis patients presented 8.5 times more frequently to the ED than the general population (age and sex adjusted, p<0.001). For dialysis patients, ED utilization was significantly higher following the long interdialytic interval (33.6% higher Mondays and 19.5% higher Tuesdays vs. other days of the week, p<0.001) and was 10-fold higher in the 7 days before and after the initiation of dialysis. Conclusion and relevance The heavy use of ED services by dialysis patients spikes upward following the long interdialytic interval and also in the week before and after dialysis initiation. The relative risks associated with these vulnerable periods were much higher than those reported for clinical patient characteristics. We propose that intrinsic gaps in the structure of care delivery (e.g. 3 times a week dialysis, imperfect surveillance and clinical monitoring of patients with low GFR) may be the fundamental drivers of this periodicity. Strategies to mitigate this excess health risk are needed.

N2  - The prevalence of end-stage renal disease is rising in the United States, which bears high financial and public health burden. The most common modality of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the United States is in-center hemodialysis. Many patients report lack of comprehensive and timely education about their treatment options, which may preclude them from participating in home-based dialysis therapies and kidney transplantation evaluation. While RRT education has traditionally been provided in-person, the rise of telehealth has afforded new opportunities to improve upon the status quo. For example, technology-augmented RRT education has recently been implemented into telehealth nephrology clinics, informational websites and mobile applications maintained by professional organizations, patient-driven forums on social media, and multimodality programs. The benefits of technology in RRT education are increased access for geographically isolated and/or medically frail patients, versatility of content delivery, information repetition to enhance knowledge retention, and interpersonal connection for educational content and emotional support. Challenges center around privacy and accuracy of information sharing, in addition to differential access to technology due to age and socioeconomic status. A review of available scholarly and social media resources suggests that technology-aided delivery of education about treatment options for end-stage renal disease provides an important alternative and/or supplemental resource for patients and families.

N2  - It is often of interest to compare centers or healthcare providers on quality of care delivered. We consider the setting where evaluation of center performance on multiple competing events is of interest. We propose estimating center effects through cause-specific proportional hazards frailty models that allow correlation among a center's cause-specific effects. Estimation of our model proceeds via penalized partial likelihood and is implemented in R. To evaluate center performance, we also propose a directly standardized excess cumulative incidence (ECI) measure. Therefore, based on our proposed methods, practitioners can evaluate centers either through the cause-specific hazards or the cumulative incidence functions. We demonstrate, through simulations, the advantages of the proposed methods to detect outlying centers, by comparing the proposed methods and existing methods which assume uncorrelated random center effects. In addition, we develop a Correlation Score Test to test the null hypothesis that the competing event processes within a center are correlated. Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we apply our method to evaluate the performance of Organ Procurement Organizations on two competing risks: (i) receipt of a kidney transplant and (ii) death on the wait-list.

N2  - Introduction: Ventricular septal rupture (VSR) occurs in 1-3% of non-reperfused transmural myocardial infarction (MI). We describe a case of VSR resulting from inferior transmural MI with fatal outcome. Case description: An 86-year-old frail woman is brought to the emergency department complaining about recurrent chest pain. She had chronic kidney disease and incipient dementia. She was disoriented, blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg, heart rate 55 bpm, SpO2 90% on room air, and respiratory rate was 20/min. Cardiac auscultation was remarkable for a systolic murmur and thrill along the left lower sternal border. ECG showed pathologic Q waves and ST-elevation in inferior and precordial leads (figure A). Bedside echocardiog-raphy revealed incomplete VSR (figure B), with back-and-forward shunt on colour Doppler imaging (figure C). In the cardiac catheterization laboratory, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) conterpulsation was initiated. Emergent coronary angiography depicted a dominant occluded right middle coronary artery, and severe ostial stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery. Surgical treatment was deemed futile owing to frailty and comorbidities. Severe hypotension and shock supervened, and frank left-to-right shunt across the defect was seen on Doppler imaging thereafter. The patient ultimately died from multiorgan dysfunction three days later. Discussion: VSR resulting from an inferior MI tends to be basally located and has a worse prognosis than those resulting from an anterior MI, which are associated with perforation of the apical septum. Our patient also had some risk features for VSR, such as advanced age, female sex, and chronic kidney disease. Immediate echocardiographic assessment is needed when VSR is suspected. Echocardiographic findings include direct visualization of VSR, left-to-right shunt on colour flow Doppler echocardiography through the ventricular septum, and pattern of right ventricle (RV) overload. In incomplete rupture, flow along the ruptured septum, without reaching the RV cavity, may be seen. For most patients with STEMI and VSR in circulatory col-lapse, IABP counterpulsation should be considered. Hypotension contraindicates institution of direct vasodilator therapy, such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside. Prompt surgical repair is necessary and involves closure of the defect, usually accompanied by coronary revasculariza-tion. VSR catheter-based repair may be appropriate in patients not candidates for early definitive surgical correction and without hemodynamically significant VSR, because complete closure of the defect requires time for the device to thrombose and endothelize. Conclusions: VSR should be suspected in every patient with acute transmural MI and hypotension. Immediate echocardiographic assessment is essential. IABP should be considered. Without repair, death due to biventricular failure rapidly ensues. In hemodynamically significant VSR, surgical management is the best management option.

N2  - Introduction & Objectives: In geriatric practice, the G8 screening tool represents a valid instrument for the identification of functional decline in oncological elderly patients (pts). Recently it has demonstrated good predictive value in surgery to identify fragile pts candidates for oncological abdominal surgery. Our study has the objective to define if G8 score is a good tool to identify the risk of post operative complications in elderly pts (≥ 70 years) undergoing radical cystectomy (RC). Materials & Methods: From January 2012 to August 2017 we recruited 56 pts 70 yrs or older at the surgical time (median age 76 yrs, SD 4.37), undergone RC. 41 pts were male (73.2%) and 15 pts female (26.8%). Median BMI was 25.73 (SD 4.03). 8 pts (14.3%) were affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus, 32 (57.1%) suffered hypertension and 18 (32.1 %) had stage III or higher chronic kidney disease. The G8 screening questionnaire was performed to all patients preoperatively, and fragile pts were identified with a score ≤ 14. We registered intra operative complications, post operative complications and their gravity using Clavien Dindo scale, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and its variation postoperatively, length of hospital stay after surgery and readmission rate within 30 days. We compared the clinical pathological data between the frail (G8 score <=14) and not frail (G8 score >14) group. Statistical analysis was made by computing software SPSS. Results: Median G8 score was 13.65 (SD 2.3). Pts were divided in fragile (N=35, 62.5%) and not fragile (N=21, 37.5%). Intra operative complications were registered in 1 pts (2.8 %) with G8 score ≤14 and 0 pt (0%) with G8>14 (p= 0.625). Post operative complications occurred in 24 pts (68.5 %) with G8 score ≤14 and 8 pts (38.09 %) with G8>14 (p=0.025), 12 and none of them had a Clavien Score ≥ 3 respectively (p= 0.015). Postoperative eGFR was 61.45 (SD 29.2) in G8≤14 group and 57.66 (SD 25.84) in G8>14 group (p=0.62) and median variation between pre and postoperative eGFR was 7.8 (SD 27.43) and 8.0 (SD 26.01) for each group (p= 0.97). Median hospital stay was 25.45 days (SD 11.01) for fragile pts and 24.23 days (SD 11.32) for fit pts (p=0.69). 5 pts (14.28 %) with G8 score≤14 were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, and for 6 pts (28.57 %) with G8 score>14 was necessary a new hospitalization (p= 0,298). No significative difference was registered for overall mortality (p= 0,23) and cancer related mortality (p= 0,53) between groups. Conclusions: The G8 screening tool represents a good predictive instrument for RC morbidity, identifying fragile pts at risk of post operative complications and their severity. However, it doesn't demonstrate good affability in identification of pts at risk of intraoperative complications and within 30 days of operation with necessity of hospital readmission. Further analyses are necessary to confirm the data obtained from this preliminary study.

N2  - Background: Older patients with frailty, a syndrome of decreased physiological reserve, are at risk for adverse outcomes. Physical activity can improve function in cardiovascular patients, but many are unable to attend cardiac rehab. Methods: The Get Going trial is an ongoing multicenter clinical trial of older patients meeting criteria on the FRAIL questionnaire with heart failure (HF) or coronary artery disease (CAD) randomized at hospital discharge to goal-oriented vs. monitor-only wearable actigraphy devices. Differences in baseline characteristics, short physical performance battery (SPPB; 0-12) and EuroQOL 5-D (0-5) were compared across diagnosis group. Results: Of 58 participants randomized (21 CAD; 37 HF), median age was 74, 75% male, with a mean SPPB score of 7.5 (±3.4). Patients with HF had more atrial fibrillation (p=0.01), pacemakers (p=0.04), chronic kidney disease (p=0.02), pulmonary hypertension (p=0.01), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.04), but there were no difference in baseline frailty, quality of life, SPPB scores or physical tests between groups (Table). Conclusion: Older adults hospitalized for CAD or HF had similar functional impairments, supporting inclusion of both for interventions aimed at improving post-discharge care. Ongoing follow up will inform the utility of actigraphy for improving function in these at risk patients.

N2  - Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the preferred therapy for patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. We have shown in patients considered at extreme risk of surgery 3-year rates of all-cause death of 50.3% and major stroke of 9.0%. Longer-term data are needed to understand valve durability and patient outcomes. Our objective was to determine the safety and efficacy of CoreValve TAVR at 5 years in patients at extreme risk for surgery. Methods: The CoreValve US Extreme Risk Pivotal Trial is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multicenter investigation of 489 patients who underwent iliofemoral CoreValve self-expanding TAVR at 41 centers. All patients were deemed to be extreme risk for surgery (> 50% 30-day mortality or irreversible morbidity) by a multidisciplinary Heart Team. CoreValve size selection was based on prospective CT analysis. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or major stroke rate at 1 year. A Clinical Events Committee adjudicated all major clinical events using VARC-1 criteria. Patients were followed through 5 years. Results: Patients were elderly (83.2±8.7 years), commonly women (52.1%) and were severely symptomatic (New York Heart Association class III or IV, 91.8%). The STS PROM was 10.3 ± 5.5%. Severe lung disease was present in 23.5%, 29.9% were on home oxygen, 13.0% had stage 4/5 chronic kidney disease and 58.7% had severe comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity index). Patients were frail with disabilities; 84.2% of patients had a 5-meter gait speed over 6 seconds, 67.1% had sub-threshold grip strength, 27.6% required assisted living and 20.9% had ≥ 2 Katz score defcits. The 5-year rate of all-cause mortality or major stroke was 71.7% (all-cause mortality, 71.6%; major stroke, 10.7%). Secondary outcomes, including rates of structural valve deterioration and bioprosthetic valve dysfunction, will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion: The CoreValve Extreme Risk Pivotal Trial evaluated 489 implanted patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis at extreme risk for surgery. These 5-year outcome data will define the late term safety and efficacy of the self-expanding CoreValve in this patient population.

N2  - Aims and Methods: Patients with diabetes receiving haemodial-ysis are frail and have multiple complex co-morbidities, which require input from multiple specialist teams. We suspected that many patients were missing essential diabetes and screening assessments due to difficulties attending and organising appointments around dialysis sessions. In order to improve the coordination of diabetes care, we piloted a mobile diabetes clinic at the bedside in the dialysis unit. Results: Our dialysis unit provides maintenance haemodialysis to 182 patients. Thirty-five per cent (n = 63) have diabetes. Fifty-one patients (mean age 67.5 years) were reviewed by the diabetes multidisciplinary team in the dialysis unit between May and September 2017. 90.2% (n = 46) had Type 2 diabetes. Mean HbA1c and duration of diabetes were 69.0mmol/mol and 19.7years respectively. 66.7% were treated with insulin. 51% had diabetic nephropathy (n = 26). 27.5% were not receiving regular diabetes review. The patients were frail and described difficulty travelling to appointments. 88.2% required assistance with transport and 72.5% used a mobility aid or wheelchair. Mortality during this period was 12.7%(n = 8). 37.3% of patients had not attended retinal screening in the previous year and we offered review appointments at a time and location of their choice. 17.6% had not received a foot check within the past year. 21.6% had active foot disease. We were able to arrange podiatry review for those not known to the service. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate a frail cohort with multiple complications who require specialist input from the diabetes multidisciplinary team. We responded to our patient's needs and initiated a mobile diabetes clinic, ensuring they had access to the specialist care they require.

N2  - Introduction & Objectives: While increasingly utilized, artial nephrectomy (PN) in the elderly is controversial due to several factors including advanced co-morbidities associated with decreasing life expectancy, and potential impact of procedure specific complications due to patient frailty. We aimed to evaluate the short-term outcomes of partial nephrectomy in patients over 75 years old using Trifecta as composite outcome of Surgical Quality. Materials & Methods: Multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with aged 75 years or older that underwent PN for renal mass. Primary outcome was achievement of trifecta [negative surgical margin, no urological complications, and ≥90% eGFR (glomerular filtration rate) recovery]. Secondary outcomes included overall survival, and progression to de novo chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III. Significance is determined by a two-sample t-test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Uni- and multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate risk factors associated with achieving trifecta and renal functional outcomes. Kaplan Meier analysis was used to calculate survival probability and freedom from new onset of CKD stage III. Results: Nine hundred and forty-nine patients (mean age 78.3 years, mean R.E.N.A.L. score 6.7, median follow-up 32 months) were analyzed. Of these patients 39.4% of them achieved trifecta. Patients with positive trifecta had lower preoperative eGFR (57.3 vs. 62.5), more proportion of clinical T1 disease (96.4% vs. 94.6%), had lower R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score (6.4 vs. 7.2) and had less estimated blood loss (204.2 ml vs. 328.4 ml) (p < 0.05). Rates of readmission in 30 days were 1.3% in positive trifecta group and 3.6% in negative trifecta group (p > 0.05). Low and moderate R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score [HR 6.8 and 4.8, 95% CI 1.54 - 30.64 and 1.08 - 21.67; p < 0.05, respectively], and minimal invasive surgery (MIS) [HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.02 - 2.82; p = 0.039] had higher ratios for the achievement of trifecta (Table). Increasing blood loss was inversely significant predictor [HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99 - 1.00, p = 0.034] for trifecta achievement. No difference was noted in overall survival among patients with T1a, ≥T1b and with and without positive trifecta (p > 0.05). Regression analysis showed that trifecta accomplishment [HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 - 0.39, p = 0.001] and MIS compared to open [HR 2.55, 95% CI 1.05 - 6.19, p = 0.037] were significant predictors of de novo CKD stage III. Conclusions: Partial nephrectomy in older patients is feasible with acceptable short-term morbidity and renal functional outcomes.

N2  - Background Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reflects a patient's disease burden, treatment effectiveness, and health status and is summarized by physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific scales among end-stage renal disease patients. Although on average HRQOL improves postkidney transplant (KT), the degree of change depends on the ability of the patient to withstand the stressor of dialysis versus the ability to tolerate the intense physiologic changes of KT. Frail KT recipients may be extra vulnerable to either of these stressors, thus affecting change in HRQOL after KT. Methods We ascertained frailty, as well as physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific HRQOL in a multicenter prospective cohort of 443 KT recipients (May 2014 to May 2017) using Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short Form. We quantified the short-Term (3 months) rate of post-KT HRQOL change by frailty status using adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models. Results Mean HRQOL scores at KT were 43.3 (SD, 9.6) for physical, 52.8 (SD, 8.9) for mental, and 72.6 (SD, 12.8) for kidney disease-specific HRQOL; frail recipients had worse physical (P < 0.001) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (P = 0.001), but similar mental HRQOL (P = 0.43). Frail recipients experienced significantly greater rates of improvement in physical HRQOL (frail, 1.35 points/month; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-2.05; nonfrail, 0.34 points/month; 95% CI,-0.17-0.85; P = 0.02) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (frail, 3.75 points/month; 95% CI, 2.89-4.60; nonfrail, 2.41 points/month; 95% CI, 1.78-3.04; P = 0.01), but no difference in mental HRQOL (frail, 0.54 points/month; 95% CI,-0.17-1.25; nonfrail, 0.46 points/month; 95% CI,-0.06-0.98; P = 0.85) post-KT. Conclusions Despite decreased physiologic reserve, frail recipients experience improvement in post-KT physical and kidney disease-specific HRQOL better than nonfrail recipients.

N2  - Aim: To evaluate the relationship between kidney function without diabetes and components of the frailty phenotype in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Methods: Participants were 8343 residents who completed baseline assessments, classified into four categories according to eGFR. Frailty status was defined using five criteria: (i) slow gait speed; (ii) muscle weakness; (iii) low physical activity; (iv) exhaustion; and (v) unintentional weight loss. Results: After multivariate adjustment, participants with the lowest kidney function were at higher risk of frailty (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02–3.50) than those with normal kidney function. In addition, after adjustment for multiple confounders, estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 was associated with a greater risk of the individual frailty components of weight loss (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.11–4.12), low physical activity (OR 1.35, 95% CI, 1.01–2.54) and slowness (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.36–3.77) compared with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60. Conclusions: Lower kidney function was associated with a higher risk of weight loss, low physical activity and slowness among community-dwelling Japanese older adults.

N2  - Objectives •Describe three complex dialysis decisions for kidney disease patients including conservative care, trial of dialysis and dialysis discontinuation. •Demonstrate communication approaches between palliative care and nephrology clinicians. Foster collaboration on complex cases using role play demonstrations. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly common in the aging population, and the highest incidence of patients starting dialysis is those 75 years of age and older. Patients over the age of 67 face mortality rates as high as 23% at 6 months, though there exists great variability. Older patients with advanced CKD are more likely to have comorbidities including cognitive and functional limitations. Symptom burden is high and does not consistently improve, and may worsen, after starting dialysis. This cluster of factors complicates decision-making as uncertainty often exists as to whether the benefits outweigh the risks of starting, stopping or continuing dialysis. As palliative care becomes part of routine nephrology care, palliative care clinicians will work closely with nephrology clinicians to address these complex decisions, and care for this frail population. Many nephrology clinicians do not feel prepared to have conversations about forgoing dialysis and worry that discussing withdrawal from dialysis may cause their patients to lose hope. Many patients express regret over starting dialysis, but may worry that stopping dialysis will disappoint their family or nephrology provider. Opportunities exist for palliative care clinicians to partner with nephrology clinicians and patients to navigate these difficult discussions and decisions. To best facilitate this, palliative care clinicians need to better understand the nuanced perspectives of their nephrology colleagues. By improving this understanding, palliative care and nephrology clinicians can communicate effectively to better support patients. In this Kidney SIG sponsored session, an interdisciplinary team including palliative care nephrology clinicians will present cases to demonstrate the complexity of decisions for older patients with kidney disease. Nephrology-specific decision tools will be applied to the cases to show their benefit in managing advanced kidney disease. Communication skills to enhance collaboration between palliative care and nephrology will be demonstrated through roleplay.

N2  - Background: Although individuals classified as nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, are entitled to receive emergency dialysis in the United States regardless of their ability to pay, most states do not provide them with subsidized care for maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation. We explored whether nonresident aliens have similar outcomes to US citizens after receiving kidney transplants covered by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program. Study Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting & Participants: All adult Medicaid patients in the US Renal Data System who received their first kidney transplant from 1990 to 2011. Predictor: Citizenship status, categorized as US citizen, nonresident alien, or permanent resident. Outcome: All-cause transplant loss. Measurements: HRs and 95% CIs estimated by applying Cox proportional hazards frailty models with transplantation center as a random effect. Results: Of 10,495 patients, 8,660 (82%) were US citizens, 1,489 (14%) were permanent residents, and 346 (3%) were nonresident aliens, whom we assumed were undocumented immigrants. Nonresident aliens were younger, healthier, receiving dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a living donor. 71% underwent transplantation in California, and 61% underwent transplantation after 2005. Nonresident aliens had a lower unadjusted risk for transplant loss compared with US citizens (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still significant when adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, dialysis, and transplant-related factors (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94). Limitations: Citizenship status was self-reported, possible residual confounding. Conclusions: Our study suggests that the select group of insured nonresident aliens who undergo transplantation with Medicaid do just as well as US citizens with Medicaid. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for kidney transplantation in nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, given the associated high-quality outcomes in these patients.

N2  - Objective: Sarcopenia measured by decreased psoas muscle size has been used as a surrogate for frailty and correlates with adverse outcomes in both the short and long term after many major operations. Our aim was to evaluate this measure as a predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Methods: Once Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, all patients who underwent EVAR from December 2010 to March 2016 at a Veterans Affairs hospital were assessed for sarcopenia by total psoas muscle area (TPA) measured on axial computed tomography scan immediately inferior to the fourth lumbar (L4) superior end plate. Outcomes including length of stay and mortality were collected from the medical record. Results: There were 135 patients who underwent EVAR at a median age of 70 years. Median aneurysm size was 5.5 cm. Length of stay was >2 days in 25% of patients (n = 33), with the most common reasons for delayed discharge including respiratory complications (8.9% [n = 12]) and urinary retention (4.0% [n = 9]). Low TPA was not associated with extended length of stay (P =.40). Patients with lowest tertile TPA had 42% 5-year survival compared with 93% survival observed for the remaining two-thirds of patients (P =.01). Multivariate analysis revealed increased likelihood of mortality at 5 years for patients in the lowest tertile for TPA (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.9) as well as for patients with chronic kidney disease (odds ratio, 5.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-18.0). Conclusions: Preoperative sarcopenia does not appear to affect length of stay but does portend worse long-term survival. This simple preoperative measurement may help vascular surgeons tailor repair thresholds and avoid nonbeneficial procedures.

N2  - Frailty is significantly associated with bone loss in the general population. However, it is unclear whether this association also exists in patients undergoing hemodialysis who have chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). This study aimed to assess the association between frailty and bone loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This cross-sectional study included 214 (90 women, 124 men) Japanese outpatients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis three times per week, with a mean age of 67.1 years (women) and 66.8 years (men). Frailty was defined based on criteria set forth by the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS)—19 (21.1%) women and 47 (37.9%) men were robust, 41 (45.6%) women and 43 (34.7%) men were pre-frail, and 30 (33.3%) women and 34 (27.4%) men were frail. For bone mass, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters (speed of sound, broadband ultrasound attenuation, stiffness index) of the calcaneus were measured. The association between frailty and QUS parameters was determined separately for women and men using multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with adjustments for clinical characteristics including age, body mass index, hemodialysis vintage, diabetes, current smoking, serum albumin, phosphate, corrected calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, and medication for CKD-MBD (vitamin D receptor activator, calcimimetics). ANCOVA revealed that all QUS parameters declined significantly with increasing levels of frailty in both sexes (P < 0.05). In conclusion, frailty (as defined by CHS criteria) should be considered a risk factor for bone loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

N2  - Background: The Fried frailty phenotype, a measure of physiologic reserve defined by 5 components (exhaustion, unintentional weight loss, low physical activity, slow walking speed, and poor grip strength), is associated with poor outcomes among ESRD patients. However, these 5 components may not fully capture physiologic reserve in this population. We aimed to ascertain opinions of ESRD clinicians and patients about the usefulness of the Fried frailty phenotype and interventions to improve frailty in ESRD patients, and to identify novel components to further characterize frailty in ESRD. Methods: Clinicians who treat adults with ESRD completed a 2-round Delphi study (n = 41 and n = 36, respectively; response rate = 87%). ESRD patients completed a survey at transplant evaluation (n = 460; response rate = 81%). We compared clinician and patient opinions on the constituent components of frailty. Results: Clinicians were more likely than patients to say that ESRD makes patients frail (97.6% vs. 60.2%). There was consensus among clinicians that exhaustion, low physical activity, slow walking speed, and poor grip strength characterize frailty in ESRD patients; however, 29% of clinicians thought weight loss was not relevant. Patients were less likely than clinicians to say that the 5 Fried frailty components were relevant. Clinicians identified 10 new ESRD-specific potential components including falls (64%), physical decline (61%), and cognitive impairment (39%). Clinicians (83%) and patients (80%) agreed that intradialytic foot-peddlers might make ESRD patients less frail. Conclusions: There was consensus among clinicians and moderate consensus among patients that frailty is more common in ESRD. Weight loss was not seen as relevant, but new components were identified. These findings are first steps in refining the frailty phenotype and identifying interventions to improve physiologic reserve specific to ESRD patients.

N2  - Background/Aims: Frail patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased hospitalisation and mortality rate. However, many popular frailty screening methods have not been validated in patients with CKD. This study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of several frailty screening methods in patients with CKD G4-5 and those established on haemodialysis (G5D). Methods: Ninety participants with CKD G4-5D were recruited from Nephrology Outpatient Clinics and 2 Haemodialysis Units between December 2016 and December 2017. Frailty was diagnosed using the Fried Frailty Phenotype. The following frailty screening tests were evaluated: Clinical Frailty Scale, PRISMA-7, CKD Frailty Index, CKD FI-LAB, walking speed, hand grip strength and Short Physical Performance Battery. Results: The mean age of participants was 69 years (SD ±13). One-third of participants were dialysis-dependent. Nineteen (21%) patients were categorised as frail, 42 (47%) as pre-frail and 29 (32%) as robust. Overall, walking speed was the most discriminative measure (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.93-1.00], sensitivity 0.84 [95% CI 0.62-0.94], specificity 0.96 [95% CI 0.88-0.99]). The Clinical Frailty Scale had the best performance of the non-physical assessment frailty screening methods (AUC 0.90 [95% CI 0.84-0.97], sensitivity 0.79 [95% CI 0.57-0.91], specificity 0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.93]). Conclusions: Walking speed can be used to accurately screen for frailty in CKD populations. If it is not practical to perform a physical assessment to screen for frailty, the Clinical Frailty Scale is a useful alternative.

N2  - Depressive symptoms and physical frailty are both prevalent and associated with mortality in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. Given the differential impact of depressive symptoms on mortality among frail community-dwelling older adults, we hypothesize that depressive symptoms and frailty contribute a synergistic effect on adverse outcomes among KT recipients. Methods: In a multi-center study of 763 adult KT recipients, we measured frailty using the 5-component Fried Frailty Phenotype and depressive symptoms using a modified 18-question Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, with a score of >14 indicating depressive symptoms. Frailty was assessed on a 0-5 scale, with scores >2 considered frail. Using adjusted survival analysis and Poisson regression, we tested whether depressive symptoms and frailty were associated with mortality, death-censored graft failure, and a longer length of hospital stay (LOS). Results: Among KT recipients, 10.1% exhibited depressive symptoms and 16.5% were frail. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with frailty (OR=6.58, 95% CI: 3.53-12.28, p<0.001). Frail KT recipients exhibiting depressive symptoms were at a higher risk of graft failure and a longer LOS than their non-frail and not depressed counterparts (Table 1). Conclusion: Depressive symptoms are more likely to be present in adult ESRD patients who are frail. Together, depressive symptoms and frailty contribute to a higher risk of graft failure and a longer LOS. KT recipients who are both depressed and frail should be closely monitored in order to improve outcomes post-KT.

N2  - Background: Kidney transplantation (KT) candidates often present with multiple comorbidities. These patients also have a substantial burden of frailty, which is also associated with increased mortality. However, it is unknown if frailty is merely a surrogate for comorbidity, itself an independent domain of risk, or if frailty and comorbidity have differential effects. Better understanding the interplay between these 2 constructs will improve clinical decision making in KT candidates. Objective: To test whether comorbidity is equally associated with waitlist mortality among frail and nonfrail KT candidates and to test whether measuring both comorbidity burden and frailty improves mortality risk prediction. Methods: We studied 2,086 candidates on the KT waitlist (November 2009 - October 2017) in a multicenter cohort study, in whom frailty and comorbidity were measured at evaluation. We quantified the association between Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) adapted for end-stage renal disease and waitlist mortality using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model and tested whether this association differed between frail and nonfrail candidates. Results: At evaluation, 18.1% of KT candidates were frail and 51% had a high comorbidity burden (CCI score ≥2). Candidates with a high comorbidity burden were at 1.38-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.89) increased risk of waitlist mortality. However, this association differed by frailty status (p for interaction = 0.01): among nonfrail candidates, a high comorbidity burden was associated with a 1.66-fold (95% CI 1.17-2.35) increased mortality risk; among frail candidates, here was no statistically significant association (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.44-1.29). Adding this interaction between comorbidity and frailty to a mortality risk estimation model significantly improved prediction, increasing the c-statistic from 0.640 to 0.656 (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Nonfrail candidates with a high comorbidity burden at KT evaluation have an increased risk of waitlist mortality. Importantly, comorbidity is less of a concern in already high-risk patients who are frail.

N2  - Background: Hospitalizations in patients are the major cause of morbidity and healthcare expenditure in patients with cirrhosis. Predictive factors determining which outpatients with cirrhosis are at highest risk for unplanned admissions are lacking. We aimed to study factors predicting unplanned hospitalization or death at 3 months & study utility of Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) in outpatients with cirrhosis. Method: This was a Prospective observational study of consecutive outpatients with cirrhosis in a single tertiary care centre in Kerala. Patients with active malignancy, ESRD & any condition requiring immediate admission were excluded. Frailty was defined as CFS[4. Unplanned hospitalization was defined as any admission to acute care hospital that was not planned. Data on socioeconomic status, MELD, CHILD & Charlson comorbidity index were recorded. The outcome was defined as unplanned hospitalization or/and death at 1 and 3 months. Variables were analyzed by Binary logistic regression. Result: Overall 124 patients included, 52(41.9%) were frail, Etiology was predominantly alcohol 63/124 (51%) followed by HBV 30/124 (24%) then NASH 12/124 (16.7%) related cirrhosis. Mean MELD was 20 and CTP score was 10.6 in frail patients.CFS mean value was 5.2 with CRP mean of 3.2 mg/dl in frail outpatients. 26/52 (50%) of frail patients as compared to 2/72 (2.8%) non-frail patients had unplanned hospitalization at 1 month whereas 44/52 (84.6%) as compared to 11/72(15.3%) had unplanned hospitalization at 3 months. 9/52 (17.3%) frail patients died in comparison to only 1/72 (1.46%) in the non-Frail group at 3 months. On Univariate regression analysis variables found to have p values\0.05 were considered for Multi-variate Cox regression analysis. Multivariate Binary logistic regression (Backward LR) patients taking B-blocker more than 20 mg with p < 0.07, OR 7.16 (CI 1.73-29.6), Frail patients with CFS[4 p < 0.01, OR: 5.38 (CI: 1.3-21.6), Presence of AKI with p < 0.006, OR: 17.24 (CI: 2.2-133.7), CRP[2mg/dl with p < 0.001, OR: 11.23 (CI: 2.6-47) were found to independently predict unplanned admission at 1 month and unplanned admission/death at 3 months. We also observed that CRP with a cut-off of 2mg/dl with Sensitivity of 77.5% and specificity of 92.42% with AUC of 0.88 predicted unplanned hospitalization/death at 3 months. Conclusion: Clinical frailty scale greater than 4 as rapid 1-minute screen predicts unplanned hospitalization and death at 1 & 3 months and can be utilized in outpatients with cirrhosis for stratifying patients at risk of adverse outcomes.

N2  - Conglomeration of adverse factors, primarily the additive effect of the chronological and pathological aging along with polymorbidity increases the prevalence of patients with frailty phenotype in pre-dialyse and dialyse care. In end stage renal failure patients with a high index comorbidity and frailty it is necessary to consider the benefit and the burden of renal replacement therapy and to individualize the approach to patients with regard to the social and legislative aspects of the problem. Assisted peritoneal dialysis could be the solution for polymorbid frailty patients with a short life prognosis. Newly according to the literary sources show as an alternative solution the “dialysis for the test” and “non-aggressive nephrological care”. Comprehensive integrated care as the interconnection and the sharing of responsibility and resources is a solution for very difficult polymorbid patients. It requires the interconnection of health and social policies, which in the Czech Republic has not been resolved.

N2  - A significant interaction between kidneys and lungs has been shown in physiological and pathological conditions. The two organs can both be targets of the same systemic disease (eg., some vasculitides). Moreover, loss of normal function of either of them can induce direct and indirect dysregulation of the other one. Subjects suffering from COPD may have systemic inflammation, hypoxemia, endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic activation and increased aortic stiffness. As well as the exposure to nicotine, all the foresaid factors can induce a microvascular damage, albuminuria, and a worsening of renal function. Renal failure in COPD can be unrecognized since elderly and frail patients may have normal serum creatinine concentration. Lungs and kidneys participate in maintaining the acid-base balance. Compensatory role of the lungs rapidly expresses through an increase or reduction of ventilation. Renal compensation usually requires a few days as it is achieved through changes in bicarbonate reabsorption. Chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal diseases increase the risk of pneumonia. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumonia and seasonal influenza is recommended for these patients. Vaccines against the last very virulent H1N1 influenza A strain are also available and effective. Acute lung injury and acute kidney injury are frequent complications in critical illnesses, associated with high morbidity and mortality. The concomitant failure of kidneys and lungs implies a multidisciplinary approach, both in terms of diagnostic processes and therapeutic management.

N2  - Objectives: Frailty can cause increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, such as falls, fractures, depression and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition, HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5). Methods: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale); depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools. Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights >136 kg, and coinciding comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded. Results: Frailty occurred in 17% of participants (n=7). Frail participants had lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more depression (p=<0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p<0.05). No differences in health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail participants (p>0.05). Conclusions: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.

N2  - Objective: Chronic kidney disease is strongly associated with Poor Locomotor Function (PLF) and sarcopenia. However, few studies have evaluated them after Kidney Transplantation (KT). The main objective of this study was to define the prevalence of PLF 3 months after successful KT. Patients and Methods: Since February 2016, locomotor and cognitive tests are routinely performed for all KT recipients in the KT unit. The 5-repeat-sit-tostand test (5STS), Timed Up and Go test, walking speed, unipedal stance time with opened and closed eyes, handgrip strength and Frailty index are performed 3 months after KT. We defined PLF if at least 2 tests out of 6 deviated of more than 2SD or 10 percentile from the expected age-specific mean in the same population matched for age and sex (LOCNORM study established French norms). Results: Over a one-year period (February 2016 to February 2017), tests were analysed on 133 KT recipients (aged 20-81 years). 65% of patients had PLF, 25% had 1 pathological test and only 10% had normal locomotor function. 29% of patients had more than 4 pathological locomotor tests and then were considered with High PLF (HPLF). Finally, 100% of the patients diagnosed as frail had one or more deficient locomotor tests. Time on dialysis before KT was associated with PLF (p < 0.04). 5STS added to walking speed found 87% of HPLF. This association might be appropriate to quickly detect deficient patients. Conclusion: A majority of patients have poor locomotor function independently of age. This functional limitation is under estimated and associated with frequent falls, higher mortality and poor quality of life. Screening before and after KT must be developed especially in young patients, in order to propose personalized rehabilitation programs after KT as in other solid organ transplantation.

N2  - Inflammation is associated with poor physical performance, frailty, and death in older adults. Given the elevated inflammation among ESRD patients, it is likely that inflammatory markers are associated with adverse outcomes such as frailty or physical limitation among kidney transplantation (KT) candidates. Methods: 974 participants were enrolled at the time of KT evaluation (4/2014 to 5/2017). Inflammatory markers, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and frailty were assessed at the time of KT evaluation. Participants with a SPPB score <10 were classified as SPPB impaired. Elevated inflammation markers were defined as >1SD higher level of IL-6, sTNFR1, CRP or inflammation index in log scale. Results: Dialysis groups had higher inflammation; HD patients were most likely to be SPPB impaired and frail (Table 1). Overall, the odds of being frail or SPPB impaired at the time of KT evaluation were higher with increasing IL-6, CRP, and inflammation index, while the odds of being SPPB impaired were also higher with increasing sTNFR1 (Table 2). Among HD patients, the odds of being frail at the time of KT evaluation were higher with increasing IL-6 and CRP and the odds of being SPPB impaired were higher with increasing IL-6, CRP, and inflammation index (Table 2). Conclusion: KT candidates undergoing HD have higher odds of being frail and SPPB impaired with elevated inflammation. HD patients with elevated IL-6, CRP, and inflammation index, may need closer follow up or prehabilitation to improve physical function and reduce frailty burden.

N2  - Learning Objective #1: Recognize cefepime-induced neurotoxicity and its risk factors Learning Objective #2: Manage cefepime-induced neurotoxicity CASE: A 58-year-old female presented with back pain, cough, fever, chills, and diaphoresis. She was febrile and cachectic. Urinalysis suggested an infection and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were higher than baseline. CTscan revealed multifocal pneumonia and pyelonephritis. Vancomycin and cefepime (2 grams every 24 hours) were started on hospital day (HD) 1. On HD4, cultures grew Enterobacter cloacae in blood and Providencia rettgeri and Escheria coli in the urine. Vancomycin was discontinued and cefepime frequency was increased to 2 grams every 12 hours. Over the following 2 days, the patient exhibited increasing confusion, progressing to inability to follow commands, asterixis, and generalized myoclonic jerks. On HD5, cefepime trough was 100.68 mcg/ml. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was interpreted as ictal-interictal spectrum with sharply contoured frontal rhythmic delta activity and triphasic morphology. Cefepime was stopped on HD6. The patient's mental status started to improve on HD7 and returned completely to baseline on HD8. IMPACT: Unfortunately, as in our case, the diagnosis of cefepime-induced neurotoxicity can be delayed especially in sick, frail patients with impaired renal function, because the neurotoxic symptoms can be subtle, gradual in onset, and attributed to other causes. In our case, the EEG findings, cefepime trough, and timeline of events suggested the diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of consideration and diagnosis of cefepime-induced neurotoxicity to prevent delay in timely, and potentially life-saving, treatment of these patients. DISCUSSION: Cefepime, a broad-spectrum intravenous fourth-generation cephalosporin, is eliminated mainly by glomerular filtration. Since its marketing in 1994, there have been reports of neurological side effects including confusion, myoclonus, somnolence, coma, encephalopathy, and seizures. Risk factors for neurotoxicity include age, frailty, and chronic kidney disease. The mechanism is likely related to competitive antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the brain's principal inhibitory neurotransmitter. EEG typically shows triphasic waves that deteriorate to non-convulsive status epilepticus and in rare cases, convulsive status epilepticus. Cefepime troughs can be helpful diagnostically, as a level > 22 mcg/ml has been associated with a 50% neurotoxic rate. To prevent cefepime-induced neurotoxicity, the dose of the drug should be adjusted based on body weight and renal function. Treatment of neurotoxicity has been mainly supportive. Many reported cases have resolved by discontinuation of cefepime, similar to our case. If needed, benzodiazepines are effective anticonvulsants because of GABA enhancement. Cefepime is dialyzable and hemodialysis has been reported in a few cases. The prognosis ranges from full recovery to death, with early diagnosis as better prognostic factor.

N2  - Frailty is common in kidney transplant (KT) recipients, and associated with post-KT adverse events. In geriatrics populations, frail adults exhibit elevated levels of inflammation. In this study, we quantified the association between inflammation, frailty, and post-KT outcomes among KT recipients. 370 participants were enrolled in a prospective cohort at the time of KT (10/2009-3/2017). Frailty status and inflammation makers were measured immediately prior to KT. Elevated inflammation level was defined as 1 SD increase in the log scale of IL-6, sTNFR1, or HSCRP measurements as well as an inflammatory index calculated using IL-6 and sTNFR1. Among KT recipients, 14.9% were frail and 27.3% were intermediately frail. Elevated serum IL-6 was associated with intermediate frailty (OR=1.97) and frailty (OR=3.14); a higher inflammatory index was associated with frailty (OR=2.32) (Table 1). Elevated level of IL-6 were associated with a higher DGF (OR=1.49); elevated serum sTNFR1 was associated with higher DGF (OR=1.68) and higher death-censored graft loss (HR=3.44); and higher inflammatory index was associated with mortality (HR=2.38), DGF (OR=1.70) and longer length of hospital stay (RR=1.10) (Table 2). Elevated level of IL-6 is associated with frailty as well as DGF. Higher level of sTNFR1 was associated with death-censored graft loss and DGF. When integrating the two measurements as a more comprehensive index, it was associated with both frailty and post-KT outcomes such as mortality, DGF and length of stay. Measurement of inflammatory markers prior to KT may be an objective tool for post-KT risk stratification.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of frailty and the association of vitamin D levels and the frailty phenotype among non-geriatric dialysis patients.
METHOD: Seventy-four stable, chronic hemodialysis patients from the hemodialysis unit of the hospital were enrolled in the study. The patients' medical histories and laboratory findings were obtained from the medical records of the dialysis unit. Serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were determined using chemiluminometric immunoassays. Frailty was defined by Fried et al. as a phenotype; shrinking, weakness, self-reported exhaustion, decreased activity and slowed walking speed were evaluated.
RESULTS: Forty-one (55%) of the patients were males. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to frailty scores: 39 (53%) patients were frail, 6 (8%) patients were intermediately frail, and 28 (39%) patients were normal. Significant differences were found for 25-hydroxy vitamin D and hemoglobin levels among the groups; however, no differences were observed in body mass index, comorbidities, sex, marital status, education, disease and dialysis durations, or parathyroid hormone, creatinine, serum calcium, phosphorus, and potassium levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Weakness and slowness are serious outcomes of both vitamin D deficiency and frailty, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risks of decreased physical activity, falls, fractures and death in postmenopausal women and older men. Although studies on frailty have focused on older adults, growing evidence indicates that the frailty phenotype is becoming a factor associated with poor health outcomes in non-geriatric populations with chronic disease.

N2  - Background Frailty has been increasingly used as a prognostic indicator for various surgical operations. Patients with peripheral arterial disease represent a cohort of population with advanced medical comorbidities. The aim of this study is to correlate the postoperative outcomes after lower extremity bypass surgery with preoperative modified frailty index (mFI). Methods Using 2010 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial bypass surgery were identified. mFI with 11 variables, based on the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index, was utilized. Based on mFI score, the patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 (mFI score: 0–0.09), group 2 (mFI score: 0.18–0.27), group 3 (mFI score: 0.36–0.45), and group 4 (mFI score: 0.54–0.63). A bivariate and multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 4,704 patients (64% males and 36% females) underwent infrainguinal arterial bypass. Mean age was 67.9 ± 11.7 years. Distribution of patients based on mFI was as follows: group 1: 14.6%, group 2: 55.9%, group 3: 26.9%, and group 4: 2.6%. Increase in mFI was associated with higher mortality rates. Incidence of mortality for group 1 was 0.6%; for group 2, it was 1.4%; for group 3, it was 4%; and for group 4, it was 7.4%. Likewise, the incidence of other postoperative complications such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, progressive renal failure, and graft failure was significantly high among patients with high mFI scores. Following factors were associated with increased risk of mortality: high mFI score, black race, dialysis dependency, postoperative renal insufficiency, MI, and postoperative acute renal failure. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the mFI can be used as a valuable tool to identify patients at a higher risk for developing postoperative complications after lower extremity revascularization. For patients with mFI score of 0.54–0.63, the risk of mortality and complications increases significantly. mFI can be used as a useful screening tool to identify patients who are at a high risk for developing complications.

N2  - Prediction models for post-kidney transplantation mortality have had limited success (C-statistics ≤0.70). Adding objective measures of potentially modifiable factors may improve prediction and, consequently, kidney transplant (KT) survival through intervention. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is an easily administered objective test of lower extremity function consisting of three parts (balance, walking speed, chair stands), each with scores of 0–4, for a composite score of 0–12, with higher scores indicating better function. SPPB performance and frailty (Fried frailty phenotype) were assessed at admission for KT in a prospective cohort of 719 KT recipients at Johns Hopkins Hospital (8/2009 to 6/2016) and University of Michigan (2/2013 to 12/2016). The independent associations between SPPB impairment (SPPB composite score ≤10) and composite score with post-KT mortality were tested using adjusted competing risks models treating graft failure as a competing risk. The 5-year posttransplantation mortality for impaired recipients was 20.6% compared to 4.5% for unimpaired recipients (p < 0.001). Impaired recipients had a 2.30-fold (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12–4.74, p = 0.02) increased risk of postkidney transplantation mortality compared to unimpaired recipients. Each one-point decrease in SPPB score was independently associated with a 1.19-fold (95% CI 1.09–1.30, p < 0.001) higher risk of post-KT mortality. SPPB-derived lower extremity function is a potentially highly useful and modifiable objective measure for pre-KT risk prediction.

N2  - Objectives: Antiresorptive treatment is a cornerstone of secondary prevention of fragility fractures; oral bisphosphonates (BPs) being the mainstay of treatment in Singapore. This study aims to provide insight into factors influencing the initiation of oral antiresorptive therapy after surgical repair of hip fracture in the elderly. Methods: 296 patients aged ≥65 admitted consecutively to a rehabilitation unit postsurgical fixation of hip fracture were included in this prospective study; as part of a comprehensive hip fracture programme integrating best practices for peri-operative care, rehabilitation and a fracture liaison service. In this protocol, calcium, vitamin D supplements and oral BP treatment were initiated within 28 days of surgery by doctors, aided by osteoporosis nurse counselling. Reasons for noninitiation of oral BPs were recorded, triggering referral to the specialist clinic for parenteral antiresorptives. Logistic regression was performed to examine factors associated with noninitiation of oral BPs, adjusting for age and gender. Results: Themean age of subjects was 80.1±8.3;median creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 46.1 ml/min (IQR 34.3-59.8). 64.2% were not started on oral BPs; they tended to be older, have non-weight bearing (NWB) status, lower premorbid new mobility score (NMS) and lower CrCl (all p<0.05). Log-transformed NWBstatus and log-transformed CrCl were significantly associated with noninitiation of oral BPs in the multivariable model: odds ratio 4.49 (95%CI 1.69-11.95; p=0.003); 0.06 (95%CI 0.02-0.16; p<0.001), respectively. This was consistent with most common recorded reasons for noninitiation: chronic kidney disease (CKD; 43.7%), NWB status (18.8%), patient refusal (11.6%) and gastro-oesophageal disease (9.4%). Conclusions: CKD is common in the elderly with hip fracture, thus affecting secondary prevention, as evidence for safety and efficacy of BPs is marginal in advanced CKD. NWB status could reflect poor bone quality; with implications on fracture healing if given BPs. Patients with poor premorbid functional status (NMS) are likely more frail, with complex comorbidities. The results provide insight into the limitations and challenges of commencing oral BPs in this elderly hip fracture cohort and gives impetus to further address the osteoporosis care gap.

N2  - Despite substantial improvements following the introduction of novel agents and antibodies, amyloid light-chain (AL)-amyloidosis still carries a grim prognosis. Here, we report on the case of a severely frail 86-year-old patient suffering from monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS)-associated AL-amyloidosis with a diuretic-refractory nephrotic syndrome. In this patient, treatment with bortezomib–dexamethasone effectively induced a serological response, but was unfortunately poorly tolerated and failed to promote renal recovery fast enough to prevent secondary complications. Facing ongoing nephrotic syndrome, we performed unilateral kidney embolization and observed a substantial improvement of hypoalbuminemia accompanied by a significant gain in overall quality of life despite the necessity for thrice weekly dialysis. It can be concluded that systemic drugs in MGRS typically do not lead to instantaneous organ recovery but may initially rather be associated with substantial treatment-related morbidity. In this setting, unilateral renal artery embolization is effective to treat nephrotic syndrome and its secondary complications. The risk of potentially adverse effects, including post-embolization syndrome, can be minimized by unilateral embolization, still noting that also one-sided renal ablation has to be balanced against the requirement for life-long renal replacement therapy. Prospective controlled trials in a more comprehensive cohort will be needed to estimate the overall benefit of kidney embolization relative to novel agent therapies in frail patients with MGRS-related AL-amyloidosis.

N2  - Fixed-dose triple drug combinations represent one of the latest innovations of pharmacotherapy for hypertension (HT). They combine a traditional renin-angiotensin system blocker, a diuretic and a calcium channel blocker. The main benefit is the simplification of treatment regimen because 3 different agents are combined at different doses in a single pill. Improving adherence to treatment partly explains why this kind of combination may effectively reduce blood pressure (BP). BP lowering by a sin-gle-pill triple-drug combination can be approximately predicted, by using appropriate formulas described in previous meta-analysis of randomized trials. Thus, clinicians may select the appropriate dose for each of the combined drugs. Selection of different types of fixed-dose triple-drug combinations relies upon clinical experience, commercial availability and evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses for each agent alone. However, triple fixed-dose drug combinations should be reserved only for patients with uncontrolled BP with 2 agents, poor adherence in complex therapeutic regimens or on inappropriate free-drug combinations. Also, triple therapy may help overcome clinical inertia by prescribing more potent antihypertensive formulations in one pill. In contrast, this type of multiple-drug fixed-dose combination might be less safe in very old and frail patients, as well as in those with chronic kidney disease. Although new combinations may help overcome the clinical inertia of achieving individualized BP targets, doctors should also pay attention reinforcement of lifestyle changes.

N2  - Background: Aim of our study is to describe, in people with CKD, the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes with increasing age. The prevalence of CKD in Western populations, where longevity is the norm, is about 10-15%, but how age influence different characteristics of patients with CKD is largely not known. Methods: One thousand two hundred sixty-five patients enrolled in the CKD.QLD registry at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital were grouped according to age at consent i.e. <35, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+ years age groups, and were followed till start of renal replacement therapy (RRT), death, discharge or the censor date of September 2015. Results: Age ranged from 17.6 to 98.5 years with medians of 70.1 and 69.9 years for males and females respectively: 7% were <35 years of age, with the majority (63%) >65 years old. The leading renal diagnoses changed from genetic real disease (GRD) and glomerulonephritis (GN) in the younger patients to renovascular disease (RVD) and hypertension (HTN) in older patients. With increasing age, there were often multiple renal disease diagnoses, more advanced stages of CKD, greater number of comorbidities, more frequent and more costly hospitalizations, and higher death rates. The rates of initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) rose from 4.5 per 100 person years in those age < 35 years to a maximum of 5.5 per 100 person years in 45-54 years age group and were lowest, at 0.5 per 100 person years in those >85 years. Mortality rates increased by age group from 1.3 to 17.0 per 100 person years in 35-44 year and 85+ year age groups respectively. Rates of hospitalization, length of stay and cost progressively increased from the youngest to eldest groups. Patients with diabetic nephropathy had highest incidence rate of RRT and death. The proportion of patients who lost more than 5mls/min/1.73m2 of eGFR during at least 12 months follow up increased from 13.3% in the youngest age group to 29.2% in the eldest. Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive view, with no exclusions, of CKD patients seen in a public renal specialty referral practice, in Australia. The age distribution of patients encompasses the whole of adult life, with a broader range and higher median value than patients receiving RRT. Health status ranged from a single system (renal) disease in young adults through, with advancing age, renal impairment as a component of, or accompanying multisystem diseases, to demands and complexities of support of frail or elderly people approaching end of life. This great spectrum demands a broad understanding and capacity of renal health care providers, and dictates a need for a wider scope of health services provision incorporating multiple models of care.

N2  - METHODS: Patients with ESRD were prospectively enrolled, with clinical features and laboratory data recorded. The severity of frailty among these patients with ESRD was ascertained using the previously validated simple FRAIL scale, and was categorized as none-to-mild and moderate-to-severe frailty. All participants underwent quantitative electroencephalography (EEG), with band powers documented following the generation of the delta to alpha ratio (DAR) and delta/theta to alpha/beta ratio (DTABR). EEG results were then compared between groups of different levels of frailty.
BACKGROUND: Frailty is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. However, apart from its influence on cognition, it is currently unknown whether frailty affects subtler cerebral function in patients with ESRD.
RESULTS: In this cohort, (mean age: 68.9 ± 10.4 years, 37% male, 3.4 ± 3 years of dialysis), 20, 60, 40, 17, and 6% patients exhibited positivity in the fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss-of-body-weight domains, respectively, with 45.7% being none to mildly frail and 54.3% being moderately to severely frail. Those with mild frailty had a significantly higher delta power compared to those with more severe frailty, involving all topographic sites. Patients with ESRD and severe frailty had significantly lower global, left frontal, left temporo-occipital, and right temporo-occipital DAR and DTABR, except in the right frontal area, and tended to have central accentuation of alpha, beta, and theta power, and more homogeneous DTABR and DAR distribution compared to the findings in those with mild frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in patients with ESRD can have subtler neurophysiological influences, presenting as altered EEG findings, which warrant our attention.

N2  - Objective: To test whether frailty, a novel measure of physiologic reserve, is associated with longer kidney transplant (KT) length of stay (LOS), and modifies the association between LOS and mortality. Background: Better understanding of LOS is necessary for informed consent and discharge planning. Mortality resulting from longer LOS has important regulatory implications for hospital and transplant programs. Which recipients are at risk of prolonged LOS and its effect on mortality are unclear. Frailty is a novel preoperative predictor of poor KT outcomes including delayed graft function, early hospital readmission, immunosuppression intolerance, and mortality. Methods: We used registry-augmented hybrid methods, a novel approach to risk adjustment, to adjust for LOS risk factors from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (n = 74,859) and tested whether (1) frailty, measured immediately before KT in a novel cohort (n = 589), was associated with LOS (LOS: negative binomial regression; LOS ≥2 weeks: logistic regression) and (2) whether frailty modified the association between LOS and mortality (interaction term analysis). Results: Frailty was independently associated with longer LOS [relative risk = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.29; P = 0.01] and LOS ≥2 weeks (odds ratio = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.06-2.33; P = 0.03) after accounting for registry-based risk factors, including delayed graft function. Frailty also attenuated the association between LOS and mortality (nonfrail hazard rate = 1.55 95% CI: 1.30-1.86; P < 0.001; frail hazard rate = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.19, P = 0.80; P for interaction = 0.001). Conclusions: Frail KT recipients are more likely to experience a longer LOS. Longer LOS among nonfrail recipients may be a marker of increased mortality risk. Frailty is a measure of physiologic reserve that may be an important clinical marker of longer surgical LOS.

N2  - In the case of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), physicians are more and more facing the difficulties of managing VTE and their treatment in frail patients. These patients could present several at risk situation such as: chronic kidney disease (CKD), underweight or malnourished, falls, cognitive impairment, multi-medicated patients, cancer and pregnancy. Guidelines typically recommend anticoagulation. There are multiple challenges in the safe use of anticoagulation in frail patients, including bleeding risk, monitoring and adherence, and polypharmacy. The objective of this review is to explore these at-risk situations and to suggest adequate anticoagulation therapy, when possible, in each of these complex situations.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major concern in public health. The pathology of CKD includes premature ageing in the kidney and vessels, which results in a high risk of cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease. Many factors are involved in premature ageing in CKD, including hormonal imbalance, glycative stress, nitrogenous metabolites, and oxidative stress. Of these, the most important role in premature ageing in CKD is played by glycative stress, namely a massive and unfavourable glycation state, since the kidney is responsible for the clearance of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). In an animal model, overexpression of glyoxalase I (GLO-1), a detoxifier of AGEs, has been found to alleviate premature ageing in the kidney and vessels. Both lifestyle changes and drug therapy have shown promise in overcoming premature ageing. Promising drug therapies include a GLO-1 activator and an absorbent against glycotoxin and nitrogenous metabolites.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The clinical practice guidelines published by the Renal Physicians Association (USA) recommend instituting advance care planning (ACP) for patients with end-stage renal disease. Studies on this issue are lacking in Italy. Our aim was to determine the attitudes of patients on ACP in our dialysis centre.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey. We recruited patients on maintenance haemodialysis (HD) at Hemodialysis Center of Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, from 1 March 2014 to 31 March 2015. The only exclusion criterion was inability to give an informed consent. Patients completed a questionnaire concerning their treatment preferences in three hypothetical disease scenarios: persistent vegetative state, advanced dementia, severe terminal illness; for each patients, we also collected clinical, functional and socioeconomic data.
RESULTS: Thirty-four HD outpatients completed the study questionnaire. The majority of respondents (85%) considered information about prognosis, health conditions and treatment options, including withdrawing dialysis, as very important and 94% of respondents considered treatment of uraemic/dialytic symptoms the most important issue. In the health scenarios provided, dialysis was the treatment least withheld. Dependence on instrumental activities of daily living (0.048) and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (p=0.035) were associated with continuing dialysis in at least one scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: ACP should be tailored to patients' value, culture and preferences. A significant proportion of patients, however, do not want to be involved in end of life decisions. Frail elderly patients, in particular, are not inclined to interrupt dialysis, despite poor quality of life or a poor prognosis.

N2  - To assess whether biopsy-guided selection of kidneys from very old brain-dead donors enables more successful transplantations, the authors of this multicenter, observational study compared graft survival between 37 recipients of 1 or 2 histologically evaluated kidneys from donors older than 80 years and 198 reference-recipients of non–histologically evaluated single grafts from donors aged 60 years and younger (transplantation period: 2006-2013 at 3 Italian centers). During a median (interquartile range) of 25 (13-42) months, 2 recipients (5.4%) and 10 reference-recipients (5.1%) required dialysis (crude and donor age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.55 [0.34-7.12], P =.576 and 1.41 [0.10-19.54], P =.798, respectively). Shared frailty analyses confirmed similar outcomes in a 1:2 propensity score study comparing recipients with 74 reference-recipients matched by center, year, donor, and recipient sex and age. Serum creatinine was similar across groups during 84-month follow-up. Recipients had remarkably shorter waiting times than did reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (7.5 [4.0-19.5] vs 36 [19-56] and 40 [24-56] months, respectively, P <.0001 for both comparisons). Mean (± SD) kidney donor risk index was 2.57 ± 0.32 in recipients vs 1.09 ± 0.24 and 1.14 ± 0.24 in reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (P <.0001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were similar across groups. Biopsy-guided allocation of kidneys from octogenarian donors permits further expansion of the donor organ pool and faster access to a kidney transplant, without increasing the risk of premature graft failure.

N2  - Purpose Acetate in hemodialysis solutions exerts inflammatory, vasodilatatory and cardio-depressive effects. Citrate has been proposed as an optimal substitute. The aim of the present trial was the comparison of the hemodynamic and biological parameters on a group of patients dialysed consecutively with 4 acetate-free haemodialysis techniques. Methods In a prospective crossover manner, we measured the hemodynamic and biological effects of four acetate-free hemodialysis methods: he acetate-free biofiltration with variable potassium (AFBK) and three methods with a citrate buffer: onventional hemodialysis (HD), on-line hemodiafiltration (HDF) and on-line hemofiltration (HF). Fourteen chronic hemodialysis patients (9 males mean age 72.21 ± 11.21 years old) underwent 6 four-hour dialysis sessions for 2 weeks on each of the 4 studied techniques. Results The AFBK technique presented less intradialytic hypotensive episodes (1 in 84 sessions) compared to the other techniques (HD: 29/84, HDF 22/82 and HF: 14/78; P < 0.001). The blood pressure after one, two, three hours of dialysis and at the end of the hemodialysis session was significantly higher in the AFBK technique. On AFBK the net ultrafiltration (UF) (P < 0.001) and the UF as a percentage of the dry weight (P = 0.005) were significantly higher. A significant correlation between the prevalence of hypotensive episodes and the change of serum potassium levels (P = 0.002) during the first hour of dialysis was detected. Conclusions AFBK is associated with a better intradialytic hemodynamic tolerance and could be an optimal method for frail hypotension-prone hemodialysis patients.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on prevalence of frailty among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD is associated with malnutrition, chronic inflammation, acidemia, impaired hormonal changes, and low physical activity, all of which can directly and indirectly contribute to the development of frailty. Coexistence of ESRD and frailty has been shown to increase risks of adverse health outcomes. Given potential reversibility of frailty, it is important to examine frailty status in this high-risk population. Methods: Three databases (EMBASE, Medline, and CINAHL) were systematically searched for studies providing cross-sectional data of prevalence of frailty defined by cardiovascular health study (CHS) criteria among ESRD patients. Meta-analysis calculated pooled prevalence of frailty according to modifications of CHS criteria. Results: Of 837 studies identified through the systematic review, seven studies were included. Three studies used both objectively measured and self-reported CHS criteria, and two studies each used only either criteria. Pooled prevalence of frailty was 36.8% (five studies: 95% CI = 29.9–44.1%, I2 = 82.6%, p < 0.001) and 67.0% (five studies: 95% CI = 58.7–74.7%, I2 = 96.5%, p < 0.001) according to the objectively measured and self-reported CHS criteria, respectively. Conclusions: More than one-third of ESRD patients were frail based on the objectively measured CHS criteria, and that prevalence of frailty almost doubled with the CHS criteria substituting self-reported physical function questionnaire score for objective measurements. Given substantial difference in prevalence of frailty depending on the modifications to CHS criteria, this information should be taken into account when evaluating frailty status among ESRD population.

N2  - Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016. The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men. During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with overall decline in health and increased risk of hospitalization; disability and morbidities. Studies have shown high prevalence of frailty among patients on initiation of hemodialysis. AIM OF THE STUDY: Aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of frailty among chronic hemodialysis patients. METHODS: 108 chronic maintenance hemodialysis patients were assessed for frailty. Frailty was assessed by a 5 point scoring system wherein SF (Short Form) 36 quality of life questionnaire was used. 2 components from the SF-36 questionnaires were utilized in the frailty scoring-physical functioning (PF) and fatigue. PF of <75 was used as a marker of slowness and fatigue <55 was used a marker for poor endurance. Serum albumin <3 g/dl and Timed Up and Go (TUG) test <12 sec was used as a marker of weakness. Overall frailty was graded as 0-1: non-frail; 2: intermediate frail and ≥ 3: frail. RESULTS: Out of 108 subjects; 58 were males. Average age was 47.2 ± 14.7 years and average serum albumin was 3.7 ± 0.4 g/dl. Their average PF score was 50.6 ± 26.8 and vitality score was 57.4 ± 14.1. Average TUG time was 12.4 ± 4.6 seconds. Their average dialysis vintage was 5.1 ± 4 years. The average percentage of non-frail patients was 25.9%; of intermediate frail was 21.3% and that of frail patients was 52.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is very common among chronic hemodialysis patients. There is an urgent need to educate dialysis professionals in recognizing and evaluating frail patients and establishing target strategies.

N2  - ♦ Background: People’s experiences of living with assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) have not been studied previously. Assisted PD is successfully used as renal replacement therapy for elderly and disabled patients with end-stage renal disease. To be treated with aPD implies being dependent on lifelong treatment at home. The aim of this study was to explore adults’ experiences of living with aPD. ♦ Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 participants with aPD, median age 82.5 years. The text was analyzed using a phenomenological-hermeneutical method. ♦ Results: The participants experienced limitations and an uncertain future, but through different strategies and participation in healthcare, they could still enjoy what was important in life for them. The analysis of the text resulted in 4 main themes; 1) Facing new demands, 2) Managing daily life, 3) Partnership in care, and 4) Experiencing a meaningful life, leading to the comprehensive understanding: ‘Striving for maintaining wellbeing’. ♦ Conclusion: The participants expressed that they experienced a good quality of life despite being physically frail, severely ill, and in need of home-based lifesaving treatment. The findings suggest that aPD should be available everywhere where PD is offered. Integrating the model of person-centered care may greatly improve the care for persons living with aPD.

N2  - Purpose of review Frailty is highly prevalent in the dialysis population and is associated with mortality. Recent studies have suggested that other dialysis outcomes are compromised in frail individuals. While we do not yet have a consensus as to the best measure of frailty, identification of these poor outcomes and their magnitude of association with frailty will help improve prognostication, allow for earlier interventions, and improve provider-to-patient communication. Recent findings The most widely used assessment of frailty is Fried's physical performance criteria. However, regardless of assessment method, frailty remains highly associated with mortality. More recently, frailty has been associated with falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, vascular access failure, and poor quality of life. Recent large cohort studies provide strong evidence that frailty assessment can provide important prognostic information for providers and patients both before and after initiation of dialysis. Trials aimed at improving frailty are limited and show the promise of augmenting quality of life, although more studies are needed to firmly establish mortality benefits. Summary We underscore the importance of frailty as a prognostic indicator and identify other recently established consequences of frailty. Widespread adoption of frailty assessment remains limited and researchers continue to find ways of simplifying the data collection process. Timely and regular assessment of frailty may allow for interventions that can mitigate the onset of poor outcomes and identify actionable targets for dialysis providers.

N2  - Objective: To examine the association between serum β2-microglobulin (B2M) levels and frailty in an elderly Chinese population. Design: A population-based cohort study. Setting and participants: We used data on 1,663 elderly participants (aged 70-84 years) from the aging arm of the Rugao Longevity and Ageing study, a population-based observational two-arm cohort study conducted in Rugao, China. Measurements: The serum B2M was measured with chemiluminescence immunoassay by a technician in the biochemistry laboratory of the Rugao People’s Hospital. Information on the frailty index and phenotype was collected. Results: The mean B2M levels and frailty index were 1.8 mg/L and 0.16, respectively; 188 (11.3%) participants were classified as frail (frailty phenotype). For a standard deviation increase in B2M, the adjusted odds ratio for frailty phenotype was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.39; P=0.009) and the standardized coefficient for frailty index was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.11; P=0.004). Relative to the lowest quartile, the highest B2M quartile had a greater risk of prevalent frailty with adjusted odds ratios of 1.68 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.71; P=0.034) for frailty phenotype and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.27; P=0.044) for frailty index (≥0.25). In addition, estimated glomerular filtration rate (based on B2M) or chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was significantly associated with frailty phenotype and index. Conclusion: B2M was significantly associated with both frailty phenotype and index in elderly Chinese population. The findings underscore the promising kidney relevant biomarkers for identifying vulnerable elderly Chinese population.

N2  - Although the field of frailty research has expanded rapidly, it is still a nascent concept within the clinical specialties. Frailty, conceptualized as greater vulnerability to stressors because of significant depletion of physiological reserves, predicts poorer outcomes in several medical specialties, including cardiology, human immunodeficiency virus care, and nephrology, and in the behavioral and social sciences. Lack of a consensus definition, proliferation of measurement tools, inadequate understanding of the biology of frailty, and lack of validated clinical algorithms for frail individuals hinders incorporation of frailty assessment and frailty research into the specialties. In 2015, the American Geriatrics Society, the National Institute on Aging (NIA), and the Alliance for Academic Internal Medicine held a conference for awardees of the NIA-sponsored Grants for Early Medical/Surgical Specialists Transition into Aging Research program to review the current state of knowledge regarding frailty in the subspecialties and to highlight examples of integrating frailty research into the medical specialties. Research questions to advance frailty research into specialty medicine are proposed.

N2  - Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty. Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called “inflammaging” in the general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential causes and consequences, are discussed.

N2  - Aim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Methods: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/1.73 m2) was determined according to the serum creatinine level, and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0 (normal range), 45.0–59.9, 30.0–44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2. Frailty status was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss. Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty. Results: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2) were more frail (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01−3.59). In addition, individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21−8.24) or hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45−5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.13−14.1). Conclusions: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2017; 17: 1527–1533.

N2  - Unplanned postoperative intubation is an important event that may influence the outcome of thyroid- and parathyroidectomies. We performed a focused study on the association of preoperative functional status with unplanned intubation outcomes in these relatively common surgeries. METHODS: Utilizing data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from 2007 to 2013, a propensity score-matched retrospective cohort study was performed assessing this outcome in the functionally independent versus dependent groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and a Cox proportional hazards model were performed to assess the difference. RESULTS: There were a total of 98,035 thyroid- and parathyroidectomies identified from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2007 to 2013. After propensity score matching, there were 1,862 and 931 cases in the independent and dependent group, respectively. There were 11 versus 33 per 1,000 persons in the independent and dependent group, respectively, who experienced an unplanned intubation within 30 d following surgery (P <.001). The dependent group showed worse intubation-free survival over 30 d (P <.001). There were no differences in this outcome during postoperative days 0–1 (P =.17). Dependent functional status was statistically significantly associated with unplanned intubations up to 30 d postoperatively (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.4–4.18, P =.002). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative functional status is a good marker for identifying patients at risk for re-intubation after thyroid- and parathyroidectomy.

N2  - Introduction: Relapsed/refractory Multiple Myeloma (rrMM) requiring hemodialysis is a life-threatening condition and treatment options are limited. Since lenalidomide (L) is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidney, adjustments to the starting dose are recommended. Unfortunately, there are limited experiences in patients with renal impairment who received L, and severe adverse events occur with a high frequency in patients with rrMM requiring hemodialysis treated with L. Discussions We reported our retrospective study of four patients (4 male; median age 73.5 years [range 62-77]) with rrMM requiring dialysis before receiving “lenalidomide plus desamethasone” (LD). Three patients developed renal failure before MM diagnosis, one patient during progressive disease development. A different L dose adjustment (5 mg every other day on days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle after dialysis) from the recommendations of the manufacturer was chosen due to additional fragilities (serious comorbidities and advanced age). Until initiation of therapy with L, renal failure persisted for a median of 28 months (range 26-96).All patients achieved at least a PR. No patients with partial or complete myeloma remission received partial or complete renal response. (Table presented) The median number of L cycles was 12 (range 6-19 cycles). The median time to best response was 3,5 months (range 2-6). After 24 months, all patients are alive at the time of analysis and at time of last followup; 2 patients were still receiving “LD”, preserving haematological response reached; 2 patients stopped treatment due to progression, with a median duration of response of 13,5 months (range 6-21). Only one patient developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia without blending events. No grade 3-4 neutropenia, gastrointestinal adverse events, thromboembolic complications or serious infectious episodes were reported. Conclusion: Different L dose adjustment (5 mg every other day on days 1-21) from the recommendations reported in the approved summary of product characteristics is associated with a high response rate and a long duration of response. In addition, we observed a lower-than-expected incidence of haematological toxicities without an excess of prolonged cytopenia despite long-term exposure to L. L dose adjustments minimize excessive toxicities and make the combination “LD” as an effective and well tolerated therapeutic option also in very frail/unfit patients with rrMM requiring dialysis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Psoas muscle area (PMA) is a validated indicator of frailty and sarcopenia that can be easily measured on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans. There has yet to be a study examining the prognostic impact of sarcopenia in patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this retrospective study, pre- and post-operative CT scans were retrieved for adult patients transplanted between 2000-2015 and followed at the Heart Transplant Clinic of the McGill University Health Centre. PMA was measured on axial images at the level of the L4 vertebrae using the CoreSlicer software. Outcomes of interest were ascertained by chart review and included long-term mortality and in-hospital major adverse postoperative events (MAPE; defined as mortality, prolonged intubation, stroke, dialysis, mediastinitis, or reoperation). Out of 157 patients transplanted, 82 patients had at least one abdominal CT scan over an average follow-up of 3 years. The median PMA was 24.7 cm2 (IQR 20.9, 30.0) in men, 16.6 cm2 (IQR 14.9, 19.1) in women, and decreased by 8-11% from the first to the last available CT scan. Patients with smaller PMA, defined as less than the sex-stratified median, had a four-fold increase in MAPE (OR 4.28; 95% CI 1.18, 15.46) and a trend towards a three-fold increase in long-term mortality (HR 3.12; 95% CI 0.96, 10.20). Adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and cardiomyopathy etiology, every 1 cm2 increase in PMA was found to be significantly associated with a 17% reduction in MAPE (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72, 0.96) and a 9% reduction in long-term mortality (HR 0.91; 95%CI 0.83-0.99). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia as defined by PMA is associated with a higher risk of mortality and major morbidity after cardiac transplantation. Further studies are needed to define the longitudinal progression of sarcopenia in this population and test the value of muscle-building interventions such as exercise and protein supplementation to improve short- and long-term outcomes.

N2  - Objectives To derive and validate a risk prediction equation to estimate the short term risk of death, and to develop a classification method for frailty based on risk of death and risk of unplanned hospital admission.Design Prospective open cohort study.Participants Routinely collected data from 1436 general practices contributing data to QResearch in England between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used to develop the scores and a separate set of 357 practices to validate the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 65-100 years were in the derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the validation cohort.Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation cohort were used to derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation of the risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index, medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group. The new mortality equation was used in conjunction with the existing QAdmissions equation (which predicts risk of unplanned hospital admission) to classify patients into frailty groups.Main outcome measure The primary outcome was all cause mortality.Results During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the derivation cohort arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The final model included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic group, smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the past 12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive heart failure, corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, learning disability, leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, poor mobility, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result, high platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite loss, unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the equation explained 55.6% of the variation in time to death (R2), and had very good discrimination-the D statistic was 2.29, and Harrell's C statistic value was 0.85. The corresponding values for men were 53.1%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining predicted risks of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7% of patients (n=13 665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4% (n=46 770) as moderately frail, 43.1% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8% (n=223 790) as fit.Conclusions We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of death in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social, and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction with the QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty groups (known as QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be identified for further assessment or interventions.

N2  - Background and objectivesA geriatric assessment is an appropriatemethod foridentifying frail elderly patients. In CKD, it may contribute to optimize personalized care. However, a geriatric assessment is time consuming. The purpose of our study was to compare easy to apply frailty screening tools with the geriatric assessment in patients eligible for dialysis. Design, setting, participants, & measurements A total of 123 patients on incident dialysis ≥65 years old were included <3 weeks before to ≤2 weeks after dialysis initiation, and all underwent a geriatric assessment. Patients with impairment in two or more geriatric domains on the geriatric assessment were considered frail. The diagnostic abilities of six frailty screening tools were compared with the geriatric assessment: the Fried Frailty Index, the Groningen Frailty Indicator, Geriatric8, the Identification of Seniors at Risk, the Hospital Safety Program, and the clinical judgment of the nephrologist. Outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. ResultsIn total, 75% of patients were frail according to the geriatric assessment. Sensitivity of frailty screening tools ranged from 48% (Fried Frailty Index) to 88% (Geriatric8). The discriminating features of the clinical judgment were comparable with the other screening tools. The Identification of Seniors at Risk screening tool had the best discriminating abilities,with a sensitivity of 74%, a specificity of 80%, a positivepredictive value of 91%, and a negative predictive value of 52%. The negative predictive value was poor for all tools, which means that almost one half of the patients screened as fit (nonfrail) had two or more geriatric impairments on the geriatric assessment. ConclusionsAll frailty screening tools are able to detect geriatricimpairmentin elderly patients eligible for dialysis. However, all applied screening tools, including the judgment of the nephrologist, lack the discriminating abilities to adequately rule out frailty compared with a geriatric assessment.

N2  - Introduction & Objective: Surgical complications are difficult to predict, despite the existing assessment tools used by physicians. Frailty, as a phenotype, has shown great promise in the estimation of postoperative risk amongst the elderly and infirm. We sought to evaluate the use of a frailty index as a predictive tool on patients undergoing percutaneous renal surgery at a high volume institution. Materials and Methods: Frailty was prospectively analyzed prior to surgery in all consenting patients using the Hopkins Frailty Index, consisting of 5 components yielding an additive score. Patients were categorized as not frail, intermediate, or severely frail, depending on overall score. Primary outcomes assessed were complications during admission and the 30-day complication rate. Secondary outcomes included overall hospital length of stay (LOS) and discharge location. Results: 78 patients were included in the analysis. In total, 58 (74%), 13 (17%), and 7 (9%) patients were in the not frail, intermediate, and severely frail categories. Overall, intermediate or frail patients were more likely to have underlying chronic kidney disease (p < 0.05), anemia (p < 0.01), or prior abdominal surgery (p < 0.04). Intraoperatively, intermediate or frail patients were not more likely to experience higher blood loss or to have a higher stone burden. Of the five frailty metrics, grip strength alone was predictive of post-operative complications (p < 0.01). When compared with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score and Charlson comorbidity index, frailty class alone was predictive of the incidence of complications during admission (p < 0.03), but not 30-day post-operative complications (p = 0.33). Extended length of stay (p < 0.001), along with specific complications like fever (p < 0.0063), sepsis (p < 0.0001), bacteremia (p < 0.0004), hemorrhage requiring embolization (p < 0.03), and hemodynamic instability requiring intensive care (ICU) admission (p < 0.0008) were more common with in individuals with higher frailty scores. Frailer individuals tended to require higher level of care upon hospital discharge (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Frailty assessment appears useful in stratifying those at risk for extended hospitalization and those unable to return home without assistance following percutaneous renal surgery. Risks of sepsis, bacteremia, and post-operative hemorrhage may be higher in frail individuals. Incorporated into the preoperative assessment, the frailty phenotype may give further insight into treatment decisions and the prediction of postoperative outcomes and may represent a modifiable marker for patient optimization prior to surgery.

N2  - Introduction: Frailty is associated both with an increased risk of cognitive decline, and the development of Chronic Kidney disease. In primary care units Frailty Ambulatory is dedicated to elderly people and is an example of health innovation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between renal and cognitive functions in the frail elderly. Methods: Frailty Ambulatories have to facilitate the "art" of caring complex elderly patients' needs through geriatricians and out-of-hospital network services. We analyzed data from 271 consecutive patients visited in our ambulatories. The starting point is caring patients and their needs. The first step is represented by over-65 year-old patients' selection according to prefrailty and frailty Fried's criteria. We performed multidimensional assessment and kidney function assessment in all the patients. Results: Of 271 patients, 109 (40,22%) were men, mean age 82,74±6,77 years old; BMI was 22,65±2,21 kg/m#sup#2#/sup#; CKD-EPI eGFR was 64,25±25,04 ml/min/1,73 m#sup#2#/sup#. After performing multidimensional assessment we found the following scores: MMSE 12,18±3,65; ADL 0,90±2,02; IADL 0,04±0,189. In the 271 patients analyzed we detected a positive correlation between cognitive function and the estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR). After multivariate analysis the relationship was confirmed (beta=0,474; p=0,000). Conclusions: Experimental activity in Frailty Ambulatories could offer a tool able to recognize conditions of prefrailty/frailty. Frailty, assessed through Renal function and cognitive functions are signifi-canty related in the frail elderly.

N2  - Background: Frailty represents a state of vulnerability and a decline in functioning across multiple physiological body systems. There is growing evidence that frailty and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are valuable criteria to predict poor outcomes in adult kidney transplant (KT) candidates. There is, however, limited information about the prevalence of both conditions in KT patients. We assessed the prevalence of frailty and MCI in adults at the time of kidney transplantation. Methods: This is the baseline assessment of a prospective cohort study nested in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS). A convenience sample of 74 adult deceased- and living donor KT candidates (mean age 51.6 ± 13.7 years, 36.5% female) of 5 Swiss transplant centers were included. Frailty and MCI were measured using the Fried Frailty Instrument (frail, prefrail, robustness) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test, respectively. Descriptive and inferential analysis was performed. Results: The prevalence of frailty, pre-frailty, and robustness was 10.8%, 45.9% and 40.5%, respectively (Figure 1). 45.9% of participants had MCI and of those 24.2% had MCI and were frail or pre-frail. There was no significant association between frailty and MCI at time of transplantation. Prevalence of frailty was not significantly associated with age, gender, education, depression status or comorbidities. Conclusion: The prevalence of frailty/pre-frailty and MCI in renal transplant candidates in Switzerland is high, yet more patients are pre-frail compared to international findings (see Figure 1). Given that pre-frailty can be targeted with interventions, incorporating frailty screening would allow healthcare professionals to systematically identify individuals at risk and initiate pre-habilitation before transplantation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Survival for patients commencing renal replacement therapy is around 90% in the first year and 83% at two years after starting dialysis. The factors that appear to predict mortality are comorbidity and frailty associated with kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate, age and biochemical factors.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse the condition of patients starting renal replacement therapy, based on biomarkers commonly used in clinical practice and their association with mortality, measured 6 and 12 months after initiating replacement therapy.
METHODS: A one-year prospective follow-up study with 189 patients. Sociodemographic variables, aetiology of renal disease, comorbidities, prior nephrology service monitoring, prior renal transplantation and biochemical parameters at the time of initiating replacement therapy were analysed.
RESULTS: The overall percentage of death during the one-year follow-up was 6.87%, with 64% of deaths occurring during the first six months. The only variable independently associated with mortality was low albumin levels.
CONCLUSION: Although most patients in this centre are monitored by a nephrologist prior to starting replacement therapy, many nevertheless fail to achieve the biochemical targets recommended. One such parameter is albumin, which proved at the start of replacement therapy to be an independent predictor of mortality. Findings of this study show the need to intervene on certain biochemical parameters during the pre-dialysis stage and at the start of dialysis, in order to improve survival in this group of patients.

N2  - Background: Lytic bone lesions in the elderly often raise the spectre of disseminated malignancy. Uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism can occasionally cause similar lesions as part of the spectrum of osteitis fibrosis cystica. Case report: A frail 76-year old gentleman on maintenance haemodialysis for hypertensive nephropathy developed a clavicular fracture with minimal trauma after months of unexplained weight loss. He had a background of sustained hyperparathyroidism (iPTH >100picomol/L) but was too frail for parathyroidectomy and did not tolerate calcimimetics. Other medical issues included chronic diarrhoea, an episode of cardiac arrest and prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation from which he recovered and amaurosis fugax. CT and X-ray investigations revealed multiple osteolytic lesions in the appendicular skeleton, left scapula and clavicle. These were in conjunction with heterogeneous bone marrow pattern of the pelvis, osteodystrophy of the spine and a right pleural effusion with suspected mass lesion. Whole-body positronemission tomography showed no uptake in the effusion or suspected pleural mass, focal increased uptake in the appendicular skeleton and diffuse uptake in the axial skeleton. Screening tests for multiple myeloma and prostate cancer were negative. A bone biopsy of his right fibular lesion showed numerous osteoclast-type giant cells consistent with brown tumours of hyperparathyroidism. He subsequently became progressively unwell and bed-bound because of severe bone pains. He eventually died after withdrawal from dialysis. Conclusions: Formation of brown tumours represent a rare complication of longstanding uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient on long-term dialysis with multiple skeletal lytic lesions.

N2  - Patients with diabetes undergoing dialysis are a frail group with multiple co-morbidities, whose care often requires multiple clinical teams. Coordinating care can be difficult for both patients and current systems. We performed an audit of patients with diabetes attending for maintenance haemodialysis (n=56, mean age 68.7 years), and aimed to define this cohort, and, with patient input, how to improve the coordination of diabetes care. 89% (n=50) had type 2 DM, 9% (n=2) had type 1 DM and 2% (n=1) had DM secondary to pancreatitis. 63% (n=35) had diabetic nephropathy. Mean HbA1c 60.5 mmol/mol (range 30-99 mmol/mol). We also identified a number of patients 7% (n=4) who were experiencing troublesome hypoglycaemic episodes. 16% (n=9) were not receiving regular diabetes review, 30% (n=17) were attending GP, 48% (n=27) were attending a hospital clinic and 6% (n=3) were receiving visits from community DSN. 46% (n=26) had known eye complications, and 43% (n=24) had foot disease (2 patients had active foot ulcers). Only 70% (n=39) had attended retinal screening and 80% (n=45) had received a foot check in the last year. 60% (n=34) required assistance with transport to appointments and 38% (n=21) required assistance to administer medications. On questioning, patients stated they had difficulty attending and coordinat ing appointments for other services wi th their haemodialysis. Patients' preference was for a mobile diabetes clinic. Our audit demonstrates a frail cohort with multiple complications who require coordinated multidisciplinary care. As a result of these findings, we are piloting a mobile multidisciplinary diabetes clinic at the bedside in the dialysis unit.

N2  - Many patients become frail with diminished cardiorespiratory fitness while awaiting kidney transplantation. Frailty and poor fitness powerfully predict mortality, transplant graft survival, and healthcare utilization after kidney transplantation. Efforts to intervene with post-transplant physical therapy have been met with limited success, in large part due to high study dropout. We reviewed the literature on chronic kidney disease and exercise to propose a clinical framework for physical therapy interventions to improve fitness, scheduled for before the transplant. This framework may lead to better patient retention and compliance, and thus demonstrate better efficacy in mitigating the effects of frailty and poor fitness after kidney transplantation.

N2  - Background: Patients with HFpEF frequently have multiple comorbid conditions. Frailty is common and associated with adverse outcomes in multimorbid older adults, but the prevalence and clinical implications of frailty in HFpEF have not been fully defined. Methods: In a single-center prospective cohort study (July 2016-March 2017), pa-tients referred for HFpEF management underwent 5-meter gait speed testing. Patients were considered frail based on slow gait speed, defined as a time taken to walk 5 meters of >6 seconds (<0.83 meters/second) or if unable to perform due to physical limitation. We compared the distribution of comorbidities and selected laboratory tests using t-testing or chi-square testing as appropriate. Using Wilcoxon rank-sum testing, we also compared suffering > 2 falls and the number of all-cause hospitalizations within the past year, and the previously validated Heart Failure Patient Severity Index (HFPSI, predicts 6-month risk of death and/or all cause medical hospitalization in HF clinic outpatients). Results: 51 patients with HFpEF were assessed (age 67 + 12 years, 61% female). Overall, 65% had >5 comorbid conditions and polypharmacy (>5 prescribed medications) was present in 88%. Frail patients (n = 25, with 8 of those patients unable to walk), relative to non-frail (n = 26), were older (71 vs 63 years, P =.007) and more commonly female (76% vs 46%, P=.03). There were no significant between-group differences for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, arthritis, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, depression, or total comorbidity count (all P >.05). Frail patients had lower albumin (4.0 + 0.35 vs. 4.3 + 0.36, P =.04) and tended to have lower hemoglobin (11.7 + 1.9 vs 13.3 + 2.0, P=.087) and higher BUN (33 + 18 vs 26 + 18, P=.20) and BNP (245 + 320 vs 131 + 157, P=.12). The frail group had experienced significantly more falls (24% with >2 falls vs. 0%, P=.008) and all-cause hospitalizations (1.7 + 1.7 vs 1.0 + 1.5, P =.05) over the past year, and also had higher predicted 6-month risk by HFPSI score (P =.01). Conclusions: Nearly half of outpatients with HFpEF were categorized as frail by slow gait speed or inability to perform a 5-meter walk. These patients had more frequent falls and hospitalizations over the year prior to referral and higher predicted risk of hospitalization and death over the subsequent 6 months. Our findings suggest that assessing frailty could help more comprehensively define prognosis and clinical care pathways for patients with HFpEF.

N2  - Patients with inoperable, high-risk, and intermediate-risk aortic stenosis can now be treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration selectively choose centers based on experience and require a collaborative, multidisciplinary team approach in the treatment and decision making for these patients. The work-up has been streamlined. Gated multislice computed tomography angiogram has emerged as the gold standard for assessment of valve anatomy and sizing of the transcatheter heart valve. Assessment of risk has evolved to include a more comprehensive functional and frailty evaluation. Long term-results are needed before the expansion of transcatheter aortic valve replacement into the low-risk category.

N2  - In this consensus paper, the Belgian Bone Club aims to provide a state of the art on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of osteoporosis in frail individuals, including patients with anorexia nervosa, patients on dialysis, cancer patients, persons with sarcopenia, and the oldest old. All these conditions may indeed induce bone loss that is superimposed on physiological bone loss and often remains under-recognized and under-treated. This is of particular concern because of the major burden of osteoporotic fractures in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic cost. Therefore, there is an urgent need to appreciate bone loss associated with these conditions, as this may improve diagnosis and management of bone loss and fracture risk in clinical practice.

N2  - Dementia is a common and serious complication in patients with heart failure (HF). However, an association of dementia with social backgrounds, mortality and other event, have not been well documented in HF. Methods: We have enrolled 746 patients with acute heart failure (AHF) at 13 hospitals in Kitakawachi located at the eastern end of the city of Osaka, Japan, from April 2015 to January 2017. The KICKOFF Registry is a prospective multicenter community-based cohort of HF patients. We compared the social backgrounds and mortality between patients with dementia (dementia; n=215) and without (non-dementia; n=531). Dementia was diagnosed if it had been previously diagnosed by the criteria of Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. Result: The patients with dementia were older, low BMI, more female, and longer mean length of hospitalization than non-dementia (84.7±7.6 vs. 74.1±11.6 years of age; p<0.01, 66.5% vs. 41.2%; p<0.01, 29.5±23.2 vs. 23.0±17.8 days; p<0.01, respectively). The dementia group had less dyslipidemia, but more chronic kidney disease, and old cerebral infraction than the non-dementia group (25.1% vs. 39.7%; p<0.01, 60.9% vs. 49.9%; p<0.01, 16.7% vs. 9%; p<0.01, respectively). In social backgrounds, 20.9% of the patients with dementia lived alone, 15.4% lived with a partner, and of these, 46.2% had the support of other family members. The dementia group had less control for both their diet and drug therapies than the non-dementia group (17.7% vs. 36.9%; p<0.01, 36.7% vs. 85.9%; p<0.01). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the hospitalization of HF and the mortality were higher in patients with dementia than those without during six-month follow-up (p<0.01). After the adjustment in multiple logistics regression models, dementia was independently associated with higher risk of the hospitalization for HF (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.29; p=0.05) and the mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-4.87; p<0.01). Conclusion: Our study provides unique information detailed the social backgrounds of HF patients with dementia. The patients with dementia had a serious risk of social frailty. Dementia was independently higher risk of mortality and the hospitalization in AHF.

N2  - Background and objectives Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes. Design, setting, participants, & measurements To address these questions, we examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during follow-up. Results The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants’ scores changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change, 0.2 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity (0.6 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores (-1.1 points per g/dl; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition, patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction in frailty score (95% confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic rate was not independently associated with frailty. Conclusions There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores, with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.

N2  - Background and objectives Technique failure is a major limitation of peritoneal dialysis. Our study aimed to identify center- and patient-level predictors of peritoneal dialysis technique failure. Design, setting, participants, & measurements All patients on incident peritoneal dialysis in Australia from 2004 to 2014 were included in the study using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. Center- and patient-level characteristics associated with technique failure were evaluated using Cox shared frailty models. Death-censored technique failure and cause-specific technique failure were analyzed as secondary outcomes. Results The study included 9362 patients from 51 centers in Australia. The technique failure rate was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.36) episodes per patient-year, with a sevenfold variation across centers that was mainly associated with center-level characteristics. Technique failure was significantly less likely in centers with larger proportions of patients treatedwith peritoneal dialysis (>29%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95%confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.94) andmore likely insmaller centers (<16newpatientsper year; adjustedhazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.21) and centers with lower proportions of patients achieving target baseline serum phosphate levels (<40%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.29). Similar results were observed for death-censored technique failure, except that center target phosphate achievement was not significantly associated. Technique failure due to infection, social reasons, mechanical causes, or death was variably associated with center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal dialysis, and/or target phosphate achievement, automatedperitoneal dialysis exposure, icodextrin use, andantifungal use. The variation of hazards of technique failure across centerswas reducedby 28%after adjusting forpatient-specific factors andan additional 53% after adding center-specific factors. Conclusions Technique failurevarieswidelyacross centers inAustralia.Asignificantproportionof thisvariationis related to potentially modifiable center characteristics, including peritoneal dialysis center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal dialysis, and proportion of patients on peritoneal dialysis achieving target phosphate level.

N2  - Patients with serious illness deserve information about their prognosis to make informed decisions about the medical care they receive and how they wish to approach personal goals at the end of life. Hospitalizations present an opportunity to reassess prognosis and goals of care. Estimating and discussing prognosis are core competencies for hospitalists and should be offered to patients with serious illness. Ask–tell–ask is a practical approach for discussing prognosis (ask what the patients knows and what they want to know; tell with a direct, honest prognosis as a range; ask what the patient understands and if questions remain).

N2  - Global burden disease studies point out that one of the top cause-specific anemias is iron deficiency (ID). Recent advances in knowledge of iron homeostasis have shown that fragile patients are a new target population in which the correction of ID might impact their morbidity, mortality and quality of life. We did a systematic review using specific search strategy, carried out the review of PubMed database, Cochrane Database of systemic reviews and international guidelines on diagnosis and clinical management of ID from 2010 to 2016. The International guidelines were limited to those with peer–review process and published in journal present in citation index database. The eligible studies show that serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are the key tests in early decision-making process to identify iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The clinician has to carefully consider fragile and high-risk subset of patients such as elders or individuals with chronic diseases (i.e chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic heart failure). Treatment is based on iron supplementation. Infusion route should be preferentially considered in frail patients especially in the view of new iron available formulations. The available evidences indicate that (i) recurrent IDA should always be investigated, considering uncommon causes; (ii) IDA might worse the performance and the clinical outcome of fragile and high-risk patients and require an intensive treatment.

N2  - Objectives The authors sought to investigate the prognostic impact of revascularization for poor-risk CLI patients in real-world settings. Background Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is often accompanied with various comorbidities, and frailty is not rare in the population. Although previous studies suggested favorable outcomes of revascularization for CLI patients, those studies commonly included the healthier, that is, less frail patients. Methods This was a multicenter prospective observational study, registering patients who presented with CLI and who required assistance for their daily lives because of their disability in activities of daily living (ADL) and/or impairment of cognitive function. Revascularization was either planned (revascularization group) or not planned (non-revascularization group). The primary endpoint was 1-year survival, and was compared between the revascularization and non-revascularization groups, using the propensity score-matching method. Results Between January 2014 and April 2015, a total of 662 patients were registered, of those 100 non-revascularization patients were included. A total of 625 patients (94.4%) completed the 1-year follow-up. Death was observed in 223 patients (33.7%). After propensity score matching, the 1-year survival rate was 55.9% in the revascularization group versus 51.0% in the non-revascularization group, with no significant difference (p = 0.120). In the subgroups alive at 1 year after revascularization, health-related quality of life was significantly improved compared with baseline, whereas ADL scores were unchanged from baseline and still remained significantly worse than before CLI onset. Conclusions The 1-year overall survival rate was not significantly different between the revascularization and non-revascularization groups in poor-risk CLI patients.

N2  - Background: The risk of incorrect medication dosing is high in frail older people. Therefore, accurate assessment of the glomerular filtration rate is important. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the estimated glomerular filtration rate using creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, in frail older people. We hypothesized that frailty determines the difference between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae. Methods: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C was determined using (cross-sectional) data of 55 patients (mean age 73 years) admitted to a psychiatric ward for older adults. The level of agreement of these estimations was assessed by a Bland–Altman analysis. In all patients, the Rockwood’s Frailty Index was derived and correlated with the mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C. Results: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine (mean 71.2 mL/min/1.73 m2) and CKD-EPI cystatin C (mean 57.6 mL/min/1.73 m2) was 13.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.0001). The two standard deviation limit in the Bland–Altman plot was large (43.2 mL/min/1.73 m2), which represents a low level of agreement. The Frailty Index did not correlate with the mean difference between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based glomerular filtration rate (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.182, p = 0.184). Conclusions: There was a significant gap between a creatinine- and cystatin C-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate, irrespective of frailty. The range of differences between the commonly used estimated glomerular filtration rate formulae might result in clinically relevant differences in drug prescription and differences in chronic kidney disease staging.

N2  - Background: The number of multiple myeloma patients has grown with aging populations, and with increasing age the number of comorbidities increases as well. Clinically, it is well known that comorbidity in multiple myeloma patients decreases performance status, increases risk of therapy-related complications and may lead to life-threatening conditions. Currently, the literature on comorbidity in multiple myeloma is very limited and based on small case series. Clinical trials rarely include elderly, frail patients due to eligibility criteria. Population-based studies provide valuable information on survival outcomes in relation to presence/absence of comorbidities in newly diagnosed real-life multiple myeloma patients in the general population. Aims: To evaluate the prevalence of comorbidities and to study the impact of comorbidities on survival among patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Methods: All newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma from January 1st 1990 to December 31st 2013 in Sweden were included in the study. Using the Swedish Patient Registry, all discharge diagnosis and discharge listings were gathered from each patient from January 1st 1985. Comorbid conditions were defined as chronic illnesses which demand life-long treatment or followup. Only those diagnoses made prior to multiple myeloma were used. Using ICD 8, 9 and 10 codes, comorbid diseases were identified. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival. Risk of death was compared among multiple myeloma patients with a comorbid condition to those without a comorbidity, using Cox's proportional hazards regression (adjusting for age, gender, year of diagnosis, and other comorbid conditions). Results: A total of 13,718 patients with multiple myeloma were included in the study and 21 groups of comorbidities were identified. The most common diseases were cancer, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation. Among all patients, 55% had no prior history of comorbidity, 23% had one comorbidity, 12% had two comorbidities, and 10% had three or more comorbid conditions. Survival was negatively influenced by the number of comorbidities (Figure 1). The risk of death was significantly increased in patients with atrial fibrillation (HR=1.08; 95% CI 1.00-1.16), heart failure (HR=1.50; 95% CI 1.40-1.61), stroke (HR=1.20; 95% CI 1.11-1.30), psychological disease (HR=1.27; 95% CI 1.16-1.39), chronic lung disease (HR=1.22; 95% CI 1.12-1.32), diabetes (HR=1.14; 95% CI 1.04-1.36), peripheral vascular disease (HR=1.26; 95% CI 1.12-1.42), cancer (HR=1.10; 95% CI 1.04-1.16), dementia (HR=1.65; 95% CI 1.38-1.99), paralysis (HR=1.44; 95% CI 1.15-1.80), inflammatory bowel disease (HR=1.38; 95% CI 1.08-1.74), end stage renal disease (HR=1.57; 95% CI 1.03-2.04), and cirrhosis (HR=1.64; 95% CI 1.10-2.43). (Figure presented) Summary/Conclusions: In this large, population-based study including almost 14,000 patients, we have shown that comorbidities are common among newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and that comorbidities are associated with an inferior survival. Importantly, the number of comorbidities showed a dose-response relationship with inferior overall survival. For example, the median overall survival for patients with 3 or more comorbidities was reduced by more than 50% compared to patients without comorbidities. The importance of comorbidities should be taken into account when evaluating patients and deciding on treatment strategies for individuals with multiple myeloma.

N2  - Elevated blood pressure is one of the most significant risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD); its treatment is a milestone in CKD management. While it is accepted that a stricter blood pressure control is indicated in patients with proteinuria or microalbuminuria, the exact degree of blood pressure reduction to be obtained in CKD patients is still under debate. Following more recent interpretation of old trials, a BP target for <140/90 mmHg is suggested for non-proteinuric CKD patients. In those with microalbuminuria/proteinuria, the ideal blood pressure target should be ≤130/80 mmHg. Recently, the SPRINT trial put new emphasis on a stricter blood pressure control, mainly from the cardiovascular point of view. The blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are recommended as first line treatment in all CKD hypertensive patients with micro or macroalbuminuria either diabetics or not. However, their nephroprotective efficacy is less relevant in non-proteinuric patients. The dual RAS blockade was proposed as an additional option. Despite a greater antiproteinuric effect, some large trials in patients at high cardiovascular risk did not demonstrate significant advantage on hard endpoint. Its use is now contraindicated in diabetic CKD patients. Given that RAS blockers can cause acute derangements in kidney function and hyperkalemia, caution is needed with their use, especially in frail and old patients with cardiovascular disease or in the presence of advanced CKD.

N2  - Patients with chronic kidney disease experience substantial loss of muscle mass, weakness, and poor physical performance. As kidney disease progresses, skeletal muscle dysfunction forms a common pathway for mobility limitation, loss of functional independence, and vulnerability to disease complications. Screening for those at high risk for mobility disability by self-reported and objective measures of function is an essential first step in developing an interdisciplinary approach to treatment that includes rehabilitative therapies and counseling on physical activity. Exercise has beneficial effects on systemic inflammation, muscle, and physical performance in chronic kidney disease. Kidney health providers need to identify patient and care delivery barriers to exercise in order to effectively counsel patients on physical activity. A thorough medical evaluation and assessment of baseline function using self-reported and objective function assessment is essential to guide an effective individualized exercise prescription to prevent function decline in persons with kidney disease. This review focuses on the impact of kidney disease on skeletal muscle dysfunction in the context of the disablement process and reviews screening and treatment strategies that kidney health professionals can use in clinical practice to prevent functional decline and disability.

N2  - Background: Recent reports have suggested that mortality and morbidity in patients with concomitant upper limb and hip fractures vary depending on the sites of fracture. Objectives: To determine the mortality outcomes in elderly patients with concomitant upper limb (wrist or humerus) and hip fractures compared to patients with isolated hip fractures. The secondary objective was to determine the length of hospital stay during acute care, morbidity characteristics and perioperative complication rates. Methods: 144 older adults with concomitant upper limb and hip fractures were compared to 2,690 older adults with isolated hip fractures in a single-centre tertiary hospital. Blinded patient data were extracted from our Inpatient Separation Information System based on ICD-10 codes for analysis and comparison between the groups. A multivariate regression survival analysis was performed to determine mortality outcomes. Results: No difference in mortality was shown between patient groups in the short and long term. Older adults with concomitant humeral and hip fractures had a higher prevalence of cognitive disorders and chronic kidney disease, while those with concomitant wrist and hip fractures had the lowest. Those with concomitant upper limbs fracture had a longer length of stay during the acute care, as well as a greater requirement for blood transfusions. Conclusions: When compared to isolated hip fracture patients, older adults with concomitant hip and humeral fractures may represent a frailer group, but not necessary in those with concomitant hip and wrist fractures.

N2  - Objectives: With an increase of frail patients, including dialysis and severe ischemic heart disease (IHD), surgical revascularization is still preferable in some patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) to accomplish limb salvage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of lower extremity ultrasound-guided nerve blockage (UGNB) in infrapopliteal artery bypass grafting (IPABG). Methods: The study enrolled 38 CLIs who underwent IPABG under UGNB in Asahikawa Medical University from May 2012 on. The main indication of UGNB was heart disease (60%). Femoral nerve and sciatic nerve with/without obturator nerve blockades were performed. Advantages of perioperative management and postoperative surgical outcomes within 30 days of IPABG with UGNE were evaluated compared with that of IPABG for CLIs performed under general anesthesia (GA) by 2011 in the institute using propensity score matching based on preoperative comorbidities (tolerance <.03). Results: Thirty-one CLI pairs were matched and analyzed (71.0% vs 64.5% in dialysis, 80.6% vs 83.9% in diabetes, and 54.8% vs 48.4% in ischemic heart disease, for UGNB vs GA, respectively). IPABG with UGNB included five below-knee popliteal bypasses, on the other hand, IPABGs with GA were totally distal bypasses (P =.02). Intraoperatively, operation time was longer in UGNB (401 ± 107 vs 341 ± 107 minutes; P =.04), whereas the amount of dopamine, infusion, and blood transfusion was less in UGNB (0.67 ± 0.75 vs 1.53 ± 1.99 mg/kg, P =.03; 1700 ± 800 vs 2812 ± 1195 mL, P <.01; and 237 ± 342 vs 462 ± 321 mL, P =.02, respectively) despite of equal blood loss (280 vs 296 mL; P =.81). Postoperatively, starting timing of drinking and diet after surgery were 0.61 days and 0.97 days in UGNB and 1.45 days and 2.48 days in GA, respectively (P <.01 for each). The amount of postoperative blood transfusion was less in UGNB (1242 ± 1036 vs 2264 ± 1298 mL, P <.01; and 147 ± 172 vs 352 ± 409, P =.01, respectively). Postoperative delirium occurred significantly less in UGNB (19.4% vs 48.4%; P =.02). No early mortality was seen in UGNB compared with one patient in GA (3.2%; P =.3). Early thrombosed graft was seen in two limbs (6.5%) in UGNB and in one limb in GA (3.2%), but was not significant. Conclusions: This is the first study of the usefulness of UGNB for IPABG. IPABG was technically accomplished for CLI patients with high-risk factors under UGNB. UGNB has advantages in intraoperative and postoperative managements in IPABG and could be a useful method to prevent operative complications for high-risk patients with CLI.

N2  - Objectives: Prior studies have shown that octogenarians have higher risk of mortality compared to nonoctogenarians undergoing open (OAR) and endovascular (EVAR) abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Fenestrated EVAR (F-EVAR) has been populated as a less invasive approach to treat patients with suboptimal neck anatomy with favorable outcomes compared to traditional OAR. The aim of the study was to compare 30-day outcomes of F-EVAR vs OAR in octogenarians undergoing repair of AAA involving visceral vessels in the United States. Methods: All patients with postoperative diagnosis of nonruptured AAA involving visceral vessels who underwent F-EVAR and OAR were identified in National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2006-2015). Primary outcome of interest was mortality. Secondary outcomes included renal failure, cardiopulmonary failure, and stroke. Univariate and multivariate analyses were implemented to examine 30-day postoperative mortality adjusting for patient demographics and comorbidities. Results: A total of 548 octogenarians underwent repair of nonruptured AAA involving the visceral vessels, of which 242 (44%) were F-EVARs and 306 (56%) were OARs. Octogenarians undergoing F-EVAR were on average 1 year older (mean age [standard deviation], 84.0 [3.1] vs 83.0 [2.8]; P <.001) and more likely to be males (82% vs 64%; P <.001) than patients undergoing OAR. Prevalence of diabetes (13% vs 6%; P =.005) and progressive renal failure (57% vs 47%; P =.02) was also higher in patients undergoing F-EVAR. Total length of hospital stay (11.7 [SD, 9.5] vs 4.5 [SD, 6.4] days; P =.01) and total operative time (243.2 [SD, 100.2] vs 208 [SD, 113.4] minutes; P =.0001) were higher in octogenarians undergoing OAR. Patients undergoing OAR also had more frequent return to the operating room (11% vs 5%; P =.02). Furthermore, 30-day postoperative mortality was higher after an OAR (8.5% vs 4.1%; P =.04). Secondary outcomes including cardiopulmonary (27% vs 6%; P <.001) and renal (16% vs 5%; P <.001) complications were also significantly higher in OAR compared to F-EVAR (Fig). After adjusting for patient demographics and comorbidities, OAR had more than 3.5-fold increase in 30-day postoperative mortality compared to F-EVAR (odds ratio, 3.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-9.64; P =.008). Other predictors of mortality were smoking history, bleeding disorders, sepsis, and acute renal failure/dialysis (Table). Conclusions: In this large national cohort of octogenarian patients undergoing repair of AAA involving the visceral vessels, we showed that OAR is associated with significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality compared to F-EVAR. These findings support the utilization of minimally invasive approach in this frail population. Further studies needed to evaluate the benefit of any repair in octogenarians.

N2  - Background: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney failure. Methods: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults with end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South America designed to examine the association between periodontitis and all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis. Participants were matched 1:1 on their propensity score for moderate to severe periodontitis assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries. Results: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score methods to generate a matched cohort of participants with periodontitis similar to those with none or mild periodontal disease, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were not changed substantially when participants were limited to those with 12 or more natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes of cardiovascular death. Conclusion: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of early death in adults treated with hemodialysis.

N2  - Background: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis and is traditionally measured using tools that assess physical impairment. Alternate measurement tools highlight cognitive and functional domains, requiring clinician, patient, and/or caregiver input. In this study, we compared frailty measures for incident dialysis patients that incorporate patient, clinician, and caregiver perspectives with an aim to contrast the measured prevalence of frailty using tools derived from different conceptual frameworks. Methods: A prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients was conducted between February 2014 and June 2015. Frailty was assessed at dialysis onset using: 1) modified definition of Fried Phenotype (Dialysis Morbidity Mortality Study definition, DMMS); 2) Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS); 3) Frailty Assessment Care Planning Tool (provides CFS grading, FACT-CFS); and 4) Frailty Index (FI). Measures were compared via correlation and sensitivity/specificity analyses. Results: A total of 98 patients participated (mean age of 61 ± 14 years). Participants were primarily Caucasian (91%), male (58%), and the majority started on hemodialysis (83%). The median score for both the CFS and FACT-CFS was 4 (interquartile range of 3-5). The mean FI score was 0.31 (standard deviation ± 0.16). The DMMS identified 78% of patients as frail. The FACT-CFS demonstrated highest correlation (r = 0.71) with the FI, while the DMMS was most sensitive (97%, 100%) and a CFS ≥ 5 most specific (100%, 77%) at corresponding FI cutoff values (>0.21, >0.45). Conclusions: Frailty assessments of incident dialysis patients that include clinician, caregiver and patient perspectives have moderate to strong correlation with the FI. At specified FI cutoff values, the FACT-CFS and DMMS are highly sensitive measures of frailty. The CFS and FACT-CFS may represent viable alternative screening tools in dialysis patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: There is increasing proportion of elderly people with marked physiological decline. Among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients under dialysis, Frailty is a common condition in these patients, and is considered a strong risk factor for morbidity and mortality. As ESRD is a growing health public problem with an increasing prevalence worldwide, and considering the lack of information about frailty in ESRD patients under online-hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF), this work aimed to evaluate the prevalence of frailty, and its association with sociodemographic, clinical and biochemical markers. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study with 97 ESRD patients (39.2% males; 69.86 ± 14.03 years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients on frailty was performed using the Tilburg Frailty Indicator. Data about sociodemographic variables and comorbidities, duration of dialysis, as well as hematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory markers were evaluated as possible associated variables. RESULTS: Our results showed a prevalence of frailty of 62.8% in our group of ESRD patients, being more prevalent in female patients (male - 45.5%, female - 72.0%, p = .021). A significant correlation between age and physical frailty score was found (r = .271; p = .009); however, no association was found between age and cognitive or social frailty scores. Patients with two or more chronic diseases showed higher prevalence of frailty (72.2% vs. 46.9%; p = .023). Moreover, we also found that ESRD patients living with a partner (41.0% vs. 80.9%; p < .001) as well as those eligible for renal transplant (70.4% vs. 44.8%; p = .033) showed lower prevalence of frailty. Multiple regression analysis identified civil status (beta = .260; p= .013), two or more chronic disease (beta=-0.302; p= 0.004) and not being eligible for renal transplant (beta=-0.209, p= .040) as independent variables significantly associated with global frailty score (R2 =.247). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our results confirm that frailty is a highly prevalent condition in ESRD patients under dialysis, and suggests its association with psychosocial and family determinants. As mortality is greater in frail ESRD patients, the identification of frail patients will be very important in order to enhance clinical outcomes.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Periodontitis, a multifactorial disease that involves inflammation of the structures supporting teeth, is common, treatable, and may be associated with mortality in the general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear whether periodontitis is associated with survival in the setting of kidney failure. METHODS: ORAL-D was a multinational cohort study involving 3338 dentate adults with end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South America. ORAL-D was designed to examine the associations between oral health and all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis. Propensity score methods were used to assemble a matched cohort of participants with moderate to severe periodontitis with characteristics similar to patients with no or mild periodontitis. Periodontal disease was assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries. RESULTS: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe periodontitis at baseline. Moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were not changed substantially in sensitivity analyses restricted to participants with 12 or more natural teeth or when analyses accounted for competing causes of cardiovascular death. CONCLUSIONS: Periodontitis does not appear to be associated with increased risks of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in adults treated with hemodialysis.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Older patients approaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) face the decision whether to start renal replacement therapy (RRT). Comprehensive conservative care (CCC) is argued to be a reasonable alternative as RRT has not always been shown to benefit older and often frail patients in terms of survival. To truly improve counselling, adequate data on other important outcomes like quality of life (QOL) are needed. Our aim was to compare QOL in older renal patients with either CCC or RRT. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, single-center cohort study in 96 patients with ESRD aged ≥70 years old and who had chosen CCC (n=23) or RRT (n=73) after carefull counselling. The RRT patients were subdivided into patients not yet started with dialysis (RRT group A, n=39) and patients started with dialysis (RRT group B, n=34). Patients were examined on QOL using the KDQOL-SFTM questionnaire. Physical and Mental Component Summary scores (PCS; MCS) as well as 8 kidney disease-targeted domain scores were calculated. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess whether treatment pathway was independently associated with PCS and MCS scores. RESULTS: In RRT patients not yet started with dialysis (RRT group A), the PCS and MCS scores were higher compared to the CCC group (PCS:mean6 SD; 56.0 ±20.6 versus 40.2 ± 16.2; p = 0.003;MCS: 68.5± 17.2 versus 54.2± 19.7; p = 0.004). Patients who had started dialysis (RRT group B) did not differ from CCC patients on PCS and MCS scores neither in the crude analysis (PCS: 48.1 ±20.9 versus 40.2± 16.2; p = 0.14; MCS: 62.0± 22.0 versus 54.2± 19.7; p = 0.18), nor in multivariable regression (PCS: p = 0.76;MCS: p = 0.68). In the 8 kidney disease-specific domains, patients in RRT group A scored higher on 5 kidney disease-specific domains compared to CCC patients, whilst RRT group B patients scored higher on 3 domains compared to CCC patients. In the domain Burden of kidney disease, CCC patients had higher scores compared to RRT group B patients (median; 25th to 75th percentiles: 75.0, 56.3 - 81.3 versus 43.8, 25.0 - 62.5; p = 0.001). No differences were observed in the other domain scores. CONCLUSIONS: Patients choosing CCC had similar quality of life scores compared to patients who had started dialysis. In patients choosing dialysis but not yet started, quality of life scores were higher compared to CCC patients. This provides important information to improve counselling older patients with ESRD.

N2  - Introduction and Objectives: Despite an aggressive climate of limb salvage and revascularization, 7% of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) undergo major lower extremity amputation (LEA). The purpose of this study was to describe the current demographics of patients undergoing major LEA in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI). Methods: The VQI amputation registry was reviewed to identify patients who underwent major LEAs. Patient factors, limb characteristics, procedure type, and intraoperative variables were analyzed by level of amputation using chi-square analysis for significance with associated pvalues. Results: Between 2013-2015, 3,180 major LEAs were completed with a BKA:AKA ratio of 1.29:1. Mean age was 66 years, 85% living at home prior to admission, and 68% ambulatory. Co-morbidities included diabetes (67%), CAD (32%), ESRD (22%), and COPD (23%). Mean ABI was 0.78, with 28% history of ipsilateral revascularization. Indications were ischemic rest pain or tissue loss (58%), uncontrolled infection (31%), acute ischemia (9%), and neuropathic tissue loss (2%). Post-operatively, 28% were discharged home, complication rate was 16%, and 30-day mortality 6%. Patients who received an AKA vs BKA were more likely female (40.45% vs 31.67%), >70 years (47.95% vs. 32.81%), underweight (18.42% vs. 9.34%), non-ambulatory (40.41% vs 25.11%), ASA class >3 (53.84% vs 43.78%), ABI <0.6 (58.38% vs. 43.78%), and non-private insurance (77.88% vs 69.5%). Patients undergoing AKA were less likely to have post-operative complications (13% vs 18%), but had higher 30-day mortality (9% vs 5%)(All P<0.001). Conclusions: In the VQI registry, major LEA was performed predominantly for ischemic rest pain and tissue loss with a BKA:AKA ratio of 1.29:1. Patients undergoing AKA vs BKA were older, more frail, had lower ABI, fewer post-operative complications, but higher 30-day mortality. This registry offers an important real world resource for studies pertaining to vascular surgery patients undergoing major lower extremity amputation.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a deleterious event that may cause adverse long-term outcomes such as progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), urgent need of dialysis or death. As life expectancy continues to improve, very elderly (≥ 80 years) patients become more prevalent with growing comorbidities and reduced renal reserve which make them more frail and vulnerable to any organ insult. We aimed to determine the predictors of mortality in the very elderly submitted to AKI. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 140 patients aged ≥ 80 years old who were admitted with AKI (measured as an increase in ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5-2x their baseline creatinine). Patients were followed up to 30 days after discharge. Baseline variables, Charlson score index (CSI) and laboratory data were collected. Patients with stage 5 CKD were excluded. RESULTS: One-hundred forty patients with a mean age of 86 6 4 years (80-98) were included. More than half (59%, n=83) were female, 48% (n=67) were in nursing homes and 59% (n=83) had a CSI ≥ 8. Diabetes mellitus were observed in 35% (n=49) and 21% (n=30) were previous smokers. Infection-related complications were observed in 68% (n=95) patients and hypotensive events in 57% (n=80). Median time of hospitalization was 12 (IQ [7-20) days. Mean baseline serum creatinine (SCr) was 2.1 ± 1.2 mg/dL and mean admission Scr was 6.1 ± 2.6 mg/dL. Oliguria (<400mL/24h) was present in 28% (n=39) of patients. Mean admission serum albumin was 2.7 ± 0.6 g/dL. Out of 104 (74%) patients who were discharged, 43% (n=60) recovered renal function with a mean SCr of 3.1 ± 1.7 mg/dL and 31% (n=44) become dialysis-dependent. Thirty-six (26%) patients died, 29 (21%) during hospitalization and 7 (5%) over the next 30 days. Those who survived presented with a mean SCr at 30 days of 2.7 ± 1.7 mg/dL. The main cause of death was sepsis (n=23, 64%) either from respiratory or urinary foci, followed by malignancy (n=7, 19%) and cardiovascular events (n=6, 17%). In a logistical regression model adjusted for age and sex, independent predictors of mortality were living nursing home (OR 7.466 [2.852-19.544], p<0.001), CSI ≥ 8 (OR 3.475 [1.325-9.116], p=0.011) and sepsis whether at admission or during hospitalization (OR 3.135 [1.222-8.046], p=0.017). CONCLUSIONS: We found that a higher Charlson index score, the need of living in a nursing home and the diagnosis of sepsis whether at admission or during hospitalization were independent predictors of mortality in very elderly patients. These findings alert us to the fragility of this particular group of individuals.

N2  - BACKGROUND Older adults with multiple co-morbidities and impaired functional status are at very high risk for complications related to limb ischemia and amputation in peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Deciding if and when to perform amputation is very challenging in older patients given poor outcomes. CASE DESCRIPTION The following three cases highlight the heterogeneity and complexity surrounding these high risk surgical decisions. For all of these cases, endovascular revascularization was either performed and unsuccessful or unable to be performed. An 80 year old woman with PVD presented with necrotic toe ulcerations and osteomyelitis. Despite her increasing pain in her feet and her willingness to undergo toe amputation in order to diminish her pain, podiatry declined to perform the amputation, citing her comorbidities which include ESRD and breast cancer, as well as poor wound healing abilities which would certainly lead to poor outcomes. One month later, she returned to another hospital where they performed a palliative transmetatarsal amputation, but she died shortly thereafter. A 65 year old woman with PVD and diabetic nephropathy was diagnosed with a non-healing right foot ulceration with osteomyelitis. The patient had already undergone below-knee amputation (BKA) 5 years prior on the left leg, and had fair functional activity with her unilateral prosthesis. Despite her poor prognosis and comorbidities (which included CKD stage V), a right BKA was performed. She continues to have a very prolonged, slow recovery process related to her bilateral amputations, but she is alive and doing well. A 70 year old man with PVD and remote history of left BKA had a prolonged hospitalization related to non-healing right foot ulceration and osteomyelitis. At first, decision was to proceed with non-surgical conservative management, given poor functional status (mostly wheelchair bound) and hesitation to proceed with a second amputation. However, his clinical condition deteriorated and surgery performed emergent right BKA. He later died of multi-organ system failure despite all attempts to prolong his life. DISCUSSION The decision to amputate in patients with limb ischemia is not straightforward, especially in a complex, old, frail population. Recent guidelines should help interdisciplinary teams, including experienced vascular surgeons and geriatricians, carefully consider all variables before proceeding with treatment options.

N2  - Introduction: Herpes zoster (shingles) occurs commonly in the elderly on account of declining cellular immunity and reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) acquired earlier in life. Appropriate treatment of herpes zoster can reduce the risk of developing further complications. Despite treatment, complications may still occur when there are other conditions present that lead to an immunosuppressed state. Case: An 83 year old male was admitted to the Community Living Center(CLC) after an acute care hospital admission. His past medical history was significant for ESRD on HD; CHF, Pulmonary HTN, Vitamin D Def, HIV with Last CD4 count 519 and Type 2 Diabetes. The patient's neurological examination revealed mild cognitive impairment. It was noted that the patient was no longer taking antiretroviral medication (ART) and an appointment was made for him to be seen in the infectious disease clinic. Shortly after admission, he complained of pain in his back and abdomen. Physical examination revealed a maculopapular rash in a dermatomal distribution extending from the left side of his back to the infra umbilical area of his abdomen. A diagnosis was made of herpes zoster and he was started on Tramadol as needed for pain and Val acyclovir (1 g three times per day for 7 days. A few days later the patient was noticed to be confused and was trying to get out of bed. It was initially thought that the mental status changes were as a result of the tramadol which was discontinued. The patient was subsequently transferred to an acute hospital where a lumbar puncture was performed, CSF analysis showed WBC 35, RBC 58, glucose 50 and protein 142. Herpes encephalitis was later confirmed. He was started on IV ceftriaxone, acyclovir, vancomycin, ampicillin and placed on respiratory support. However his clinical condition continued to deteriorate and he was sent back to the CLC for Hospice care where he died peacefully. Discussion: HSV-1 encephalitis should be considered when mental status changes occur in patients soon after a diagnosis of zoster. This is particularly important in patients with risk factors such as impaired cell mediated immunity. Prompt diagnosis with CSF evaluation and early antiviral therapy with intravenous acyclovir is particularly important as studies have shown that a delay of greater than two days between presentation to the hospital and initiation of acyclovir therapy is associated with poor outcomes.

N2  - Purpose of review Patients reaching end-stage kidney disease face difficult decisions, including choosing among renal replacement therapies (RRTs). With an increasingly elderly and frail population, there is growing interest in conservative kidney management (CKM) as a viable alternative to dialysis. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a patient-centered approach to these decisions, in which choices are viewed within the explicitly discussed values and preferences of the patient. Patient decision aids (PDAs) are tools designed to facilitate these discussions. The choice between dialysis and CKM is particularly complex, given the poor prognostication data for CKM. This is an emerging area for PDAs in nephrology. This review highlights care gaps around SDM for dialysis versus CKM, presents current PDAs for making choices about RRTs and CKM and discusses exciting new work around the development of novel PDAs. Recent findings Many PDAs have been created recently, primarily to help with decisions about RRTs. Three new PDAs are in testing phases to aid with the more complex decision of choosing between dialysis and CKM. Summary International nephrology communities are moving toward improved SDM with their patients and PDAs are being developed to facilitate this process.

N2  - Objective: There has been recent interest in using Frailty to predict outcomes in surgical patients. A simplified form of the original Frailty index from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging has been established as the modified frailty index (mFI). In our study we have sought to apply the mFI to infrainguinal vascular bypasses and to predict outcomes. Methods: The 2010 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACSNSQIP) database was used: patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial bypass surgery were identified We used an mFI with 11 variables, based on mapping the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index to the NSQIP comorbidities. A bivariate and multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression analysis. Factors associated with increased risk of mortality were identified. Results: A total of 4,704 patients (64% Males, 36% Females) underwent infrainguinal arterial bypass. Incidence of post operative myocardial infarct: 1% (For MFI:0-0.9) vs. 4%; mortality: 0.6% (For MFI:0-0.9) vs. 7.4% (For MFI 0.54-0.63); Renal failure 0.58% (For MFI 0-0.09) vs. 0.83% (For MFI 0.54-0.63) and graft failure 4.8% (For MFI 0-0.09) vs. 7.4% (For MFI 0.54-0.63). Following factors were associated with increased 30-day mortality: Age>80 years (OR 9), ASA Class 4 (OR 27), emergency operation (OR 3.4), dialysis (OR 5.1), stroke (OR 11), sepsis (OR 4.5) Acute renal failure (OR 31). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the mFI can be used as a valuable tool to identify patients at a higher risk for post operative morbidity and mortality after lower extremity revascularization. Higher mFI predicts increased risk of post operative complications. It can be used as a screening tool to identify patients who are at a high risk for developing complications.

N2  - Purpose of review In this article, we review sarcopenia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We aim to present how definitions of sarcopenia from the general population may pertain to those with CKD, its assessment by clinicians and emerging therapies for sarcopenia in CKD. For this review, we limit our description and recommendations to patients with CKD who are not on dialysis. Recent findings Poorer parameters of lean mass, strength and physical function are associated with worsening patientcentered outcomes such as limiting mobility, falls and mortality in CKD; however, the magnitude of these associations are different in those with and without CKD. Sarcopenia in CKD is a balance between skeletal muscle regeneration and catabolism, which are both altered in the uremic environment. Multiple pathways are involved in these derangements, which are briefly reviewed. Differences between commonly used terms cachexia, frailty, protein-energy wasting, dynapenia and sarcopenia are described. Therapeutic options in predialysis CKD are not well studied; therefore, we review exercise options and emerging pharmacological therapies. Summary Sarcopenia, now with its own International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code, is of importance clinically and should be accounted for in research studies in patients with CKD. Multiple therapies for sarcopenia are in development and will hopefully be available for our patients in the future.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: It is recognised that a large amount of AKI occurs in the community thus there is a need for measures for early identification, prevention and management in primary care1. In April 2016 routine reporting of AKI with a serum creatinine result was rolled out to Primary care with the aim of alerting GPs to assist the delivery of optimum care2.We have previously described the mortality rate and demonstrated that there is an increased risk of death with AKI managed entirely in the community3.The aim was to establish the cause of death in patients who are managed in the community with AKI and whether the death can be attributed to AKI. METHODS: The data was taken from the regional data base, collected over a 6-month period, all patients aged >18 who had had a serum creatinine requested by a GP in our region over February to August 2009, we identified those who had died within 30 days of serum creatinine being reported by the laboratory. Cause and place of death was ascertained using records from the Office for National Statistics by matching NHS number and date of death. Primary cause of death and underlying secondary cause of death were then categorised using ICD 10 codes. RESULTS: 4432 deaths occurred during the study period, 165 (52% male) occurred within 30 days of the serum creatinine result. 93 patients had AKI. Table 1 shows mean age, number and percentage of deaths within 30 days by stage of AKI. Cause of death by stage of AKI is shown in Figure 1. None of the patients had AKI recorded as the primary or underlying cause of death. Of the 93 patients with AKI, 78 (84%) had a severe chronic illness or were on an end of life pathway based on cause or place of death; 5 (5%) died in nursing/residential care (mean age 88), suggesting they had been frail; 10 (11%) died in hospital: 5 had been admitted electively for major surgery and 5 died in Accident and Emergency prior to being admitted acutely with a condition unrelated to AKI. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that 30 day mortality rate increases with worse AKI stage and 89 % of patients who died with AKI in the community were frail, had a severe chronic illness, or were on an end of life pathway. The remaining 11% died of an acute event not related to AKI. This suggests that the decisions to manage some people with AKI in the community are appropriate in our region. (Table Presented).

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is widely prevalent worldwide, with a special impact on elderly population. Around half of people aged over 75 meet diagnostic criteria for CKD according to the recent ‘Kidney disease improving global outcomes’ (KDIGO) 2012 clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of CKD. However, geriatric patients have characteristics that may not be addressed by general guidelines. Therefore, it is important to know the natural history of the disease, symptoms, and ‘red-flags’ that could help in the management of these patients. In this review, a complete approach is presented on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of CKD in the geriatric population.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Maintenance dialysis patients display reduced physical activity which is associated with worse outcomes in this population. We aimed to evaluate the relation of physical activity levels with clinical outcomes in Korean dialysis patients. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from 27 dialysis centers according to the inclusion criteria, who were aged ≥20 years old, on dialysis ≥6 months, able to walk with or without assistive devices and had no hospitalization history for the previous 3 months, except for vascular access problems in hemodialysis patients. A total of 2,737 participants were assessed and finally 1,611 participants (1,247 hemodialysis and 364 peritoneal dialysis patients) were included. These were divided into 3 groups (Inactive group, Intermediate group and Active group) according to the frequency, intensity and time of regular physical activity which were assessed by standardized questions. RESULTS: The proportions of patients with frailty and the presence of each component decreased as physical activity increased. The proportions of participants with disability in the Inactive, Intermediate, and Active groups were 171 (23.5%), 93 (17.9%), and 40 (11.0%), respectively (P < 0.001). The mean numbers of disability components (means ± SE) were 0.46 ± 0.04 in the Inactive group, 0.33 ± 0.04 in the Intermediate group, and 0.18 ± 0.03 in the Active group (P < 0.001). The multivariate analysis showed similar results (0.48 ± 0.03 in the Inactive group, 0.32 ± 0.04 in the Intermediate group, and 0.15 ± 0.04 in the Active group; P < 0.001). The number of participants with a history of fall during the last 12 months was 149 (20.5%) in the Inactive group, 88 (16.9%) in the Intermediate group, and 48 (13.2%) in the Active group (P = 0.011). Physical component scale (PCS) scores in the Inactive, Intermediate, and Active group were 55.0 ± 21.6, 64.0 ± 18.3, and 69.1 ± 17.9, respectively (P < 0.001). Mental components scale (MCS) scores in the Inactive, Intermediate, and Active group were 54.5 ± 20.6, 60.8 ± 19.3, and 64.6 ± 20.2, respectively (P < 0.001). PCS and MCS scores increased as physical activity increased. All-cause and cardiovascular disease-related mortality at 500 days tended to increase as physical activity reduces, but showed no statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Higher level of physical activity was associated with less prevalence of frailty, disability, fall and lower level of health-related quality of life. We should pay more attention to physical activity in the management of dialysis patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Tunnelled central venous catheters are increasingly used as vascular access on chronic hemodialysis patients, especially those who are elderly and frail. Catheter use is associated with increased risk of infection, inadequate blood flow and dialysis efficacy, thrombosis and decreased survival. The solution used to fill the lumens of the catheter (lock) is associated with catheters patency, risk of infection and need for replacement. It is not known whether the weekly administration of Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rtPA) into the catheter lumens and of citrate on the remainder sessions of dialysis is associated with better catheter patency when compared with citrate alone. METHODS: A prospective randomized cross-over study was performed. 16 patients were followed through two 24-week periods separated by a 4 week wash-out period (total follow up period: 13 months). On the first period the catheter lumens were filled with citrate IntraLock®(Fresenius Medical Care) and with 1mg per lumen of rtPA (Actilyse®, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals) on the mid-week session. On the second period citrate was used on all dialysis sessions. After completing the first period, the patients completed a wash-out period with heparin 5000UI/mL and were switched to the alternative lock scheme. RESULTS: Eight patients completed the two observation periods. Blood flow rate was significantly higher on the rtPA group (380,73±33,43 mL/min versus 368,86±34,86 mL/min; p-value <0.001) with a mean increase on the random-effects model after adjustment for time of 13,79 mL/min (95% CI 10,23-17,34 mL/min). There was no increase of hemorrhagic events with the use of rtPA. CONCLUSIONS: On a prospective randomized cross-over study, the weekly use of rtPA as lock solution on tunneled catheters of hemodialysis was associated with increased catheter blood flow. As no increase of hemorrhagic events was observed, this intervention appears to be safe.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Fried and colleagues described a frailty phenotype. This phenotype is manifest with 3 or more of the following: low grip strength, low energy, slowed waking speed, low physical activity, or unintentional weight loss. Frailty has been associated with disability and hospitalization among older individuals. In these analyses, we aimed to assess whether frailty impacts death and ESRD development among individuals with CKD and whether it alters the impact of primary care on these outcomes. METHODS: We quantified the association between primary care utilization and ESRD incidence or death among older US adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 2005-2006 using Medicare claims. We previously developed the Claims Based Frailty Index (CFI) which allows frailty to be detected with claims data alone. We generated the CFI for each individual using diagnosis codes from their claims data from the preceding 6 months. We used Cox proportional hazard models and competing risk models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for ESRD and mortality including our measure of frailty in the models and in stratified analyses, and tested the impact of a PCP visit on these outcomes. RESULTS: Among 106,765 individuals, 4,264 patients developed ESRD and 45,059 died over four years. Most (79%) had at least one primary care visit in 2006. The presence of frailty was an independent predictor of the outcomes of death [HR 1.14 (95% CI 1.15-1.25)] and ESRD [HR 1.50 (95% CI 1.48- 1.58)], after extensive adjustment for comorbid conditions. Compared to patients with no PCP visits, patients with at least one visit had a lower risk of death [HR 0.73 (95%CI 0.72-0.75)] overall and in age stratified models. The benefits of a PCP visit on averting mortality were equivalent among frail and non-frail individuals, HR 0.74 (95% CI. 0.71-0.78) and HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.77), respectively. In the competing risk model, a PCP visit did not significantly reduce ESRD incidence [HR 0.93(95% CI 0.87-1.0)]; PCP involvement benefited neither frail nor non-frail individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is an independent predictor of death and ESRD among older individuals with CKD. PCP involvement in the care of frail and non-frail individuals with CKD lessens the risk of death, non-differentially, but not the risk of ESRD. The impact of primary care is likely through modification of comorbid conditions associated with death. We found that frailty status did not alter the impact of primary care on outcomes among patients with chronic renal insufficiency.

N2  - Background: The Fried frailty phenotype, a measure of physiologic reserve, is associated with poor kidney transplant (KT) outcomes. However, it was developed in community-dwelling older adults and might not be ideal for KT assessment. Some Fried components may not apply to KT patients, and some ESRD-specific aspects of frailty may not be captured in the Fried phenotype. Examining existing and identifying novel components are necessary to characterize frailty and tailor interventions among pre-KT patients. Methods: We elicited opinions on frailty from clinicians treating KT candidates (nephrologists, transplant surgeons and gerontologists) at JHU in a 2-round consensus-building Delphi study (round 1 n=41; round 2 n=36; response rate 87%) and from 91 KT candidates (response rate 97%). Results: Clinicians were more likely than patients to say ESRD makes patients frail (p=<0.001 Table 1); older patients were less likely than younger patients to say ESRD makes patients frail (p=0.01). 3.3% of patients self-identified as frail; 19.3% measured as frail. 3.3% of patients have been told their frailty status; 61.8% of patients want to be told. Clinicians agreed on what constitutes frailty in ESRD patients. Clinicians were more likely to say that 4/5 frailty components were relevant to ESRD patients (Table 2). Clinicians identified 10 new ESRD-specific frailty components. Gerontologists were less likely to want to add cognition and history of falls (Table 2). Clinicians and patients agreed that patients would be interested in interventions, and that foot-peddlers would make ESRD patients less frail (Table 1) (Table presented). Conclusions: Opinions on frailty in KT candidates differed between patients and clinicians, but all agreed that KT candidates would be interested in interventions that could improve frailty in this population.

N2  - Depression is the most prevalent mental health illness in ESRD patients. Physical frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is associated with depressive symptoms. They are both associated with adverse KT outcomes and may have a synergistic effect when present together. METHODS: Depressive symptoms and the Fried frailty phenotype were measured among 641 adult KT recipients upon KT admission to Johns Hopkins Hospital (12/08-05/16). Depressive symptoms were assessed using a modified Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) in which two exhaustion questions were omitted due to overlap with a frailty component, resulting in a 14.4 score cutoff out of 54. Using adjusted survival analysis and Poisson regression, we tested whether depressive symptoms and frailty were associated with mortality and death-censored graft loss, as well as length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Among KT recipients, 8.9% exhibited depressive symptoms and 17.8% were frail. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with frailty using the CES-D (OR=5.36, 95%CI:3.03-9.46, p<0.001). Frail KT recipients exhibiting depressive symptoms were at a higher risk of death-censored graft loss and a longer LOS than their non-frail and depressed counterparts (Table 1). CONCLUSION: Depressive symptoms are more likely to be present in adult ESRD patients who are frail. Together, depression and frailty contribute to a higher risk of graft loss, a longer LOS, and possibly mortality. KT recipients who are both depressed and frail should be closely monitored in order to improve KT outcomes (Table presented). (Figur presented).

N2  - Purpose: To design and implement a frailty assessment and optimization program addressing potential modifiable risk factors that would ordinarily disqualify patients from kidney and/or pancreas transplant candidacy. Methods: Our Training for Transplant (T4T) program incorporates a comprehensive frailty assessment into initial evaluation for kidney and/or pancreas transplant referrals which includes the Hopkins Frailty Assessment, a Frailty Deficit Index, BMI, and waist-hip ratio measurement. Potential recipients outside our transplant criteria by BMI and/or frailty are offered referral to our multidisciplinary T4T clinic. Patients then follow-up at 3 to 6 month intervals with repeat measurements, and are seen by a transplant surgeon, dietitian and wait-list coordinator. Activity and dietary logs are reviewed; current challenges to candidacy along with goal setting and dietary, social and exercise counseling are provided. T4T participation continues, contingent on documented progress or steady state, until transplant or deemed “not a candidate”. We retrospectively reviewed our pilot T4T experience (July 2014-June 2016) including evaluation, T4T participation and successful listing and transplant of enrolled patients. Results: 260 patients completed an initial kidney transplant evaluation (Fig 1). 135 patients were deemed outside of listing criteria. 31% of these patients were referred to the T4T clinic. All of these patients were obese or frail and 12% were both. 6 of 9 patients with Hopkins score to >3 improved to normal scores; 1 worsened. eight fluctuated for all patients, however worsening Hopkins score was not observed with weight change. 52% of these T4T patients went on to be listed and 41% were transplanted. There was 100% short term graft and patient survival for both groups. Conclusions: A multidisciplinary T4T program addressing frailty and obesity can facilitate kidney waitlist candidacy and successful transplant with good patient and graft survival. Our pilot experience suggests that BMI and frailty are modifiable risk factors in ESRD patients. Further work is warranted to investigate the role of patient self-selection and provider intervention (Figur presented).

N2  - Background: Frailty and decreased physical performance are associated with poor outcomes after kidney transplant. Less is known about their relationship with pretransplant outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize associations between frailty and physical performance with death on the kidney transplant waiting list. Methods: Since 12/2014, kidney transplant candidates at our center deemed “highrisk” (age > 59, diabetic and/or history of > 3 years dialysis) have undergone frailty and physical performance testing during their pre-transplant evaluations. Patients who were evaluated and approved for transplant since then were retrospectively analyzed and censored at the time of transplant. Frailty was measured using Fried Criteria, and physical performance testing was obtained using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) which provides a composite measure of balance, gait speed and chair stand time. SPPB scores range from 0 (unable to perform) to 12 (no difficulty performing). Results: Between 12/2014 and 11/2016, 486 high-risk candidates were evaluated and approved for kidney transplant at our center. Mean age was 60 ± 11, 61% were male, 52% were diabetic 80% were Caucasian and 60% required dialysis. Of these patients, 292 (60%) underwent frailty and physical performance testing. 13% of patients were frail. Mean SPPB score in frail patients was 8.9 ± 3.3, whereas mean SPPB score in non-frail patients was 11.4 ± 1.3 (p<0.0001). After waitlisting, 10 patients died. Mean time from evaluation to death was 9 ± 6 months. Frail patients were more likely to die on the waiting list compared to nonfrail patients (8% vs 1%, p=0.01). Patients with a SPPB score < 10 were also more likely to die on the waiting list compared to patients with a higher SPPB score (9% vs 1%, p=0.01). The relationship between frailty, SPPB score < 10 and death on the waiting list was independent of age, diabetes, duration of dialysis or cardiac troponin T. Discussion: Frail kidney transplant candidates have worse physical performance. Both frailty and decreased physical performance are associated with death on the waiting list. Further studies are needed to determine whether improving frailty and physical performance prior to transplant can improve survival on the waiting list.

N2  - Reduced functional capacity (FC) is associated with poor outcomes and early hospital readmission after kidney transplant (KT). The aim of the study was to determine if objective and subjective measures of FC are congruent and associated with outcomes after KT. Medical records of patients who received a KT at a single center were reviewed. At the time of transplant FC was obtained by: 1)Short Form 4a PROMIS survey on physical function and 2)hand-grip (HG) strength measurement using the Jamar dynamometer. The average of 2 grip tests was used for analysis. Patients were defined as frail if either of the following occurred: 1) >-1 standard deviation (SD) below normative range on HG testing, 2)scored < 12 on the survey. There were 58 patients with a mean age of 50.8 years. 21 patients (36.2%) were within normative range for HG strength and 37 (63.8%) fell >-1 SD below normative range. 39 patients (67.2%) scored > 13 on the survey while 19 (32.8%) scored < 12. Among patients with frail HG strength, 23 had a survey score of > 13 (62.2%). Among patients with a survey score of > 13, 23 (59.0%) had a frail HG test. Rehospitalization rate within the first 90 days was 32.4% in the frail HG group vs. 19.0% in the non-frail HG group. Re-hospitalization rate within the first 90 days was 18.9% in the frail survey group vs. 42.9% in the non-frail survey group (Figur presented). Self-reported assessments of frailty do not appear to correlate with an objective measure in KT recipients. KT recipients tend to overestimate their FC. An objective measurement of frailty may be more accurate in pedicting early readmission rate after KT. A larger cohort of patients should be fllowed to confirm these preliminary findings and to determine if patient mortality is crrelated with objective and/or subjective measures of frailty.

N2  - The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes over the last decade has resulted in increasing numbers of frail older patients with a combination of these conditions. Current treatment guidelines may not necessarily be relevant for such patients, who are mostly excluded from the trials upon which these recommendations are based. There is a paucity of data upon which to base the management of older patients with CKD. Nearly all current guidelines recommend less-tight glycaemic control for the older population, citing the lack of proven medium-term benefits and concerns about the high shortterm risk of hypoglycaemia. However, reports from large landmark trials have shown potential benefits for both microvascular and macrovascular complications, though the relevance of these findings to this specific population is uncertain. The trials have also highlighted potential alternative explanations for the hazards of intensive glycaemic control. These include depression, low endogenous insulin reserve, low body mass index and side effects of the medication. Over the last few years, newer classes of hypoglycaemic drugs with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia have emerged. This article aims to present a balanced view of advantages and disadvantages of intense glycaemic control in this group of patients, which we hope will help the clinician and patient to come to an individualized management approach.

N2  - Frailty is common in kidney transplant (KT) recipients with a prevalence of 20%, and is associated with post-KT adverse events including mortality, DGF, early hospital readmissions and longer length of stay. Polypharmacy is frequent among frail older adults without ESRD. However, the association between number of medications and frailty among KT recipients is unclear. 738 participants were enrolled in a prospective cohort at the time of KT (12/2008-6/2016) and frailty status was measured immediately prior to KT. The number of prescription medications in the year before KT was analyzed as a count; polypharmacy was defined as 5-9 prescription medications, and hyperpolypharmacy as ≥ 10 prescription medications. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between polypharmacy and frailty after adjusting for age, race, gender, BMI, donor type, time on dialysis and primary diagnosis. The median number of medications in the year prior to KT was 5 (IQR, 0-10). 19.1% of the KT recipients had polypharmacy, while 28.2% of them had hyperpolypharmacy. Each additional prescribed medication was associated with 1.04-fold (95% CI, 1.01-1.07; p=0.013) increased odds of frailty at KT. Polypharmacy was associated with a 1.70-fold (95% CI, 1.01-2.88; p=0.047) higher odds of frailty at KT, and hyperpolypharmacy associated with a 2.30-fold (95% CI, 1.45-3.66; p=<0.001) higher odds (Table presented). Anti-coagulants, pain control medications, or psychiatric/mental health medications were associated with a greater odds of frailty at KT (Figur presented). Frailty was more common among KT recipients with polypharmacy in the 1 year prior to KT. Individual classes of medications such as anti-coagulants, pain control medications, or psychiatric/mental health medications were also associated with a higher odds of frailty. Reducing medication use may help in halting or even reversing the development of frailty in KT recipients.

N2  - Aim: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms and the interventions. Methods: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the keywords “Cognitive and CKD” and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) with the keywords “Frailty and CKD” were included in final analysis. Results: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population. Conclusions: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease.

N2  - Background Partial nephrectomy (PN) is the reference standard of management for a cT1a renal mass. However, its role in the management of larger tumors (cT1b and cT2) is still under scrutiny. Objective To conduct a meta-analysis assessing functional, oncologic, and perioperative outcomes of PN and radical nephrectomy (RN) in the specific case of larger renal tumors (≥cT1b). The primary endpoint was an overall analysis of cT1b and cT2 masses. The secondary endpoint was a sensitivity analysis for cT2 only. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature review was performed up to December 2015 using multiple search engines to identify eligible comparative studies. A formal meta-analysis was performed for studies comparing PN to RN for both cT1b and cT2 tumors. In addition, a sensitivity analysis including the subgroup of studies comparing PN to RN for cT2 only was conducted. Pooled estimates were calculated using a fixed-effects model if no significant heterogeneity was identified; alternatively, a random-effects model was used when significant heterogeneity was detected. For continuous outcomes, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was used as summary measure. For binary variables, the odds ratio (OR) or risk ratio (RR) was calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager 5 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Evidence synthesis Overall, 21 case-control studies including 11 204 patients (RN 8620; PN 2584) were deemed eligible and included in the analysis. Patients undergoing PN were younger (WMD −2.3 yr; p < 0.001) and had smaller masses (WMD −0.65 cm; p < 0.001). Lower estimated blood loss was found for RN (WMD 102.6 ml; p < 0.001). There was a higher likelihood of postoperative complications for PN (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.34–2.2; p < 0.001). Pathology revealed a higher rate of malignant histology for the RN group (RR 0.97; p = 0.02). PN was associated with better postoperative renal function, as shown by higher postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; WMD 12.4 ml/min; p < 0.001), lower likelihood of postoperative onset of chronic kidney disease (RR 0.36; p < 0.001), and lower decline in eGFR (WMD −8.6 ml/min; p < 0.001). The PN group had a lower likelihood of tumor recurrence (OR 0.6; p < 0.001), cancer-specific mortality (OR 0.58; p = 0.001), and all-cause mortality (OR 0.67; p = 0.005). Four studies compared PN (n = 212) to RN (n = 1792) in the specific case of T2 tumors (>7 cm). In this subset of patients, the estimated blood loss was higher for PN (WMD 107.6 ml; p < 0.001), as was the likelihood of complications (RR 2.0; p < 0.001). Both the recurrence rate (RR 0.61; p = 0.004) and cancer-specific mortality (RR 0.65; p = 0.03) were lower for PN. Conclusions PN is a viable treatment option for larger renal tumors, as it offers acceptable surgical morbidity, equivalent cancer control, and better preservation of renal function, with potential for better long-term survival. For T2 tumors, PN use should be more selective, and specific patient and tumor factors should be considered. Further investigation, ideally in a prospective randomized fashion, is warranted to better define the role of PN in this challenging clinical scenario. Patient summary We performed a cumulative analysis of the literature to determine the best treatment option in cases of localized kidney tumor of higher clinical stage (T1b and T2, as based on preoperative imaging). Our findings suggest that removing only the tumor and saving the kidney might be an effective treatment modality in terms of cancer control, with the advantage of preserving the kidney function. However, a higher risk of perioperative complications should be taken into account when facing larger tumors (clinical stage T2) with kidney-sparing surgery.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although undocumented immigrants can receive emergency dialysis in the US regardless of their ability to pay, most states do not provide them with subsidized care for renal transplantation, a more cost effective form of renal replacement therapy that provides better outcomes for patients. The objective of the study was to determine whether undocumented immigrants have similar outcomes to U.S. citizens after receiving kidney transplants covered by Medicaid. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we identified from the United States Renal Data System and followed for 5 years all adult patients on Medicaid who received their first kidney transplant from 1990-2011 and categorized them by citizenship status. We applied Cox proportional hazards frailty models with transplant center as a random effect to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all-cause graft loss. RESULTS: Of 10,495 patients, 8660 (82%) were U.S. citizens, 1489 (14%) were permanent residents, and 346 (3%) were undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants were younger, healthier, on dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a living donor. 71% were transplanted in California, and 61% were transplanted after 2005. We identified 42 graft failures in undocumented immigrants (3.7/100 person-years) and 2,445 in U.S. citizens (7.9/100 person-years). Undocumented immigrants had a lower unadjusted risk of graft loss compared to US citizens (HR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still significant when adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, dialysis, and transplant-related factors (HR 0.67, 95%CI: 0.46- 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Only 3% of patients with Medicaid transplanted in the US were undocumented immigrants. The transplants occurred mostly in California, have increased in recent years, and our study suggests that they do no worse, and perhaps even better, than US citizens. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for kidney transplantation in undocumented immigrants is it leads to high quality outcomes while lowering the overall costs of renal replacement therapy in these patients.

N2  - Background: The long-term management of patients with coexistent severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and liver cirrhosis constitute a real challenge. Because, severe AR is a contraindication for solid organ transplantation and liver cirrhosis convey high risk of mortality for surgical aortic valve (AV) replacement (AVR). Therefore, these patients are often declined for life-saving surgical treatment options. Case: A 56-year-old female with a history of AR and liver cirrhosis secondary to nonalcoholic steohepatitis presented to our center for liver transplant work-up. The patient reported jaundice, abdominal distension, leg edema and exertional dyspnea (NYHA class II). Her initial MELD score was 15 which later progressed to 21. During her evaluation she developed acute hepatic decompensation and hepato-renal syndrome. Her 2D Echo demonstrated degenerative severe regurgitation and mild stenosis of AV (AV area =1.8 cm2) and moderately enlarged left ventricle with normal systolic function. She was declined for liver transplant due to her valvular heart disease. She was also deemed inoperable for surgical AVR by cardiothoracic surgery due to her frailty (frailty index 4/4) and liver cirrhosis with high MELD score. Decision-Making: The multidisciplinary care team agreed on pursuing trans-catheter AVR (TAVR) for treatment of the AV disease. The work-up included a diagnostic left heart catheterization (low-dose contrast technique) demonstrating normal coronaries, a pulmonary function test consistent with severe COPD. Under deep sedation, she successfully underwent placement of 29 mm self-expanding prosthesis (Evolut-R, Medtronic) with trans-femoral access. No AR was observed on post-TAVR Echo. She was subsequently listed for transplant. Six months later, she underwent combined orthotropic liver and kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor without any complications. Conclusions: The TAVR is a revolutionary and safer option for inoperable or moderate- or high-risk patients with native AV stenosis. Its use in AR has been described, although several limitations exist for this indication. Our case represents a unique life-saving role of TAVR beyond sole treatment of AV disease.

N2  - Frailty is a distinct phenotype that is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and appears to be more prevalent with decreasing glomerular filtration rate. Exercise training or intervention to increase physical activity may ameliorate poor physical functioning and frailty, and even may improve survival in patients with CKD. Although exercise interventions improve outcomes across the spectrum of CKD, including patients treated with dialysis, patients treated with dialysis face barriers to exercise that patients with predialysis CKD do not. Rehabilitation at earlier stages of CKD (or prehabilitation before dialysis) might be more beneficial than not addressing the decreasing physical functioning and low physical activity until patients are receiving dialysis. This review summarizes available literature on frailty in the CKD and end-stage renal disease population, including exercise interventions and the limited evidence for prehabilitation as a strategy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical implications of frailty in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and chronic peritoneal dialysis.
DESIGN: In this prospective study, all of the participants completed the Short Form of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, Korean version, to determine their frailty phenotype. We also obtained blood chemistry and demographic data at enrollment. Data regarding the history of hospitalization and death were collected during the follow-up period.
SUBJECTS: We recruited 1,658 patients (1,255 maintenance hemodialysis and 403 chronic peritoneal dialysis) from multidialysis units (n = 27). We excluded patients who had been hospitalized in the previous 3 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalization and survival rate during study period.
RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 55.2 ± 11.9 years old, and 55.2% were male. Among the participants, 34.8% were rated as frail and 45.7% as prefrail. Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant associations of frailty with age, comorbidity, disability, unemployment, higher body mass index, and a lower educational level. During the follow-up period (median 17.1 months), 608 patients (79 not frail, 250 prefrail, and 279 frail) were hospitalized, and 87 patients (10 not frail, 24 prefrail, and 53 frail) died (P < .001). Frailty was associated with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.38-2.36) and mortality (hazard ratio, 2.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-5.02).
CONCLUSION: The frailty phenotype was common even in, prevalent end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis, and was significantly associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality.

N2  - Background Providers are assuming growing responsibility for healthcare spending, and prior studies have shown that spending is concentrated in a small proportion of patients. Using simple methods to segment these patients into clinically meaningful subgroups may be a useful and accessible strategy for targeting interventions to control costs. Methods Using Medicare fee-for-service claims from 2011 (baseline year, used to determine comorbidities and subgroups) and 2012 (spending year), we used basic demographics and comorbidities to group beneficiaries into 6 cohorts, defined by expert opinion and consultation: under-65 disabled/ESRD, frail elderly, major complex chronic, minor complex chronic, simple chronic, and relatively healthy. We considered patients in the highest 10% of spending to be “high-cost.” Results 611,245 beneficiaries were high-cost; these patients were less often white (76.2% versus 80.9%) and more often dually-eligible (37.0% versus 18.3%). By segment, frail patients were the most likely (46.2%) to be high-cost followed by the under-65 (14.3%) and major complex chronic groups (11.1%); fewer than 5% of the beneficiaries in the other cohorts were high-cost in the spending year. The frail elderly ($70,196) and under-65 disabled/ESRD ($71,210) high-cost groups had the highest spending; spending in the frail high-cost group was driven by inpatient ($23,704) and post-acute care ($24,080), while the under 65-disabled/ESRD spent more through part D costs ($23,003). Conclusions Simple criteria can segment Medicare beneficiaries into clinically meaningful subgroups with different spending profiles. Implications Under delivery system reform, interventions that focus on frail or disabled patients may have particularly high value as providers seek to reduce spending. Level of evidence IV.

N2  - AIM: To present the rationale, design and methodology of the GERAS project, which examines whether assessment of frailty and mild cognitive impairment could enhance risk prediction for biomedical, psychosocial outcomes and foster efficient resource allocation in kidney transplantation.
BACKGROUND: For the burgeoning cohort of older patients considered for kidney transplantation, evidence gaps regarding frailty and mild cognitive impairment limit clinical decision-making and medical management. As known risk factors for 'hard' clinical outcomes in chronic illness, both require further study in transplantation. Integrating these and other bio-psychosocial factors into a comprehensive pre-transplant patient assessment will provide insights regarding economic implications and may improve risk prediction.
DESIGN: A nation-wide multi-centre prospective cohort study nested in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study.
METHODS: Our nationally representative convenience sample includes 250 adult kidney transplant recipients. Data sources include the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study and primary data collected at time of transplantation, 6 months, 1 and 2 years post-transplant via established measures (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Psychosocial Questionnaire, Fried Frailty Instrument and a blood analysis), investigator-developed instruments and datasets compiled by hospitals' management control units, sickness funds, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and the European Renal Association. Descriptive, competing risk survival and mixed effects analyses will be performed. Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained in January 2016.
DISCUSSION: This pioneering project jointly examines frailty and mild cognitive impairment from bio-psychosocial and health economic perspectives. Results may significantly inform risk prediction, care tailoring and resource optimization to improve health outcomes in the ageing kidney transplant cohort.

N2  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate hypertension (HTN) management in patients 80 years of age and older who reside in a large, long-term care (LTC) facility.
DATA SOURCE: A retrospective chart audit was conducted on 75 charts of patients 80 years of age and older and who had a diagnosis of HTN. Using the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) Expert Consensus Document on Management of Hypertension in the Elderly as a guide, blood pressure readings, significant comorbidities, and antihypertensive medication utilization were analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: LTC residents in this sample were often not treated according to expert recommendations. Specifically, analysis revealed overtreatment of uncomplicated HTN and undertreatment of those with comorbid conditions. Additionally, those with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease were infrequently prescribed ace inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, as recommended.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Utilizing evidence-based practice (EBP) guidelines affords the best avenue for providing safe and effective treatment of HTN. While expert recommendations are available, researchers seldom recruit frail elders in LTC facilities into treatment investigations. In the absence of population-specific EBP guidelines, nurse practitioners must rely on expert opinion and diagnostic reasoning to individualize HTN treatment to this unique and vulnerable population.

N2  - Aging with HIV poses unique and complex challenges, including avoidance of neurocognitive disorder. Our objective here is to identify the prevalence and predictors of successful cognitive aging (SCA) in a sample of older adults with HIV. One hundred three HIV-infected individuals aged 50 and older were recruited from the Modena HIV Metabolic Clinic in Italy. Participants were treated with combination antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year and had suppressed plasma HIV viral load. SCA was defined as the absence of neurocognitive impairment (as defined by deficits in tasks of episodic learning, information processing speed, executive function, and motor skills) depression, and functional impairment (instrumental activities of daily living). In cross-sectional analyses, odds of SCA were assessed in relation to HIV-related clinical data, HIV-Associated Non-AIDS (HANA) conditions, multimorbidity (≥2HANA conditions), and frailty. A frailty index was calculated as the number of deficits present out of 37 health variables. SCA was identified in 38.8% of participants. Despite no differences in average chronologic age between groups, SCA participants had significantly fewer HANA conditions, a lower frailty index, and were less likely to have hypertension. In addition, hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, p = .04), multimorbidity (OR = 0.35, p = .05), and frailty (OR = 0.64, p = .04) were significantly associated with odds of SCA. Frailty is associated with the likelihood of SCA in people living with HIV. This defines an opportunity to apply knowledge from geriatric population research to people aging with HIV to better appreciate the complexity of their health status.

N2  - Management of older people on dialysis requires focus on the wider aspects of aging as well as dialysis. Almost all frail and older patients receiving dialysis will default to in-center hemodialysis, although the availability of assisted peritoneal dialysis enables dialysis at home. As with any disease management decision, patients approaching end-stage renal disease need all the appropriate facts about their prognosis, the natural history of their disease without dialysis, and the resulting outcomes and complications of the different dialysis modalities. Hemodialysis in the older age group can be complicated by intradialytic hypotension, prolonged time to recovery, and vascular access–related problems. Peritoneal dialysis can be difficult for older patients with impaired physical or cognitive function and can become a considerable burden. Use of incremental dialysis, changes in hemodialysis frequency, and delivery and use of assistance for peritoneal dialysis can ameliorate quality of life for older patients. Understanding each individual's goals of care in the context of his or her life experience is particularly important in the elderly, when overall life expectancy is relatively short, and life experience or quality of life may be the priority. Indeed, some patients select the option of no dialysis or conservative care. With multifaceted assessments of care, physicians should be able to give individual patients the ability to select and continue to make the best decisions for their care.

N2  - Background Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals. Study Design Observational study. Setting & Participants 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013). Predictors Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio. Outcome Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical activity). Results 341 (7%) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30%) had eGFRcr < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 2,480 (50%) had eGFRcys < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 1,006 (20%) had albuminuria with albumin excretion ≥ 30 mg/g. Among frail participants, prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were 45% and 77%, respectively. Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals with eGFRcr of 60 to <75 mL/min/1.73 m2 were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR categories using eGFRcys (49% to 45-<60, 32% to 30-<45, and 3% to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking ≥10 classes of medications) was more common in frail individuals (54% vs 38% of nonfrail), including classes requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants). Limitations Cross-sectional study design. Conclusions Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this vulnerable population.

N2  - We first describe the implantation of a MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, USA) between 2 previously implanted MitraClips to treat recurrent mitral regurgitation (MR). An 82-year-old male patient presented with dyspnea New York Heart Association NYHA class III due to recurrent severe MR 18 months after primarily successful implantation of 2 MitraClips. The initial procedure was performed to treat severe MR due to prolapse and flail of the anterior leaflet and resulted in mild MR after implantation of 2 MitraClips. Concomitant diseases were persistent atrial fibrillation, moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation, and chronic kidney disease stage 3. Thus, the patient was not considered a suitable candidate for surgical treatment. Using fluoroscopic guidance, 2D- and 3D-transesophageal echocardiographies, we succeeded in placing a third clip between the previously implanted clips and reduced the severe MR to mild MR without increase in the mean gradient. No periprocedural complications were observed. Six months after the procedure the patient presented with mild MR and NYHA class I. <Learning objective: Implantation of MitraClips offers the possibility of percutaneous mitral valve repair. It is feasible, safe, and effective to implant a 3rd MitraClip between 2 previously implanted MitraClips to treat recurrent mitral regurgitation between the clips.>

N2  - Introduction Nocardiosis are uncommon. The diagnosis may be difficult, with significant morbidity and mortality, often occurring on frail patients. Few data are available in France. Methods A retrospective single center study was conducted from 2002 to 2014 and included all patients with at least one positive microbiological sample for Nocardia with a follow-up in our hospital. Results Nineteen patients, including 15 men, were included with a mean age of 58 years (25–85). Seventeen had a risk factor (lung diseases [13], corticosteroids [12], solid neoplasia [2], HIV infection [2], diabetes mellitus [3], kidney transplant [2], lymphopenia [1]). Infections’ locations were: pulmonary (12), brain (3), skin (2), lymph node (1) and corneal (1). The slow growth leads to a median of 35 days for a positive result (3–95). Nine species were identified. Fifteen patients (79%) received one or more lines of antibiotics including: cotrimoxazole (9), amoxicillin (7) cefotaxime/ceftriaxone (7) imipenem (3), or amikacin (3). The average duration of antibiotic therapy was 207 days. Four patients did not receive antibiotics due to a late result or a bacterial co-infection masking nocardiosis. Five patients died (26%) including 2 with cerebral nocardiosis. Six patients were cured, 4 suffered a relapse, 4 had an unknown evolution, and 1 was still treated. Conclusion Our study shows that nocardiosis is a disease difficult to treat. A better understanding of this type of infection is necessary.

N2  - The first treatment which slows the course of polycystic kidney disease is now available in Switzerland. There is no benefit of immunosuppression when treating IgA nephropathy. Rituximab has been proved effective in the treatment of membranous nephropathy. When to start renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury ? The debate still continues. In selected patients with end-stage renal failure, starting with twice a week hemodialysis is a desirable option. Peritoneal dialysis can be considered in frail patients. Better being transplanted with a HLA-incompatible living donor than to be on the waiting list. Immunosuppression without a calcineurin inhibitor is a potential immunologic hazard even for stable transplants. Long-Term results of belatacept-based immunosuppression instead of cyclosporin showed better graft and patient survival but more acute rejection.

N2  - Background. Frailty exhibits a high prevalence in end-stage renal disease (ESRD)patients and is associated with adverse health-related outcomes, including falls andfractures. Available studies do not address whether frailty is associated with temporalchanges in BMD. We evaluated this issue by analyzing the follow-up dual energy X-rayabsorptiometry (DXA) results in an ESRD cohort.Methods. In 2015, we enrolled forty-three ESRD patients, divided into frail, pre-frail,and robust ones based on a validated simple FRAIL scale, all receiving DXA at baseline.After one year of follow-up, survivors received another DXA, and we calculated theabsolute and percentage changes in area, bone mineral density (BMD), T-, and Z-scoresof lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN) between baseline and follow-up examinations.Results. Among all, frail individuals with ESRD had significantly lower average lumbarspine area, lower L4, FN, and totalBMDand T-scores, lower FN and total Z-scores thannon-frail ones, without differences in gender, body mass index, dialysis duration, andcomorbidities. Furthermore, we discovered frail ESRD patients had significantly moreprominent decrease in average lumbar spine area, percentage changes in L1 Z-scoresand average lumbar spine area, and a trend toward more prominent decrease in L4 areathan non-frail ones after one year of follow-up.Conclusions. Baseline frailty might be associated with deteriorating bone health,including shrinking L-spine areas and a more rapid decrease in L-spine Z scores, amongESRD patients. This frailty-bone association should be highlighted during our care offrail individuals with ESRD.

N2  - Frailty is a common complication in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under dialysis, which is a strong risk factor for low quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of frailty in a group of Portuguese ESRD patients, and its association with socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. We performed a cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3 [±14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire. Social support, data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory markers were also evaluated. Our results confirmed that frailty is a highly prevalent condition in ESRD patients, particularly in female patients. An association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.

N2  - The population of patients with moderate and severe CKD is growing. Frail and older patients comprise an increasing proportion. Many studies still exclude this group, so the evidence base is limited. In 2013 the advisory board of ERBP initiated, in collaboration with European Union of Geriatric Medicine Societies (EUGMS), the development of a guideline on the management of older patients with CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m2). The full guideline has recently been published and is freely available online and on the website of ERBP (www.european-renalbest- practice.org). This paper summarises main recommendations of the guideline and their underlying rationales.

N2  - Introduction: In patients over 64 years old the prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease is over 20% and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Conservative Renal Treatment is a valide treatment option. In recent years, fragility has become a field of research and should be taken into account in elderly Chronic Kidney patients. Aims: To determine the prevalence of frailty in Conservative Management patiens according to FRAIL Scale and to analyze the relationship between frailty, comorbidity and physical function. Material and Method: We recruited patients over 75 years old in Conservative Management in our ERCA consult. We analyzed Fraid Fragility Criteria, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Lawton and Brody Scale, assessment for FAC gait capability and Barthel Index. Results: 80 patients were included, 51.2% males, mean age 84.7 ± 4 years and eFG 16.5 ml/min/1.73m2. 51.2% met fragility criteria. We did not find significant differences in the Charlson Index between fragile (8.61 ± 1.28) and non-fragile patients (8.39 ± 1.36) p = 0.55. Lawton and Brody scale and FAC gait scale were associated with frailty (p = 0.001, p = 0.018 respectively). Conclusions: 51.2% of Conservative Management patients meet criteria of fragility, so we consider this scale valid as a tool in decision making. Fragility does not correlate with the Charlson index: the pathology assessed by this test may not be sensitive when studying this clinical situation. We found a good correlation with the tests that assess the functional situation, both in the scale of instrumental activities of Lawton Brody (useful to detect first degrees of deterioration) and for the FAC scale of gait.

N2  - Frailty increases early hospital readmission and mortality risk among kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. Although frailty represents a high-risk state for this population, the correlates of frailty, the patterns of the 5 frailty components, and the risk associated with these patterns are unclear. Methods. Six hundred sixty-three KT recipients were enrolled in a cohort study of frailty in transplantation (12/2008-8/2015). Frailty, activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) disability, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale depression, education, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) weremeasured.We used multinomial regression to identify frailty correlates. We identified which patterns of the 5 components were associated with mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Results. Frailty prevalence was 19.5%. Older recipients (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.07) were more likely to be frail. The only other factors that were independently associated with frailty were IADL disability (PR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.72-6.06), depressive symptoms (PR, 11.31; 95% CI, 4.02-31.82), less than a high school education (PR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.30-7.36), and low HRQOL (fair/poor: PR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.48-9.31). The most common pattern was poor grip strength, low physical activity, and slowed walk speed (19.4%). Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged as having an association with post-KT mortality. KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed walking speed (hazards ratio = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.17-5.03) and poor grip strength, exhaustion, and slowed walking speed (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.14-5.97) were at increased mortality risk. Conclusions. Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty among KT recipients; however, factors rarely measured as part of clinical practice, namely, HRQOL, IADL disability, and depressive symptoms, were significant correlates of frailty. Redefining the frailty phenotype may be needed to improve risk stratification for KT recipients.

N2  - The percentage of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) has declined in many countries since the mid-1990s. Barriers to PD have been reviewed extensively in the literature, but evidence about strategies to address these barriers and maximize the safe and effective use of PD is lacking. We therefore decided to conduct a scoping review identifying strategies to maximize PD use in adults with ESRD. Our search strategy included the following online databases: MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Current Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for articles published from 1974 to November 2013. Experts in the field were contacted for information about other ongoing or unpublished studies. A complementary search was conducted in the gray literature. Websites of national, provincial or regional agencies were searched for documents regarding policies surrounding the use of PD. Individual dialysis centers need to identify barriers to increasing PD in their program and direct targeted strategies to maximize PD utilization. Our review highlights some effective strategies that may be used. Our review also highlights the need for further research into strategies to maximize PD utilization.

N2  - Introduction. Labeling a patient as "frail" may be useful in assessing the prognosis and therapeutic approach. Objective. The aim of the study is to define a pattern of frailty among our dialysis population, to analyse the incidence and clinical evolution of these patients. Materials and Methods. We analysed a total of 320 patients with stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were on hemodialysis between September 2014 and September 2015. To define a patient as frail we used the Fried phenotype model, and we added a new criteria-dialysis session length longer than 12 hours/week. Results. 5.6% of the 320 patients were frail. We found statistically significant differences regarding body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin (Hgb), and serum albumin, as well as the ability to perform the basic activities of daily living (p<0.005), ability to ambulate (p=0.01) and perform transfers (p<0.005). We found statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of hospital admissions (p=0.005) and mortality (p<0.005). Conclusion. 5.6% of the study population were frail, with lower BMI, serum albumin and hemoglobin, lower capacity for basic activities of daily living, ambulation, and transference, as well as higher morbidity and mortality.

N2  - The prevalence of both type 2 diabetes and prediabetes increases with advancing age. The most important factors leading to hyperglycaemia are as follows: deficiency of insulin secretion developing with age, and growing insulin resistance caused by a change in body composition and sarcopaenia. Clinical features of diabetes in the elderly could be different. Diabetes in elderly people is often diagnosed with delay due to atypical symptoms (dementia, urinary incontinence) and occurrence of mainly postprandial hyperglycaemia. Elderly people are more exposed to diabetes complications, have more risk of myocardial infarction and end-stage renal disease, and are hospitalised more often due to hypoglycaemia than are younger patients. Elderly people with diabetes are a heterogeneous group with different life expectancy, concomitant of chronic diseases, and the ability to self-control blood glucose or give themselves an injection. The therapy should be individualised. Older people with long-term diabetes and numerous chronic complications need a more liberal approach to reach specific goals of therapy. Additional goals should be avoiding hypoglycaemia, safety of the therapy, and its acceptance by the patient.

N2  - Objective Frailty is associated with increased vulnerability to poor health. There is growing interest in understanding the association between frailty and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review explored how frailty is measured in patients with CKD and the association between frailty and adverse outcomes across different stages of renal impairment. Study design Systematic analysis of peer reviewed articles. Data sources Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane were used to identify the articles. Data synthesis Articles published before the 17th of September 2016, that measured frailty in patients with CKD was eligible for the systematic review. Two independent researchers assessed the eligibility of the articles. Quality of the articles was assessed using the Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument. Results The literature search yielded 540 articles, of which 32 met the study criteria and were included in the review (n = 36,076, age range: 50–83 years). Twenty-three (72%) studies used or adapted the Fried phenotype to measure frailty. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 7% in community-dwellers (CKD Stages 1–4) to 73% in a cohort of patients on haemodialysis. The incidence of frailty increased with reduced glomerular filtration rate. Frailty was associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization. Conclusion Frailty is prevalent in patients with CKD and it is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. There are differences in the methods used to assess frailty and this hinders comparisons between studies.

N2  - Background and Aims: We have recently identified physical frailty as a robust independent predictor of unplanned hospitalization and death in patients with cirrhosis. Cognitive impairment, otherwise termed “cognitive frailty” is another prognostic determinant commonly seen in cirrhosis not captured by physical frailty tools. We hypothesized that The Montreal Cognitive assessment (MoCA) would add to physical frailty in the prediction of hospitalization related outcomes (unplanned hospitalization or death within 6 months, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) related admissions within 1 year). We also aimed to identify which subdomains of the MoCA most commonly abnormal and were the most strongly associated with hospitalization. Methods: Consecutive adults with cirrhosis assessed in one of two Edmonton cirrhosis clinics between May 2013 and June 2016 were screened for enrolment. Exclusion criteria included active malignancy, HCC outside of Alberta liver transplant criteria and end-stage renal disease. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between the MoCA and the hospitalization based outcome measures. Results: Of345includedpatients with1year follow-updata, themean age was 56.9 ± 9.5, 66% were male and the etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol orhepatitisCin64%.ThemeanMOCAscorewas 24.1 ± 3.27and 56% had a score of <26, the cutoff for “abnormal”) Abnormalitieswere most commonly seen in the following MOCA subdomains - delayed recall (86%), visuospatial/executive (76%), attention (52%) and language( 55%) andleastcommonlyseen in abstraction (26%) andnaming (10%). After adjustment for multiple variables (including the clinical frailty scale), the MoCA score was an independent predictor of unplanned hospitalization or death at 6 months (Table 1) and an independent predictorofHErelated hospitalizations within1year(OR 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80 to 0.98), p = 0.02). The attention subdomainwas the most strongly associated with unplanned hospitalization and death (OR 2.2 (95% CI 1.3 to 3.8), p = 0.03). Conclusions: In a large cohort of stable cirrhosis outpatients, 56% of them have MoCA scores below the accepted lower limits of normal. The MoCA remained an independent predictor of both unplanned hospitalization and death AND HE related admissions even after adjustment for multiple clinical variables (including physical frailty). The attention subdomain of the MoCA may be the most useful variable to include in models developed for the prediction of hospitalization (Table presented).

N2  - Objective: To maximize the prophylactic benefits of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), patient selection is paramount. In particular, surgeons seek to identify patients likely to suffer perioperative complications as well as those with limited life expectancies. Accurate classification of these patients has been fraught with difficulty. Even when survival models take into account multiple comorbidities, they perform only moderately well (Patterson et al 2008).Frailty is defined broadly as a loss of physiologic reserve. This concept may help explain the gap between expected mortality based simply on comorbidities and observed mortality. Low muscle mass, or sarcopenia has garnered research interest because it can be conveniently estimated with measurement of the psoas muscle area on axial computed tomography (CT) images. Previous work has demonstrated an association between small psoas size and short-term complications, increased cost, and increased length of stay after major abdominal surgery and open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.This study is the first to examine sarcopenia's effect on the short- and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing EVAR. We hypothesize that patients with sarcopenia undergoing EVAR will not have a substantial increase in short-term morbidity and/or mortality. We base this on the less-invasive nature of the procedure compared with open AAA repair. However, we also hypothesize that the reduced long-term survival seen in patients with sarcopenia undergoing open AAA repair will also be observed in those undergoing EVAR. Indeed, sarcopenia may help vascular surgeons predict which patients are at risk of shortened survival, thus rendering prophylactic repair nonbeneficial. Methods: All patients who underwent elective EVAR at a single Veterans Affairs medical center from December 2010 to March 2016 were included in this study, except one patient who did not have an available preoperative CT. Patient characteristics and clinical data such as age, body mass index, comorbidities, preoperative aneurysm size, preoperative serum albumin, length of stay, postoperative complications, date of last follow-up, and date of death were collected retrospectively from the medical record. Delayed discharge was defined by a length of stay greater than 2 days. CT images were analyzed in Phillips iSite PACS v 3.6 (Philips Healthcare, Andover, Mass). Measurements of the left and right psoas muscles were obtained from CT imaging. These measures were taken on the axial CT slice immediately inferior to the fourth lumbar (L4) superior endplate using the standard PACS manual outline tool. Total psoas area (TPA) was calculated by adding the cross-sectional areas of the left and right psoas muscles.Patients were divided into tertiles based on TPA measurements for statistical analysis. Analysis was performed using SAS in-hospital mortality. Statistical analysis was performed with SAS v 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with a significance level of.05. The Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare group medians for continuous patient data, and the Fisher exact test was used to analyze categorical data. Multivariate analysis was performed using forward logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier survival was calculated, and survival compared using both the Wilcoxon signed rank test and log-rank test. Results: There were 135 patients, all men, with a median age of 70 years (interquartile range [IQR], 65-76 years) and median aneurysm size of 5.5 cm (IQR, 5.2-6.0 cm) at the time of EVAR. Common patient comorbidities included hypertension (78%, n = 106), coronary artery disease (44%, n = 60), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (32%, n = 46), and current or former smoker status (84%, n = 130). Median body mass index for the cohort was 27 kg/m2 (IQR, 24-31 kg/m2).Short-term adverse outcomes included 33 delayed discharges (25% of patients) and one in-hospital death from stroke. The most common reasons found for delayed discharge included respiratory insufficiency (8.9%, n = 12) and urinary retention (4.0%, n = 9). On univariate analysis, delayed discharge was associated with increased age (P <.002), longer operative time (P <.002), current or previous smoker (P <.03), and chronic kidney disease (P <.002). Patients with TPA in the lowest tertile, less than 2406 mm2, had a 30% (n = 13) incidence of delayed discharge. This was not significantly higher than the 23% (n = 33) observed for patients in the middle and highest tertiles (P >.40). On multivariate analysis, only coronary artery disease (odds ration [OR], 2.5 95% confidence interval [CI], 1-6.4), chronic kidney disease (OR, 7.5, 95% CI, 2.3 - 24.6), and age (OR, 1.1, 95% CI, 1.0-1.2) were found to be significant predictors of delayed discharge, while TPA was not identified as predictive.Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the lowest tertile TPA and the higher two tertiles were calculated (Fig 1). Examination of the survival curves shows divergence after approximately 3 years following EVAR. Patients with lowest-tertile TPA had 42% 5-year survival compared with 93% survival observed for the remaining two-thirds of patients. This difference did not reach statistically significance according to the Wilcoxon signed rank test (P =.19), while it did reach significance according to the log-rank test (P <.02), suggesting again that the difference is seen in late, not early mortality. Multivariate analysis revealed increased likelihood of mortality at 5 years for patients in the lowest tertile for TPA (OR, 3.9, 95% CI, 1.2-12.9), as well as for patients with chronic kidney disease (OR, 5.2, 95% CI, 1.5-18.0). Age was not identified as a predictor of mortality in this study population when TPA was included in the multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Sarcopenia is marker of frailty that is conveniently quantified by measuring total psoas area at L4. In this study of patients undergoing EVAR, low total psoas area was not predictive of increased length of stay or short-term mortality. We believe this is due to the procedure's small physiologic insult, from which reasonably selected frail patients can recover in the short term. However, low total psoas area was found to be an independent predictor of long-term mortality, with patients in the lowest tertile of TPA demonstrating markedly reduced survival. With further study, including TPA in postoperative survival models may help guide preoperative risk stratification and identify patients unlikely to benefit from prophylactic repair.

N2  - In the last year the new Clinical Practice Guideline on management of older patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3b or higher (eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2) was published (futher referred to as Guidelines). The Guidelines were created under the umbrella of the European Renal Association – European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) that was represented by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) group. Complete text was published in Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation and it is freely accessible on the Internet, e.g. in Medline database. In the following text we provide a brief summary of the Guidelines intended for a broad spectrum of experts´ community. Its target is providing both source of new information and guideline for solving unclear diagnostic or therapeutic cases in patients of this age with kidney disease. Apart from usual rigorous approach to methodology and data evaluation, the text provides amounts of practical information concerning everyday practice and it is oriented on conclusions important from patients´ prognosis point of view. The Guidelines are divided into eight principal topics that deal with management of older patients with CKD stage 3b or higher: i/ what parameter should be used in older patients to estimate kidney function and for dose adaptation purposes; ii/ what is the most reliable risk model score to predict progression of chronic kidney disease; iii/ what is the most reliable risk prediction model to predict mortality; iv/ what is the best alternative method to asses functional decline; v/ are interventions aimed at increasing functional status of benefit; vi/ which is the best alternative to evaluate nutritional status; vii/ which interventions are effective in improving nutritional status; viii/ what is the benefit of dialysis. Development and publication of the Guidelines undoubtedly contribute to improvement of management of older and frail patients with advanced CKD stages.

N2  - Background: Patients receiving chronic dialysis often require emergency care, however little is known about their pre-hospital/ inter-hospital use of Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The purpose of this study was to describe the utilization of EMS in a cohort of dialysis patients, and evaluate patient factors associated with increased rates of EMS use. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult (318 years), chronic dialysis patients within our renal program from 1 Jan 2009 to 31 Dec 2013 (last follow-up 1 July 2015). Dialysis patient data was linked to regional EMS data. Requests for EMS, including encounter type and day of the week were described. Time to EMS use (for those who required treatment and facility transport) or death was analyzed using a multivariable Anderson-Gill Cox Regression model (for multiple recurring events) adjusted for demographics, comorbid illnesses and frailty severity. Frailty severity was evaluated using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) that categorizes patients from 1 (very fit) to 7 (severely frail). Results: Among 468 patients there were 10823 EMS encounters. Interfacility transfers accounted for 91% of all encounters (N=9833) followed by treated and transported encounters (7%, N=782). Most EMS transports occurred on Monday (17%) and Tuesday (18%), which is typically the longest break after the patient's last dialysis treatment. There were a total of 191 deaths during the study (total time at risk of 1237 years). The highest severity of frailty using the CFS was associated with a 4 fold higher relative hazard for EMS use (HR 3.92, 95% CI [2.39-6.42]). Frailty severity scores of 4-6 were also associated with a higher relative hazard for EMS use. The use of dialysis catheters vs. arteriovenous fistulas (HR: 1.21) and prior history of congestive heart failure (HR: 1.24) were also associated with a higher relative hazard for EMS use. Discussion: Dialysis patients utilize a considerable amount of EMS resources, particularly for transfers. Alternative modes of transport or the possibility of home dialysis should be explored for these individuals. Additionally, increased rates of treatment and transport occurred on Mondays and Tuesdays. This could be due to the long dialysis break, indicating a potential need to transport these patients directly to a dialysis capable centre. The need for urgent/emergent dialysis within this population after emergency room presentation is an item that requires further study. Increasing degrees of frailty was associated with a greater likelihood of EMS usage. Furthermore, supports must be put in place to decrease EMS use in this vulnerable population, such as the prehospital care provider determining which patients are suitable to be transported directly to dialysis, and which can receive treatment and remain at home. Conclusion: Dialysis patients frequently utilize EMS services, primarily for inter-facility transfers. Increased rates of transport following the long dialysis break call for potential reevaluation of system status plans. Clinical factors including a higher frailty severity is associated with more frequent EMS usage.

N2  - Background: The long-term management of patients with coexistent severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and liver cirrhosis constitutes a real challenge because severe AR is a contraindication for solid organ transplantation, and liver cirrhosis conveys a high risk of mortality for surgical aortic valve (AV) replacement (AVR). Therefore, these patients are often declined for life-saving surgical treatment options. Case Report: A 56-year-old female with a history of AR and liver cirrhosis secondary to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis presented to our center for liver transplant workup. The patient reported jaundice, abdominal distension, leg edema, and exertional dyspnea (NYHA class II). Her initial Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 15, which later progressed to 21. During her evaluation, she developed acute hepatic decompensation and hepatorenal syndrome. Her 2-dimensional echocardiogram demonstrated degenerative severe regurgitation, mild stenosis of AV (AV area=1.8 cm2), and moderately enlarged left ventricle with normal systolic function. She was declined for liver transplant due to her valvular heart disease. She was also deemed inoperable for surgical AVR due to her frailty (frailty index 4/4) and liver cirrhosis with high MELD score. The multidisciplinary care team agreed on pursuing transcatheter AVR (TAVR) for treatment of the AV disease. The workup included a diagnostic left heart catheterization demonstrating normal coronaries. Under deep sedation, the patient successfully underwent placement of a 29-mm self-expanding prosthesis with transfemoral access. No AR was observed on post-TAVR echocardiogram. She was subsequently listed for transplant. Six months later, she underwent combined orthotropic liver and kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor without any complications. Conclusion: The TAVR is a revolutionary and safer option for inoperable or moderate to high-risk patients with native AV stenosis. Its use in AR has been described, although several limitations exist for this indication. Our case demonstrates a unique lifesaving role of TAVR beyond sole treatment of AV disease.

N2  - Secondary prevention for ischaemic heart disease can be defined as a comprehensive set of measures, aiming to reduce the recurrence of cardiovascular disease and to improve long-term prognosis. Despite its proven efficacy, uptake and adherence rates remain poor. This paper summarises the available European recommendations for secondary prevention in varying ischaemic heart disease populations, including those patients with specific co-morbidities. The scientific evidence supporting these recommendations is provided. The article relates to the European Association of Preventive Cardiology, the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association and the Council on Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions Secondary Prevention After Acute Myocardial Infarction framework in that it clarifies accurately who needs secondary prevention.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of physical activity on various aspects in Asian dialysis patients. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. Study participants were recruited from 27 hospitals or dialysis centers in Korea (n = 1611). The participants were divided into 3 groups according to the degree of regular exercise: Inactive group, Intermediate group, and Active group. Results: The proportions of patients with frailty and the presence of each component decreased as physical activity increased. The presence and numbers of disabilities decreased as physical activity increased. The number of participants with a history of fall during the last 12 months was 149 (20.5%) in the Inactive group, 88 (16.9%) in the Intermediate group, and 48 (13.2%) in the Active group. Physical component scale and mental component scale scores increased as physical activity increased. The survival rate for all-cause death at 500 days was 95.5% in the Active group, 95.2% in the Intermediate group, and 93.5% in the Inactive group. Conclusion: High physical activity was associated with favorable results for most health-related quality of life scale scores, including frailty, disability, and exhaustion, in Korean dialysis patients.

N2  - Objective To determine the safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use compared with warfarin use for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Design Retrospective matched cohort study conducted between 1 January 2009 and 31 March 2016. Setting Community based, using healthcare data from six jurisdictions in Canada and the United States. Participants 59 525 adults (12 489 DOAC users; 47 036 warfarin users) with a new diagnosis of venous thromboembolism and a prescription for a DOAC or warfarin within 30 days of diagnosis. Main outcome measures Outcomes included hospital admission or emergency department visit for major bleeding and all cause mortality within 90 days after starting treatment. Propensity score matching and shared frailty models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of the outcomes comparing DOACs with warfarin. Analyses were conducted independently at each site, with meta-analytical methods used to estimate pooled hazard ratios across sites. Results Of the 59 525 participants, 1967 (3.3%) had a major bleed and 1029 (1.7%) died over a mean follow-up of 85.2 days. The risk of major bleeding was similar for DOAC compared with warfarin use (pooled hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.03), with the overall direction of the association favouring DOAC use. No difference was found in the risk of death (pooled hazard ratio 0.99, 0.84 to 1.16) for DOACs compared with warfarin use. There was no evidence of heterogeneity across centres, between patients with and without chronic kidney disease, across age groups, or between male and female patients. Conclusions In this analysis of adults with incident venous thromboembolism, treatment with DOACs, compared with warfarin, was not associated with an increased risk of major bleeding or all cause mortality in the first 90 days of treatment. Trial registration Clinical trials NCT02833987.

N2  - The literature reveals that current nephrology practice in obtaining informed consent for dialysis falls short of ethical and legal requirements. Meeting these requirements represents a significant challenge, especially because the benefits and risks of dialysis have shifted significantly with the growing number of older, comorbid patients. The importance of informed consent for dialysis is heightened by several concerns, including: (1) the proportion of predialysis patients and patients on dialysis who lack capacity in decision making and (2) whether older, comorbid, and frail patients understand their poor prognosis and the full implications to their independence and functional status of being on dialysis. This article outlines the ethical and legal requirements for a valid informed consent to dialysis: (1) the patient was competent, (2) the consent was made voluntarily, and (3) the patient was given sufficient information in an understandable manner to make the decision. It then considers the application of these requirements to practice across different countries. In the process of informed consent, the law requires a discussion by the physician of the material risks associated with dialysis and alternative options. We argue that, legally and ethically, this discussion should include both the anticipated trajectory of the illness and the effect on the life of the patient with particular regard to the outcomes most important to the individual. In addition, a discussion should occur about the option of a conservative, nondialysis pathway. These requirements ensure that the ethical principle of respect for patient autonomy is honored in the context of dialysis. Nephrologists need to be open to, comfortable with, and skillful in communicating this information. From these clear, open, ethically, and legally valid consent discussions, a significant dividend will hopefully flow for patients, families, and nephrologists alike.

N2  - Background and objectives Although arteriovenous fistulas have been found to be the most cost-effective form of hemodialysis access, the relative benefits of placing an arteriovenous fistula versus an arteriovenous graft seem to be least certain for older adults and when placed preemptively. However, older adults’ life expectancy is heterogeneous, and most patients do not undergo permanent access creation until after dialysis initiation. We evaluated cost-effectiveness of arteriovenous fistula placement after dialysis initiation in older adults as a function of age and life expectancy. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Using a hypothetical cohort of patients on incident hemodialysis with central venous catheters, we constructed Markov models of three treatment options: (1) arteriovenous fistula placement, (2) arteriovenous graft placement, or (3) continued catheter use. Costs, utilities, and transitional probabilities were derived from existing literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed by age group (65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, and 85-89 years old) and quartile of life expectancy. Costs, quality-adjusted life- months, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were evaluated for up to 5 years. Results The arteriovenous fistula option was cost effective compared with continued catheter use for all age and life expectancy groups, except for 85-89 year olds in the lowest life expectancy quartile. The arteriovenous fistula option was more cost effective than the arteriovenous graft option for all quartiles of life expectancy among the 65- to 69-year-old age group. For older age groups, differences in cost-effectiveness between the strategies were attenuated, and the arteriovenous fistula option tended to only be cost effective in patients with life expectancy >2 years. For groups for which the arteriovenous fistula option was not cost saving, the cost to gain one quality- adjusted life-month ranged from $2294 to $14,042. Conclusions Among older adults, the cost-effectiveness of an arteriovenous fistula placed within the first month of dialysis diminishes with increasing age and lower life expectancy and is not the most cost-effective option for those with the most limited life expectancy.

N2  - Palliative care clinicians are increasingly involved in the care of elderly patients suffering from chronic malignant and nonmalignant illnesses, of which neuropathic pain is a prevalent problem. As a person becomes more frail, pain medications such as opioid analgesics and adjuvant pain medications can result in unwanted effects such as sedation, confusion, and increased risk of falls. Treating pain in patients with advanced dementia or neurodegenerative diseases that can affect swallowing is particularly challenging because most adjuvant pain medications used to ameliorate neuropathic pain must be taken orally. Furthermore, dosing of neuropathic medications is limited by renal function, which is often impaired in the elderly due to both normal aging and renal disease. Methadone is an opioid analgesic that is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain, is excreted by the bowels, is highly lipophilic, and can be administered through the oral, buccal, or sublingual routes. We present three cases highlighting the use of low-dose adjuvant methadone to manage complex neuropathic pain in the frail elderly.

N2  - Introduction and case report description A 68-year old female was referred for the treatment of severe functional mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient had been wheel-chair dependent with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2 and end-stage renal dysfunction and she lately reported a progressive dyspnea (NYHA class 3). Pre-procedural transthoracic echocardiography revealed moderately reduced left ventricular global function with a significant central MR due to posterior mitral valve leaflet tethering (Figure 1 in PDF). There was also severe tricuspid regurgitation with severely elevated systolic pulmonary pressure. Considering a high risk for surgery (STS 8.5) and frailty, the multi-disciplinary heart team reached a consensus of a MitraClip procedure. • Description of the problem, procedures, techniques and/or equipment used The MitraClip procedure was performed under general anesthesia in accordance with international standard. The first MitraClip was attempted at the central A2-P2 location. The clipping had been attempted several times due to suboptimal reduction of MR (Figure 2A in PDF). The MitraClip system presented then malfunction and the clip was not released and a new clip system was delivered. Meanwhile intra-procedural transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) revealed potential chordal rupture (Figure 2B in PDF). After another attempt, the first clip was finally implanted at the A2-P2 level with a severe residual MR lateral and medial to the clip and ruptured chordae at P3 (Figure 3 in PDF). The transvalvular mean pressure gradient was 2 mmHg. The 2nd MitraClip was implanted laterally to 1st clip. There was still significant residual MR with possibly newly emerged eccentric jet originating from the medial commissure (Figure 4 in PDF). The transvalvular mean pressure gradient increased to 5 mmHg. The 3rd MitraClip was attempted near the medial commissure. The residual MR was still at least moderate (Figure 5 in PDF), yet the transvalvular mean pressure gradient increased to 10 mmHg. Therefore, the 3rd clip was not released. After withdrawing the 3rd clip, TOE showed a sign for perforation to the medial side of 1st clip with several chordal ruptures (Figure 6 in PDF). • Questions, problems or possible differential diagnosis Question 1 What would be option for the patient then? Question 2 How extensive was the mitral valve (MV) damage? • Answers and discussion The patient's condition was discussed again within the heart team and she was sent for surgery. Intraoperatively, a perforation at P2 and partial detachment of the MitraClip (1st clip) from the posterior leaflet (Figure 7A in PDF) were seen. The P3 scallop was completely damaged with several chordal rupture (Figure 7B in PDF). The 2nd clip on A1-P1 was in situ. Eventually, the MV was replacement with a 29 mm mechanical prosthesis. A tricuspid plasty also took place. The MV replacement was inevitable in the end considering the extensive MV damage. The MV damage was most probably caused by multiple attempts of leaflet grasping and clipping of two MitraClips. The procedure was closely monitored with TOE and MV damages were revealed instantaneously, which was further confirmed with surgical findings. • Conclusions and implications for clinical practice Leaflet grasping and clipping attempts during MitraClip procedure may cause severe damage to the MV apparatus. Intra-procedural TOE is crucial in monitoring the procedure and spotting potential damages. Instant TOE findings should be taken into decision making of either continuing the MitraClip procedure for damage control or a surgical bailout.

N2  - Background/Aims: Previous studies showed that frailty is prevalent in both pre-dialysis and dialysis patients. However, the prevalence and prognostic implication of frailty in Chinese peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients remain unknown. Methods: We used a validated questionnaire to determine the Frailty Score of 193 unselected prevalent PD patients. All patients were then followed for 2 years for their need of hospitalization and mortality. Results: Amongst the 193 patients, 134 (69.4%) met the criteria of being frail. Frailty Score significantly correlated with Charlson's comorbidity score (r = 0.40, p < 0.0001), Malnutrition Inflammation Score (r = 0.59, p < 0.0001), and inversely with Subjective Global Assessment score (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001). Frailty was closely associated with the need of hospitalization. Patients with nil, mild, moderate, and severe frailty required 2.4 ± 6.0, 1.6 ± 1.6, 2.7 ± 2.5, 5.2 ± 4.8 hospital admissions per year, respectively (p < 0.0001), and they stayed in hospital for 6.4 ± 9.2, 5.3 ± 6.2, 10.0 ± 10.4, 12.9 ± 20.1 days per hospital admission, respectively (p < 0.0001). However, Frailty Score was not an independent predictor of patient or technique survival. Conclusions: Frailty is prevalent among Chinese PD patients. Frail PD patients have a high risk of requiring hospitalization and their hospital stay tends to be prolonged. Early identification may allow timely intervention to prevent adverse health outcomes in this group of patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Group-based trajectory models have been applied to classify patients based on medication adherence patterns over time, rather than a single summary measure (e.g., proportion of days covered). Previous studies of trajectory group membership used claims data to predict trajectory group inclusion. RESEARCH QUESTION OR HYPOTHESIS: The study objective was to classify 12-month statin medication adherence patterns and develop prediction formulas for forecasting individual patients' adherence trajectories using baseline claims and EMRbased clinical data. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive analysis METHODS: Members of a Midwestern health plan who initiated new statin therapy in 2012 were included. Members were partitioned into six group-based trajectory models of utilization using latent class analysis. Logistic regressions were conducted with membership in each adherence group as the outcome. Demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization variables were explored as possible predictors of inclusion into adherence groups. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to determine the best multivariate predictive model for each group. RESULTS: Six adherence trajectory groups were defined with distinct adherence and persistence patterns over 12 months; including ongoing persistence, early discontinuation, and fluctuation in utilization. The trajectory most easily predicted was discontinuation at approximately two months (C-statistic = 0.74). Predictors for this group included: black or Hispanic race/ethnicity; Charlson score; diagnosis of a chronic lung condition, chronic kidney disease, obesity, or depression; the use of multiple prescribers or multiple pharmacies; and total number of chronic prescription medications. CONCLUSION: Baseline clinical and claims-based characteristics may be used to identify new statin users likely to follow one of six specific adherence trajectories. This information may support early targeted interventions to improve adherence in high-risk groups.

N2  - Metformin (MF) accumulation during acute kidney injury is associated with high anion gap lactic acidosis type B (MF-associated lactic acidosis, MALA), a serious medical condition leading to high mortality. Despite dose adjustment for renal failure, diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III–IV are at risk for rapid decline in renal function by whatever reason, so that MF toxicity might arise if the drug is not timely withdrawn. Sixteen consecutive patients were admitted to our Hospital’s Emergency Department with clinical findings consistent with MALA. Fifteen had prior history of CKD, 60 % of them with GFR between 30 and 60 ml/min. Of these, 5 required mechanical ventilation and cardiovascular support; 3 promptly recovered renal function after rehydration, whereas 10 (62 %) required continuous veno-venous renal replacement treatment. SOFA and SAPS II scores were significantly related to the degree of lactic acidosis. In addition, lactate levels were relevant to therapeutic choices, since they were higher in dialyzed patients than in those on conservative treatment (11.92 mmol/l vs 5.7 mmol/l, p = 0.03). The overall death rate has been 31 %, with poorer prognosis for worse acidemia, as serum pH was significantly lower in non-survivors (pH 6.96 vs 7.16, p > 0.04). Our own data and a review of the literature suggest that aged, hemodynamically frail patients, with several comorbidities and CKD, are at greater risk of MALA, despite MF dosage adjustment. Moreover, renal replacement therapy rather than simple acidosis correction by administration of alkali seems the treatment of choice, based on eventual renal recovery and overall outcome.

N2  - Metabolic acidosis is common in advanced chronic kidney disease and has been associated with a range of physiological derangements of importance to the health of older people. These include associations with skeletal muscle weakness, cardiovascular risk factors, and bone and mineral disorders that may lead to fragility fractures. Although metabolic acidosis is associated with accelerated decline in kidney function, end-stage renal failure is a much less common outcome in older, frail patients than cardiovascular death. Correction of metabolic acidosis using bicarbonate therapy is commonly employed, but the existing evidence is insufficient to know whether such therapy is of net benefit to older people. Bicarbonate is bulky and awkward to take, may impose additional sodium load with effects on fluid retention and blood pressure, and may cause gastrointestinal side effects. Trial data to date suggest potential benefits of bicarbonate therapy on progression of renal disease and nutrition, but trials have not as yet been published examining the effect of bicarbonate therapy across a range of domains relevant to the health of older people. Fortunately, a number of trials are now underway that should allow us to ascertain whether bicarbonate therapy can improve physical function, quality of life, and vascular, bone and kidney health in older people, and hence decide whether any benefits seen outweigh adverse effects and additional treatment burden in this vulnerable group of patients.

N2  - As people age, chronic kidney disease becomes more common, but it rarely leads to end-stage kidney disease. When it does, the choice between dialysis and conservative care can be daunting, as much depends on life expectancy and personal expectations of medical care. Shared decision making implies adequately informing patients about their options, and facilitating deliberation of the available information, such that decisions are tailored to the individual's values and preferences. Accurate estimations of one's risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease and death with or without dialysis are essential for shared decision making to be effective. Formal risk prediction models can help, provided they are externally validated, well-calibrated and discriminative; include unambiguous and measureable variables; and come with readily applicable equations or scores. Reliable, externally validated risk prediction models for progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage kidney disease or mortality in frail elderly with or without chronic kidney disease are scant. Within this paper, we discuss a number of promising models, highlighting both the strengths and limitations physicians should understand for using them judiciously, and emphasize the need for external validation over new development for further advancing the field.

N2  - Background The modified frailty index (mFI) has been shown to predict adverse outcomes in multiple nonorthopedic surgical specialties. This study aimed to assess whether mFI is a predictor of adverse events in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods Patients who underwent THA and TKA from 2005-2012 were identified in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. mFI was calculated for each patient using 15 variables found in National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Bivariate and multivariate analyses of postoperative adverse events, including Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications, were performed. Results A total of 14,583 THA and 25,223 TKA patients were included for analysis. The mean (standard deviation, range) mFIs were 0.083 (0.080, 0-0.55) for THA and 0.097 (0.080, 0-0.64) for TKA cohorts. On bivariate analyses, incidence of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, septic shock, pulmonary embolism, postoperative dialysis, reintubation, and prolonged ventilator requirement), hospital-acquired conditions (surgical site infection, venous thromboembolism, and urinary tract infection), any complications, and mortality increased significantly with increase in mFI (P <.0001 for all). Adjusting for demographics, age ≥ 75, body mass index ≥40, American Society of Anesthesiologists class ≥4, and nonclean wound status, mFI ≥0.45 was shown to be the strongest independent predictor of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications for both THA and TKA cohorts with odds ratios of 5.140 and 4.183, respectively. Conclusion mFI ≥0.45 is an independent predictor of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications in TKA/THA patients with greater odds ratios than age >75, body mass index ≥40, American Society of Anesthesiologists class ≥4. mFI should be considered for risk stratifying joint arthroplasty patients preoperatively and perhaps determining immediate postoperative destination.

N2  - Aims: The ValuedCare (VC) hip fracture programme is a quality improvement (QI) programme launched by Changi General Hospital (CGH), a major public hospital in Singapore, in collaboration with Geisinger Health System (GHS) USA to provide comprehensive care for patients with hip fracture. This programme incorporates multiple best practice elements (BPEs) comprising process indicators, evidence based management protocols and key outcome measures over one year. Various studies worldwide have demonstrated gaps in secondary prevention after hip fracture. This study aims to identify existing gaps in osteoporosis management and develop osteoporosis-related BPEs in the VC programme. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 126 consecutive patients aged ≥65 y admitted from 1 July to 30 November 2014 with a fragility hip fracture and underwent surgical fixation. We obtained records of BMD scanning, calcium/vitamin D (Vit D) supplementation and antiresorptive drug treatment within 3 months postoperatively. Gaps identified were analysed via a series of QI sessions with GHS and our multidisciplinary team, leading to the development of related BPEs and protocols. Results: 57.1 % of the patients had BMD testing done. Patients >80 y old were less likely to have BMD testing (42.4 % vs. 73.3 %; p < 0.001). Combined calcium/Vit D supplementation was prescribed in 95 % of the patients. Specific Vit D supplementation such as cholecalciferol (1000 IU) or ergocalciferol (50000 IU) was prescribed in 63 % of the patients depending on their serum 25-hydroxyVit D level. Antiresorptives such as alendronate or risedronate were prescribed in 21.4 % of the patients. None were prescribed parenteral antiresorptives. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were less likely to receive antiresorptive treatment (10.3 % vs. 26.4 %; OR 3.41; p = 0.041) Conclusion:Secondary prevention of falls and fractures is critical in hip fracture patients. Whilst supplementation was widely practised, clear gaps in BMD testing and antiresorptive treatment initiation were identified. Osteoporosis-related BPEs have since been implemented in the VC programme, including BMD and serum Vit D testing, supplementation, community rehabilitation as well as bisphosphonate initiation within 4 weeks postoperatively. Case managers and telecarers will educate patients, monitor compliance to osteoporosis management and track falls and fractures over one year. Complex cases are referred to the bone clinic for consideration of parenteral therapy. Challenges remain in enforcing long-term compliance and initiation of anti-resorptive treatment, particularly in patients with CKD and the oldest, frail elderly population.

N2  - BACKGROUND Although hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), low LDL are associated with worse outcomes in acute coronary syndromes (ACS), potentially because of confounding from elderly, frail or other comorbidities. We investigated the presence of a cholesterol paradox in stable CAD patients. METHODS We analyzed data from 6595 consecutive stable CAD patients receiving PCI at a tertiary care center in New York. To reduce potential confounding, patients with these characteristics were excluded: age>80y, baseline hemoglobin<9g/dl, eGFR<30ml/min, BMI<25. Based on admission LDL, we stratified patients into: LDL<70mg/dl, n=2542(39%); 70-LDL-100mg/dl, n= 2313(35%); LDL>100mg/dl, n=1740(26%). RESULTS Compared to higher LDL, patients with LDL<70 mg/dl were older (64.6vs63.9vs62.3 years old, p<0.001), more frequently males (77%vs69%vs65%, p<0.001) with diabetes mellitus (54%vs46%vs41%, p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (26.9%vs22.8%vs21.6%, p<0.001) and anemia (36.3%vs28.9%vs23.2%, p<0.001). They more often had a history of myocardial infarction, CABG and were on aspirin, statins, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors at admission. Periprocedural complications and 30-day readmission rate were similar across the groups (1.9%vs1.6vs1.8, p=ns). Adjusted 1-year risk of outcomes are shown in FIGURE using LDL<70 mg/dl as reference. (Figure Presented) CONCLUSION Stable CAD patients with low LDL have a higher-risk clinical phenotype than those with higher LDL. Nevertheless, adjusted MACE risk was not increased in low LDL patients, suggesting the cholesterol paradox is due to residual confounding from comorbid risk factors. This population may benefit from further risk modification.

N2  - Objectives: Considering the lack of information about frailty in endstage renal disease (ESRD) patients under dialysis, the aims of this work was to evaluate the prevalence of frailty in these patients, and its association with socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3 [±14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire. Moreover, it was also evaluated the social support, as well as data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory markers. Results: Our group of ESRD patients showed a prevalence of pre-frailty and frailty of 54.2% and 28.9%, respectively. When compared the 3 groups of patients, we found a significant increase in proportion of female, diabetes and hypertension in frail group. A significant increase in ferritin level, global deterioration scale score, Beck depression inventory (BDI) scale score and Charlson comorbidity index score; and decrease in haemoglobin concentration, iron, transferrin and albumin serum levels, and in mini mental state examination (MMSE) scale score, were also found in frail patients. Using adjusted models, we found that gender, MMSE score, BDI score, and iron, ferritin, and albumin serum levels as independent variables associated with frailty. Conclusion: Frailty is a high prevalent condition in ESRD patients under dialysis, particularly in female patients, which is associated with a decrease nutritional status and cognitive function and with increased depressive symptoms.

N2  - Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and frail has received increased attention as a leading public health problem. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney function and frailty among community-dwelling older adults. Methods: We analyzed the cohort data from a prospective study entitled National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology - Study of Geriatric Syndromes. Participants comprised 9,334 community-dwelling older adults who were participating in the Estimated glomerular filtration rate was determined according to creatinine levels, and participants were classified into two categories: ≥60.0, 59-45, <45 mL/min/1.73 m2. Frailty defined by the CHS index as proposed by Fried et al was identified by the presence of 3 or more of the following 5 components: weight loss, poor grip strength, reduced energy level, slow walking speed, and low level of physical activity. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between kidney function and frailty. Results: The results suggested that lowest kidney function were at a greater than higher risk of being frail in comparison to highest kidney function (OR:1.37, CI: 1.01-1.85). Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of being frail with lower physical activity (OR:3.98, CI:1.67-9.47). Conclusion: A lower level of kidney function was associated with higher risk of being frail in community-dwelling older adults.

N2  - Introduction: Coronary Care Units (CCU) have become a cornerstone in the early treatment of patients (pts) after a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure. Our aim was to show the main baseline features, initial management and early outcomes of our TAVI pts admitted after the procedure in an advanced CCU led by Cardiologists. Methods: We included all pts transferred from the Catheterization Laboratory (CL) to the CCU, just after a TAVI procedure between 2009 and 2016. All baseline and in-hospital characteristics were prospectively collected in a database. Adverse events were defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2, including myocardial infarction (x 15 times of normal peak of high-sensitivity (hs) T-Troponin). Results: A total of 197 TAVI pts were included with a mean age of 80.7±6.3 years and 42.6% of women. Mean STS score was 6.4±5.1% and LogEuroScore was 15.5±10.9% with 61.9% of diabetes mellitus, 54.3% of previous heart failure, and 48.7% of known coronary artery disease. Coronary revascularization had been performed in 38.2% by either percutaneous (31.1%) or surgical (7.1%) interventions. The rate of other comorbities such as chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease and previous stroke was respectively 19.8%, 25.9%, 12.7% and 12.2%. Frailty (present in 30.6% of our cohort) was assessed by eye-ball test and Charlson and Barthel scales. Mean stay in CCU was 3.8±4.7 days. According to adverse outcomes, 11.6% developed acute kidney injury (AKI) (18% requiring dialysis) and 6.3% an episode of sepsis. Early acute stroke rate was 1.5%. Permanent pacemaker (PM) was implanted in 3.1% of pts during the stay in the CCU (over a rate of 19.8% of PM implantation). New onset atrial fibrillation was documented in 10.8%. New left bundle branch block was evidenced in 10.2%. Minor and major vascular complications occurred in 14.3% and 18%, including 6 pts with retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Elevated cardiac enzymes (x15 times baseline values) were present in a 41.6% with mean peak value of hs T-Troponin at 24-hour (647±143 pg/ml). In-hospital mortality was 6.5% (13 pts, 69.2% in the CCU and 30.8% in the CL) for the whole population (cardiovascular cause in 53.8% with 4 deaths related to mechanical complications, 23% of sepsis, 15.4% of vascular complications, 7.6% due to AKI). Pts not presenting any complication during the stay in the CCU reached a 41%, resulting in CCU-stay shorter than 24 hours in 17.3% and shorter than 48 hours in 49.2%. Conclusions: Close monitoring of cardiac enzymes had major importance to determine the rate of peri-procedural myocardial infarction with known impact on outcomes. Main adverse outcomes in the CCU following TAVI presented early onset, including vascular complications and heart rhythm disturbances. Most pts did not present adverse events in the CCU suggesting that early discharge from the unit is feasible if free of events after 24 hours.

N2  - Background/Aims: Cardiorenal syndrome type 1 (CRS1) is a syndrome characterized by a rapid worsening of cardiac function leading to acute kidney injury (AKI). The aims of this study were to investigate the risk factors and the prognosis of CRS1 in elderly patients. Methods: A total of 312 elderly patients (≥60 years old) with acute heart failure (AHF) were studied. They were assigned as CRS1 (suffered from in-hospital AKI) or NCRS1 (without AKI) group. Clinical and laboratory data were recorded. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to clarify the risk factors for occurrence and mortality of CRS1 in this cohort. Results: Incidence of CRS1 was 52.56%. Basic estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR <60 ml/(min.1.73m2) and use of diuretics were associated with the higher risk of CRS1 in elderly patients (OR=2.239, P=0.025; OR=2.555, P=0.001; respectively). Whereas higher concentration of serum albumin was protective factor for them (OR=0.907, P=0.007). The in-hospital mortality of CRS1 was 23.2%. Dialysis, use of beta blockers or diuretics were associated with all-cause death of CRS1 patients (OR=10.407, P<0.001; OR=0.312, P=0.011; OR=0.345, P=0.040; respectively). The in-hospital mortality of AHF patients was 13.1%. Higher Charlson comorbidity index, occurrence of CRS1 and dialysis were risk factors for in-hospital mortality of AHF patients (OR=4.723, P=0.041; OR=6.096, P=0.008; OR=18.743, P<0.001; respectively). Conclusions: Incidence of CRS1 in elderly patients is relatively high and associated with poor outcome. Reduced basic eGFR, lower serum albumin and use of diuretics are risk factors for the occurrence of CRS1 in elderly patients, while use of diuretics, beta blockers and dialysis during hospitalization are predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with CRS1. These results above suggest that more suitable treatments for the elderly with CRS1 might be needed.

N2  - Older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience functional impairment that can complicate CKD management. Failure to recognize functional impairment may put these individuals at risk of further functional decline, nursing home placement, and missed opportunities for timely goals-of-care conversations. Routine geriatric assessment could be a useful tool for identifying older adults with CKD who are at risk of functional decline and provide contextual information to guide clinical decision-making. Two innovative programs were implemented in the Veterans Health Administration that incorporate geriatric assessment into a nephrology visit. In one program, a geriatrician embedded in a nephrology clinic used standardized geriatric assessment tools with individuals with CKD aged 70 and older (Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment for CKD) (CGA-4-CKD). In the second program, a nephrology clinic used comprehensive appointments for individuals aged 75 and older to conduct geriatric assessments and CKD care (Renal Silver). Data on 68 veterans who had geriatric assessments through these programs between November 2013 and May 2015 are reported. In CGA-4-CKD, difficulty with one or more activities of daily living (ADLs), history of falls, and cognitive impairment were each found in 27.3% of participants. ADL difficulty was found in 65.7%, falls in 28.6%, and cognitive impairment in 51.6% of participants in Renal Silver. Geriatric assessment guided care processes in 45.4% (n = 15) of veterans in the CGA-4-CKD program and 37.1% (n = 13) of those in Renal Silver. Findings suggest there is a significant burden of functional impairment in older adults with CKD. Knowledge of this impairment is applicable to CKD management.

N2  - Introduction: Malnutrition in elderly patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease (ACKD) is related to the development of frailty and the occurrence of adverse clinical outcomes. Objectives: To describe the nutritional status in patients with ACKD and evaluate the association between nutritional and clinical parameters. Methods: Patients ≥ 65 years old, assessed in ACKD clinics (not on dialysis) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 20 mL/min measured by CKD-EPI formula. Baseline variables: socio-demographic data, functional status (Barthel, Lawton, Functional Ambulation Classification), comorbidity (CIRS-G), etiology of kidney disease, anthropometric measurements, body mass index (BMI) using WHO and SENPE version (adapted to elderly), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Ulibarri scale and lab tests. Results: 80 patients, mean age 78.3 years (±7.4). MNA test showed normal nutritional status 62.5%. BMI (SENPE version) showed normal weight 76.3%. BMI (WHO version) showed normal weight 30%, overweight 50%. Ulibarri scale showed normal nutritional status 44.4%. Comparison of different nutritional assessments with clinical parameters, showed a significant association between normal nutritional situation, assessed using BMI (SENPE version) and MNA, with Barthel >80 (BMI SENPE: p = 0.02 and for MNA p = 0.03). Conclusions: There is a wide variability between tests for the assessment of nutritional status in the elderly. BMI (WHO version) may overestimate the rates of overweight in the elderly. An optimal nutritional status assessed by BMI and MNA, are associated with better functional situation.

N2  - Background Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is less defined. Methods TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR ≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality. Results A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767 (30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 (12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction, oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male sex. Conclusions Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

N2  - The population with end stage renal disease (ESRD) is becoming increasingly older and more frail with a high burden of comorbidities, resulting in increasingly more complex therapy decisions. From an ethical perspective the four principles by Beauchamp and Childress have to be considered: dialysis is only justified when patient autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence and justice are guaranteed. With respect to beneficence, the quality of life is becoming more important than a mere prolongation of life expectancy. A change in paradigm is noticeable: dialysis is to be offered to patients who are likely to benefit, otherwise conservative management should be considered, thus turning dialysis withdrawal and dialysis withholding into appropriate options. Advance care planning and shared decision-making allow early and ongoing involvement of the patient, supporting patient autonomy and beneficence. This communicative and processual approach requires an appropriate time frame and special communication skills as well as conflict management. In the case of conservative management in ESRD best supportive care at the end of life ensures fulfillment of the individual patient needs, symptom control and palliative care.

N2  - Elderly dialysis patients with multiple comorbidities often have poorer tolerance to hemodialysis treatment than younger patients. Typical complications, such as intradialytic hypotension, cramps, atrial fibrillation and post-dialysis fatigue contribute to a rapid loss of independence in this vulnerable patient population. The underlying etiology is a reduced tolerance to intravascular volume changes during dialysis, which is caused by impaired cardiovascular hemodynamic responses in combination with uremic and/or diabetic autonomous neuropathy. Significant reduction in organ perfusion occurring in the intestines, liver, kidneys, heart and brain contribute to the development of inflammation, malnutrition, heart failure, frailty, depression and dementia. To protect vulnerable elderly dialysis patients from these fatal complications of intradialytic tissue hypoxia, the prescription of hemodialysis needs to be individually adjusted in numerous aspects to the sensitivities of multimorbid elderly patients.

N2  - Background. Kidney transplantation offers improved survival and quality of life to an increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease. However, elderly kidney transplant recipients may face unique challenges due to a higher burden of comorbidity, greater cumulative risk of immunosuppression-related complications and increasing frailty. We aimed to describe the perspectives of elderly kidney transplant recipients. Methods. Electronic databases were searched to April 2015. Qualitative studies were eligible if they reported views from elderly kidney transplant recipients (≥60 years). Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the findings. Results. Twenty-one studies involving >116 recipients were included. We identified seven themes. 'Regaining strength and vitality' meant valuing the physical and psychosocial improvements in daily functioning and life participation. 'Extending life' was the willingness to accept any organ, including extended criteria kidneys, to prolong survival. 'Debt of gratitude' entailed conscious appreciation toward their donor while knowing they were unable to repay their sacrifice. 'Moral responsibility to maintain health' motivated adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations out of an ethical duty to protect their gift for graft survival. 'Unabating and worsening forgetfulness' hindered self-management. 'Disillusionment with side effects and complications' reflected disappointment and exasperation with the unintended consequences of medications. 'Finality of treatment option' was an acute awareness that the current transplant may be their last. Conclusions. Kidney transplantation was perceived to slow and even reverse the experience of aging among elderly recipients, especially compared with dialysis. However, some were frustrated over persistent limitations after transplant, struggled with the burden of medication side effects and worried about a possible return to dialysis if the transplant failed. Clarifying patient expectations of transplantation, providing support to alleviate the debilitating impacts of immunosuppression and addressing fears about deteriorating health and graft failure may improve satisfaction and outcomes in elderly kidney transplant recipients.

N2  - Aims To describe the characteristics and associated risk factors of patients with established diabetes who required Emergency Department (ED) care for severe hypoglycemia. Methods We performed an observational retrospective study to identify all cases of severe hypoglycemia among attendees at the EDs of three Italian University hospitals from January 2010 to December 2014. Results Overall, 520 patients with established diabetes were identified. Mean out-of-hospital blood glucose concentrations at the time of the hypoglycemic event were 2.2 ± 1.3 mmol/L. Most of these patients were frail and had multiple comorbidities. They were treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs (43.6%), insulin (42.8%), or both (13.6%). Among the oral hypoglycemic drugs, glibenclamide (54.5%) and repaglinide (25.7%) were the two most frequently used drugs, followed by glimepiride (11.3%) and gliclazide (7.5%). Hospitalization rates and in-hospital deaths occurred in 35.4% and in 2.3% of patients, respectively. Cirrhosis (odds ratio [OR] 6.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24–36.8, p < 0.05), chronic kidney disease (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.11–8.69, p < 0.05) and center (Sapienza University OR 3.70, 95% CI 1.57–8.69, p < 0.05) were the strongest predictors of increased rates of hospital admission. Conclusions Severe hypoglycemia is a remarkable burden for patients with established diabetes and increases the risk of adverse clinical outcomes (in-hospital death and hospitalization), mainly in elderly and frail patients. This study further reinforces the notion that careful attention should be taken by health care providers when they prescribe drug therapy in elderly patients with serious comorbidities.

N2  - Background: Dialysis in elderly patients (>80-years-old) carries a poor prognosis, but little is known about the most effective vascular access method in this age group. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is both time-consuming and initially expensive, requiring surgical insertion. A central venous catheter (CVC) is initially a cheaper alternative, but carries a higher risk of infection. We examined whether vascular access affected 1-year and 2-year mortality in elderly patients commencing haemodialysis. Methods: Initial vascular access, demographic and survival data for elective haemodialysis patients >80-years was collated using regional databases. A cohort of conservatively managed patients was included for comparison. A log-rank test was used to compare survival between groups and a chi-square test was used to compare 1-year and 2-year survival. Results: 167 patients (61% male) were included: CVC (101), AVF (25) and conservative management (41). Mean age (median) of starting haemodialysis (eGFR ≤10mL/min/1.73m2): CVC; 83.4 (2.3) and AVF; 82.3 (1.8). Mean age of conservatively managed patients reaching an eGFR ≤10mL/min/1.73m2 was 85.8 (3.6). Mean (median) survival on dialysis was 2.2 (1.8) years for AVF patients, 2.1 (1.2) for CVC patients, and 1.5 (0.9) for conservatively managed patients (p = 0.107, controlling for age/sex p = 0.519). 1-year and 2-year mortality: AVF (28%/52%); CVC (49%/57%), and conservative management (54%/68%). There was no significant difference between the groups at 1-year (p = 0.108) or 2-years (p = 0.355). Conclusion: These results suggest that there is no significant survival benefit over a 2-year period when comparing vascular access methods. In comparison to conservative management, survival benefit was marginal. The decision of whether and how (choice of their vascular access method) to dialysis the over 80s is multifaceted and requires a tailored, multidisciplinary approach.

N2  - Background: The number of elderly and long-term dialysis patients in Japan is increasing, raising new problems such as muscle weakening and impaired activity of daily life (ADL). Such conditions have also been reported to decrease patient QOL. Exercise training in frail dialysis patients has been reported to improve physical performance and QOL. Aim: To evaluate physical performance and quality of life (QOL) in regularly visiting hemodialysis patients at our hospital. Safety and effect of exercise during hemodialysis (EDH) in the short term was also evaluated. Methods: We evaluated physical performance using Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score and health-related QOL using SF12. EDH was planned and executed by the hemodialysis staff including physical therapists. It aimed mainly to train trunk muscles and antigravity muscles and was composed by a choice from several exercise menus. SPPB score and SF-12 was evaluated after 9months of EDH. Results: Thirteen patients (7 male, average age 69.8 years, average SPPB score 8.8) agreed to cross-sectional evaluation, and 4 of them (2 male, average age 68.9 years) started EDH, and 4 (3 male, average 74.8 years) started voluntary training on non-dialysis days. EDH was performed without major side effects. Patients who started EDH and voluntary training had higher SPPB score after 9months rehabilitation than initial status, whereas none in the non-exercise group improved. However, training did not show consistent effect on QOL score. Conclusions: We found that most patients had low SPPB and QOL scores. Exercise in any form may improve physical performance but improvement in QOL needs additional interventions.

N2  - Purpose: Prognosis of the increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is poor with high risk of functional decline and mortality. Frailty seems to be a good predictor for those patients that will not benefit from dialysis. Varying prevalences between populations are probably related to the instrument used. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of frailty among ESRD patients with two different validated instruments. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients, aged ≥18 years, receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis care between September 2013 and December 2013 in a single dialysis center in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. Frailty was measured with the frailty index (FI) and frailty phenotype (FP). Results: Prevalence of frailty by the FI was 36.8 % among 95 participants with ESRD (age: 65.2 years, SD ± 12.0). Frailty prevalence among participants aged ≥65 and <65 years was 43.6 and 27.5 %, respectively. Female sex [odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.3–8.0] and a Charlson comorbidity index score of ≥5 (OR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.0–6.6) were associated with frailty. The FI identified different but overlapping participants as frail compared with the FP; 62.5 % of frail participants according to FI were also frail according to the FP. Conclusions: Prevalence of frailty among young and elderly ESRD patients is high; being female and having more comorbidity was associated with frailty. Use of a broader definition of frailty, like the FI, gives a higher estimation of prevalence among ESRD patients compared with a physical frailty assessment.

N2  - Background Patient-centered quality outcomes such as disposition after surgery are increasingly being scrutinized. Preoperative factors predictive of nonhome discharge (DC) may identify at-risk patients for targeted interventions. This study examines the association among preoperative risk factors, frailty, and nonhome DC after elective vascular surgery procedures in patients living at home. Methods The 2011–2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was queried to identify all home-dwelling patients who underwent elective vascular procedures (endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair, suprainguinal and infrainguinal bypasses, peripheral endovascular interventions, carotid endarterectomy, and stent). Preoperative frailty was measured using the modified frailty index (mFI; derived from Canadian Study of Health and Aging). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association of frailty and nonhome DC. Results Of 15,843 home-dwelling patients, 1,177 patients (7.4%) did not return home postoperatively. Frailty (mFI > 0.25) conferred a significantly increased 2-fold risk of nonhome DC disposition for each procedure type. Frailty, female gender, open procedures, increasing age, end-stage renal disease, and occurrence of any postoperative complication were associated with increased risk of nonhome DC. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, frailty increased the odds of nonhome DC by 60% (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4–1.8) after adjusting for other covariates. In the presence of complications, the risk of nonhome DC was 27.5% in frail versus 16.5% in nonfrail patients (P < 0.001). In the absence of complications, although absolute risk was lower, frail patients were nearly twice as likely to not return home (frail 5.5% vs. nonfrail 2.75%, P < 0.001). Conclusions Frail home-dwelling patients undergoing elective vascular procedures are at high risk of not returning home after surgery. Preoperative frailty assessment appears to hold potential for counseling regarding postsurgery disposition and DC planning.

N2  - Importance: Efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on patients with cancer. High-quality end-of-life care is also critical for patients with other illnesses. Objective: To compare patterns of end-of-life care and family-rated quality of care for patients dying with different serious illnesses. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cross-sectional studywas conducted in all 146 inpatient facilities within the Veteran Affairs health system among patients who died in inpatient facilities between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2012, with clinical diagnoses categorized as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cancer, cardiopulmonary failure (congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), dementia, frailty, or other conditions. Data analysis was conducted from April 1, 2014, to February 10, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Palliative care consultations, do-not-resuscitate orders, death in inpatient hospices, death in the intensive care unit, and family-reported quality of end-of-life care. Results: Among 57 753 decedents, approximately half of the patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty received palliative care consultations (adjusted proportions, 50.4%, 46.7%, and 43.7%, respectively) vs 73.5% of patients with cancer and 61.4% of patients with dementia (P < .001). Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty (adjusted proportions, 32.3%, 34.1%, and 35.2%, respectively) died in the intensive care unit, more than double the rates among patients with cancer and those with dementia (13.4% and 8.9%, respectively) (P < .001). Rates of excellent quality of end-of-life care reported by 34 005 decedents' families were similar for patients with cancer and those with dementia (adjusted proportions, 59.2% and 59.3%; P = .61), but lower for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty (54.8%, 54.8%, and 53.7%, respectively; all P ≤ .02 vs patients with cancer). This quality advantage was mediated by palliative care consultation, setting of death, and a code status of do-not-resuscitate; adjustment for these variables rendered the association between diagnosis and overall end-of-life care quality nonsignificant. Conclusions and Relevance: Family-reported quality of end-of-life carewas significantly better for patients with cancer and those with dementia than for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty, largely owing to higher rates of palliative care consultation and do-not-resuscitate orders and fewer deaths in the intensive care unit among patients with cancer and those with dementia. Increasing access to palliative care and goals of care discussions that address code status and preferred setting of death, particularly for patients with end-organ failure and frailty, may improve the overall quality of end-of-life care for Americans dying of these illnesses.

N2  - Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However, surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical motion.

N2  - Renovascular disease (RVD) can lead to hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with advanced peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have a 5-year mortality of 1/430%. Rate and causes of death in patients with significant RVD, who share similar risk factors with patients having PAD, are not well defined. We assessed consecutive patients with RVD who underwent renal artery stenting at our institution over 6 years. Specific causes of death were ascertained, and the probability of survival was estimated. Cox models were fit to identify predictors of outcomes. We identified 281 patients with RVD who underwent renal stenting. Follow-up was available for all patients (median 5.1 years). All-cause mortality was 24.2% at 5 years and 33.7% at 7 years (compounded annualized death rate: 5.5%). Of the 68 deaths, 36 (52.9%) were cardiovascular (13.2% acute myocardial infarction, 13.2% stroke, 11.8% sudden death, and 10.3% congestive heart failure) and 32 (47.1%) deaths had noncardiovascular causes. In patients with RVD undergoing stenting, cardiovascular events are the most common causes of death. Compared to patients with advanced PAD, RVD may have a lower 5-year mortality.

N2  - Exercise, nutritional intervention, and psycho-social care are complimentary therapeutic options in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Beyond regulatory guidelines for dialysis treatment this approach focuses on enhancing the quality of life and survival. Both, exercise and nutritional intervention, might significantly prevent complications of CKD as immobility, malnutrition, and frailty. Psycho-social support helps patients in coping with their symptoms by assisting them in matters of social care and regulatory caregiving. Financial resources, staff qualification and barriers in the implementary process are discussed by reviewing the current practice of a non-profit organization (Kuratorium für Dialyse und Nierentransplantation).

N2  - Background: While transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) effectively alleviates valve-related symptoms and restores quality of life, several patients remain frail and in a vulnerable clinical condition after technically successful TAVI. Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess frequency and indication for hospital readmission within the first year after TAVI. Methods: Between August 2007 and June 2014, 900 consecutive patients with symptomatic, severe aortic Stenosis received TAVI using different access routes and devices and were included into the prospective institutional TAVI registry. Prospective follow-up was scheduled at 30 days and 1 year. All hospital readmissions were collected and major adverse events were adjudicated according to the VARC2 standardized endpoint definitions. Results: Of 900 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI, 868 (96.4%) patients were alive at hospital discharge. Of these, 221 patients (25.4%) were readmitted within the first year after TAVI and included in this analysis. Compared with patients not requiring readmission, those with at least one readmission were more frequently male (55.8% vs. 47.5%, p=0.035), presented more frequently with atrial fibrillation (39.1% vs. 29.2%, p=0.01), and had higher creatinine values (111.0±64 vs. 99.7±46, p=0.007) at baseline. Overall, 308 readmissions occurred during the observational period with a cumulative mean hospital duration of 14.1±16 days. Among readmitted patients, 142 patients (46.1%) were re-evaluated for cardiovascular causes (1.3% for valvular heart disease), 30 (9.7%) for gastrointestinal, 14 (4.6%) for respiratory and 8 patients (2.6%) for chronic kidney disease. Thirtysix patients (11.7%) received non-cardiac surgery and 15 patients (4.9%) were found to have a malignant tumor within the first year after TAVI. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that in-hospital stroke (HR 2.57, 95% CI 1.36-4.87, p=0.004) and in-hospital stage 3 acute renal failure (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.10-3.82, p=0.023) were independent predictors of any rehospitalization; history of previous myocardial infarction (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.12-2.71, p=0.014), in-hospital stroke (HR 2.90, 95% CI 1.27-6.64, p=0.012) and in-hospital life-threatening bleeding (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.23-4.02, p=0.008) were associated with higher risk of rehospitalizations for cardiovascular causes. Conclusions: Among patients undergoing TAVI, one out of four experienced at least one rehospitalization within the first year after the procedure. The most commen causes for readmission are cardiovascular, while readmission for valve related issues is rare. Patients undergoing TAVI complicated by stroke or acute renal failure are at increased risk for readmission.

N2  - Background: Increasing the weekly frequency of hemodialysis sessions has positive effects, on the control of several biological data of patients. However, knowledge about Daily HemoDialysis (DHD) practices is limited in France. The aim of the present study was to describe the characteristics and treatment trajectories of all French patients undergoing DHD. Methods: All patients older than 18 years who started DHD between 2003 and 2012 in France were included and followed until December 31, 2013. The patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment modalities were extracted from the French Renal Epidemiological and Information Network (REIN) registry. Results: During the inclusion period, 753 patients started DHD in France. Based on their median age (64 years), patients were classified in two groups: "old" group (≥64 years) and "young" group (<64 years). Patients in the old group had more comorbidities than in the young group: 48 % had diabetes (vs 29 % in the young group), 17 % an active malignancy (vs 10 %) and 80 % ≥1 cardiovascular disease (vs 41 %). Concerning patients' treatment trajectories, 496 (66 %) patients started with another dialysis before switching to DHD and 257 (34 %) directly with DHD. At the end of the follow-up, 69 % of patients in the old group were dead (27.4 % in the young group) and kidney transplantation was more frequent in the young group (30.4 % vs 0.5 %). Conclusion: In France, DHD is proposed not only to young in rather good clinical conditions and waiting for kidney transplantation, but also to old and frail patients with higher mortality.

N2  - Background: Among kidney transplant (KT) recipients, frailty increases the risk of DGF, early hospital readmission, MMF intolerance and mortality. While it is clear that frail KT recipients represent a high risk group, the frailty correlates and high-risk patterns of the frailty components are unclear. Furthermore, it is unclear the best way to measure frailty in KT recipients of all ages. Materials and Methods: 663 KT recipients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study (12/2008-8/2015) at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Fried frailty phenotype (5 components: weight loss, poor grip strength, low activity, exhaustion and slowed walk speed), activities of daily living (ADL)/ instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) disability, Centers for Epidemiologic Studied-Depression Scale (CESD), education and health related quality of life (HRQOL) were measured at evaluation and KT admission. Additionally, age, sex, race, obesity status, smoking status, time on dialysis, cause of ESRD and donor type were also ascertained from the medical record. We used adjusted multinomial regression to identify frailty correlates. We identified which pattern of the 5 components was associated with mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Among KT recipients 19.1% were frail. The only factors associated with frailty status were older age (≥65) (2.11, 95%CI:1.16- 3.85), IADL disability (3.21, 95%CI:1.66-6.22), CESD depressive symptoms (11.87, 95%CI:4.33-32.58), less than a high school education (3.66, 95% CI:1.54-8.73) and HRQOL (Good: 2.95, 95%CI:1.36-6.43 and Fair/Poor: 3.62, 95%CI:1.66-7.88). The most common pattern of the 5 components was poor grip strength, low physical activity and slowed walk speed (19.4%) among KT recipients. KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed walking speed (HR=2.41, 95%CI:1.17-5.01, P=0.02) and poor grip strength, exhaustion and slowed walking speed (HR=2.48, 95%CI:1.09-5.64, P=0.02) were at increased mortality risk. Discussion: Frailty is common among KT recipients of all ages. Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty; however, factors rarely measured as part of clinical practice, namely HRQOL, IADL disability and depressive symptoms, were significant correlates of frailty among KT recipients. Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged as having the strongest association with post-KT mortality. Conclusion: Frailty is a novel risk factor among KT recipients and not all of the 5 components may be relevant for risk prediction in the population. (Table Presented).

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent in the United States and throughout the world1 with approximately 13% of adults affected.2 In addition, according to recent estimates, almost half of patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 are 70 years of age and older.2 In the United States, the number of prevalent end-stage renal disease cases continues to increase in patients older than age 65. In light of the demographic characteristics of patients with CKD and ESRD, there has been considerable focus on associations between CKD and cardiovascular outcomes.3 Until recently, less attention had been paid to other consequences of CKD in general and among older individuals with CKD in particular, but there is now solid evidence linking CKD with impairments of physical function, cognitive function, and emotional function and quality of life. This review summarizes available literature on these topics, focusing specifically on physical functioning and frailty, cognitive function, emotional health, including depression and anxiety, and health-related quality of life.

N2  - Kidney transplant patients with failed allografts who have returned to dialysis have more difficulty establishing access and are more likely to suffer from central venous catheter (CVC)-related complications. The recent addition of Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWNWeb) data to the USRDS allows more granular analysis of dialysis care, including vascular access use. We sought to describe AVF maturation from placement until time to first use for prevalent hemodialysis patients with failed kidney transplants in the US. Methods: We examined prevalent hemodialysis patients with previous failed kidney transplants who had new AVF placements during 2013 using Medicare claims. Failure of maturation was identified by nonuse following placement using CROWNWeb, where patient access use is reported monthly by the facility. Patients were followed until end 2014. We assessed the relationship between patient characteristics and time-to-first-use of AVF with a Cox model (HR < 1.0 indicating longer time to first use). Results: In 2013, a total of 1353 AVF were placed among 1186 failed kidney transplant patients followed through 2014. No subsequent evidence of use occurred in 34.4% of the placements. Of successfully used AVF, median time to first use was 108 days (IQR 70 - 209). AVF in females were associated with longer time to AVF use (HR 0.68, 95%CI 0.59-0.79), as were AVF in black patients (HR 0.84, 95%CI 0.71-0.98). Comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98), diabetes (HR 0.85, 95%CI 0.72-0.99), tobacco use (HR 0.69, 95%CI 0.51-0.94), and needing assistance (HR 0.57, 95%CI 0.40-0.82) had similar association with increased time to AVF use. Patient age, dialysis vintage, hypertensive history, and ESRD Network Region associations with AVF maturation were mostly non-significant, as was previous dialysis access history. Conclusions: We have characterized AVF maturation in the subset of failed kidney transplant patients in a national sample and identified important associations with multiple patient-level factors. Patients who were female, black, frail, smokers, or had cardiovascular or diabetic disease required additional time for maturation, suggesting that such patients may require earlier referral as part of their access placement plan. Research is urgently required into the importance of patient, region, and practice factors that could improve AVF placement and maturation, decrease CVC use, and improve outcomes in patients with failed kidney transplants.

N2  - Geriatric syndrome is common among older patients on dialysis. Basic knowledge about its prevalence and management is crucial for nephrologists to provide standard patient care. In busy clinical settings, up-to-date and holistic medical care can be delivered to elderly dialysis patients by collaboration of nephrology and geriatrics teams, or in part by training nephrology fellows the basics of geriatrics.

While it is clear that frail KT recipients represent a high risk group, the correlates of frailty and whether there are high-risk patterns of the frailty components is unclear. Which components of frailty are relevant to KT recipients of all ages is unclear. Methods: 693 KT recipients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study (12/2008- 10/2015) at Johns Hopkins Hospital.

The only factors associated with frailty status were older age (≥65) (2.21, 95%CI:1.22-4.01), IADL disability (3.34, 95%CI:3.28-21.27), CESD depressive symptoms (8.35, 95%CI:3.28-21.27), <high school education (2.89, 95% CI:1.22-6.83) and excellent/very good HRQOL (2.89, 95%CI:1.22-6.83). The most common pattern of the 5 components was poor grip strength, low physical activity and slowed walk speed (18.9%). KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed walking speed (HR=2.41, 95%CI:1.17-5.01, P=0.02) and poor grip strength, exhaustion and slowed walking speed (HR=2.48, 95%CI:1.09- 5.64, P=0.02) were at increased mortality risk. Conclusion: Frailty is common in KT recipients of all ages. While age contributed to the burden of frailty, factors that are often not measured as part of clinical practice, HRQOL, ADL/IADL disability and depressive symptoms, were strong correlates of frailty. The components of frailty may need to be redefined or updated to capture risk in adults of all ages undergoing KT. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Nowadays Germany has the lowest rate of usage of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in Europe. The precise rate is, if all renal replacement therapies are taken into account, 3.5%. The major cause for that low number is, that with an increasingly aging population the modality of assisted PD is not sufficiently supported. However, in Germany no incentives are offered to augment that segment and additionally, the reimbursement system spans not the assisted PD. On the international level, we are on the last positions regarding use of PD. Compared to that, in the US the usage of PD increased in the last years, although the population is aging too with increasing comorbidities. This shows that with keeping the framework around in adjustment with the needs, also PD as a modality can be offered to a aging population with comorbidities. If life quality, autonomy and preference of the patient is taken into account, the example of the US should be followed and also in Germany, we should see increasingly more PD patients in the near future.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The prevalence of CKD increases sharply with age such that almost 50% of people aged over 70 years are affected (based on current definitions), but only a minority progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It is therefore important to have an accurate method to predict risk of progression in older people so that high risk persons can be identified earlier to allow adequate time for preparation for possible renal replacement therapy (RRT) whereas those at low risk can be spared unnecessary preparation. We therefore sought to identify the most reliable risk prediction equation for use in older people. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed Central and MEDLINE. The following definitions were applied: Elderly - older than 65 years; advanced CKD - eGFR <45ml/min/1.73m2; progression of CKD - progression to CKD stage 5 (category G5), a point which would generally prompt initiation of discussing eventual RRT. The abstracts of all papers were assessed independently by two assessors to identify papers for detailed review and data extraction. Differences were resolved by discussion. Results: The literature search identified 960 papers, 64 were selected for detailed review and 10 for data extraction. We identified 3 prospective and 5 retrospective cohort studies that aimed to identify risk factors and/or develop a risk prediction score for progression to ESKD in predominantly older people. Six studies were excluded from further consideration because they did not attempt to develop a risk prediction score, they had significant selection bias or missing data. A retrospective study that included data from predominantly male patients at a Veterans Administration (VA) Medical Centre performed well but did not include a measure of proteinuria and has not been validated in general populations. The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) was developed in Canadian adults who were referred to Nephrologists with eGFR 10-59ml/ min/1.73m2. The 8-variable KFRE achieved excellent discrimination in development (C statistic=0.917) and validation cohorts (C statistic=0.841) and a 4-variable KFRE performed almost as well. The KFRE has recently been validated in a large dataset (CKD Prognosis Consortium) that included 721,357 individuals with CKD Stages 3-5 from 31 cohort studies. The 4-variable KFRE achieved excellent discrimination with a pooled C statistic of 0.90 at 2 years and 0.88 at 5 years. Discrimination was similar in subgroups aged ≥65 years versus younger for both the 4- and 8-variable KFRE. To improve calibration in non-American populations, a correction factor was applied. Further subgroup analysis confirmed good discrimination in people aged >65 years with eGFR<45ml/min/1.73m2. (Tangri N et al. Multinational Assessment of Accuracy of Equations for Predicting Risk of Kidney Failure: A Meta-analysis. JAMA 315 (2):164-74; 2016) Conclusions: We recommend that the 4-variable Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) performs sufficiently well for use in older patients with CKD and GFR<45ml/min/ 1.73m2. The 4-variable KFRE is preferable as it is likely that the laboratory data required (eGFR and urine ACR) will be available in a much greater proportion of older people with CKD.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: End-stage renal disease patients under dialysis presented an enhanced inflammatory and oxidative stress process, and metabolic disturbances, which contribute to the development of frailty. Being associated with decreased quality of life and increased risk of hospitalization, institutionalization and death. Considering the lack of information about frailty in ESRD patients under dialysis, the aims of this work was to evaluate the prevalence of frailty in these patients, and its association with socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers, as well as with quality of life and comorbidities. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, mean [± SD] age: 64.3 [±14.6] years) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire. Moreover, it was also evaluated the social support and quality of life, as well as data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory markers. Results: We found in our group of ESRD patients a prevalence of pre-frailty and frailty of 54.2% (n=45) and 28.9% (n=24), respectively. When compared the 3 groups of patients (robust, pre-frail and frail), we found a significant increase in proportion of female, diabetes and hypertension in frail group. A significant increase in ferritin level, global deterioration scale score, Beck depression inventory scale score and Charlson comorbidity index score; and a decrease in haemoglobin concentration, iron, transferrin and albumin serum levels, and in mini mental state examination scale score and in physical and mental components summaries of quality of life, were found in frail patients. Moreover, we also found a negative significant correlation between frailty scale score and mini mental state examination scale score, global deterioration scale score, albumin, iron, physical and mental components summary of quality of life and interdialytic weight gain; and a positive significant correlation with depression symptoms and comorbidities. Conclusions: In conclusion, our results showed that frailty is a high prevalent condition in ESRD patients under dialysis, particularly in older female patients, which is associated with a decrease in quality of life, cognitive function, nutritional status and with increased depressive symptoms and comorbidities.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) suffer a decline in physical capacity which results in disability and lost independence which can largely be prevented by physical exercise. Vibration exercise is a novel protocol to prevent loss of muscle mass and bone mineralization during prolonged immobility. Short sessions of Whole Body Vibration Exercise (WBVE) may be easy to integrate into the dialysis schedule with minimal time and staff input. It is a form of 'passive' exercise which utilises high frequency vibration of muscle groups resulting in high levels of muscle contraction and motor unit recruitment. Although WBVE has been shown to benefit frail elderly patients' rehabilitation, there has yet to be studies undertaken in the dialysis population. We present a pilot study of 8 weeks WBVE for 3 minutes prior to thrice weekly dialysis sessions. Methods: All dialysis patients in NHS Fife were assessed for the study subject to exclusion criteria. Recruited subjects had baseline investigations repeated one month apart prior, then after 8 weeks of exercise intervention. Measures: Sit to stand test STS-60, Tinetti balance, Hand grip strength, Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) Skinfold, Calf Circumference, Upper arm circumference Alkaline Phosphatase, Ca , Phosphate, Parathyroid Hormone Protein Catabolic Rate Urea Reduction Ratio (URR) KDQoL score. Results: From the total haemodialysis population of 162 , 89 (55%) expressed an interest although, 27 (30%) were ineligible. Of the 62 remaining patients 49 enrolled in the study (22 females, 27 males). Age varied from 24 - 92, median 70 years. Time on dialysis varied from <1 - 14 5months, median 33 months. 25 patients completed all assessments and 24 withdrew, 15 for medical reasons (1 died, 2 transplanted, 5 adverse events), 2 for technical reasons and 7 'other'. 21 patients (56%) completed the minimum number of 20 exercise session intervention to be included in the analysis. Following the 8-week intervention only the STS-60 improved significantly by about 11%, P=0.002. Analysis of covariance showed no significant relationships between the change of physical measures and age, gender or months on haemodialysis after allowance for initial level of any of the physical outcome measures. Of the quality of life KDQOL domains scored, only the “symptoms listed” and “health overall”l improved significantly following the 8-week exercise period . 5.7 p=0.050 and 5.5 p =0.024 respectively The Urea Reduction Ratio (URR), Markers of bone health and the protein catabolic rate did not differ significantly following exercise. Conclusions: We have shown that WBVE was conveniently incorporated into patients attendance for haemodialysis sessions. WBVE was well tolerated and safe. We have provided key information for planning further studies on the suitability of our methodology in a robust RCT comparing WBVE with other modalities of exercise (e.g. self managed rather than supervised exercise) and in comparing levels of intensity of vibration exercise necessary to achieve health gain. Finally, other studies might be devised to identify the usefulness of WBVE for maintaining physical function in new dialysis patients in whom evidence suggests will physical function deteriorates following initiation of dialysis.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Complications involving malnutrition or protein-energy status are common in CKD patients and greatly contributes to morbidity and mortality. Adequate assessment and management of malnutrition are unmet needs in this population. There is an urgent need for an evidenced-based approach to the identification and management of malnutrition in elderly/frail patients with advanced CKD (eGFR < 45ml/min/1.73m2) and in those on dialysis. Methods: The EBPG group carried out a systematic review to determine which nutritional interventions are effective in improving nutritional status in elderly patients (>65 years) with advanced CKD. 1,028 papers were retrieved; 94 (9.1%) selected for full text assessment, and 23 selected for quality assessment and data extraction. Among the remaining studies, only 5 were RCT's, the majority being prospective observational, cross-sectional, or cohort studies. Results: There was no consensus on the definition of nutritional status or on the nutritional parameters which are relevant or need to be addressed in this population. This has resulted in different outcomes being reported as clinical end points in different studies. The majority of studies used biochemical (serum albumin) or clinical (SGA) outcome measures. The main interventions studied were nutritional supplements (oral or intravenous) or pharmacological. Oral nutritional supplements were commonly used, the nature of the supplement differing from study to study and included oral amino acids, mixtures of protein, carbohydrate and fat, and bicarbonate. The same variability was also noted for intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN). Significant improvements of nutritional parameters in response to these interventions were generally reported, mainly increased serum albumin, SGA, or nutritional index. The effects of pharmacological interventions, such as rhGH or nandrolone decanoate, are essentially anecdotal. Dietetic care may be useful throughout the course of CKD. However, there is no definitive evidence of effect of reported interventions on mortality rate. Conclusions: Oral supplements or IDPN may be useful to improve nutritional status in elderly/frail patients with advanced CKD or on dialysis. IDPN seems not to be superior to oral supplementation. There are insufficient data to suggest a pharmacological intervention in this field. Dietary counselling should be part of routine pre-ESRD care.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide especially among elderly population. Approximately 25% of the dialysis population is 80 years old and more. Frailty is a health condition associated with the ageing process. The relationship between frailty and CKD in elderly population has been recognised and some studies have demonstrated frailty as a predictor of adverse outcome especially among haemodialysis patients. However studies concentrating on frailty in pre-dialysis patients are limited. The aim of this study was to assess prevalence and predictors of frailty in an elderly pre-dialysis population. Methods: A cross-observational study was conducted in which 108 patients aged 65 years or above with an eGFR of 25mlor less were included. Data including age, sex, FBC, CRP, ferritin, renal function, calcium, albumin, PTH and co-morbidities were collected at baseline and at 3 months interval for one year. Functional performance was assessed using Karnofsky scale. Frailty was assessed using combination of PRISMA questionnaire and Timed up and Go test (TUGT). Results: A frail group (n=61; male =31, female=30) and a non-frail group (n=47; male=20, female=27) were identified. Frailty was prevalent in 53.6% of selected population. Multiple regression analysis was used to compare different variables to frailty. Functional performance was significantly lower in the frail group compared to non-frail (P=0.0001). No significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age (P=0.8), sex(P=0.6), haemoglobin (P=0.2), white blood cells(P=0.4), CRP(P=0.9), Ferritin(P=0.4), Calcium(P=0.2), Albumin(P=0.3), change in creatinine (P=0.9), PTH (P=0.3) or number of co-morbidities(P=0.8)were seen. Conclusions: Prevalence of frailty is high amongst elderly pre-dialysis patients. These patients have lower functional performance. Anemia, Calcium homeostasis and inflammatory markers do not predict frailty. As many of these patients will go on to have renal replacement and worsening of their physical parameters it is important that frailty is recognised in these patients at the pre-dialysis stage.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The optimal blood pressure treatment target in older individuals is controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the balance of benefits and harms of more intensive blood pressure treatment in adults over age 60. METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases through January 2015, and updated our search for large blood pressure treatment trials through November 2015. To assess health outcomes, we included trials of hypertensive adults with mean age over 60 comparing different blood pressure treatment targets, or more versus less intensive treatment strategies. We included trials or observational studies examining potential long-term harms such as cognitive function, falls, and fractures. Two investigators used established criteria to independently assess the risk of bias of included studies, and the strength of evidence (SOE) supporting each finding. We conducted meta-analyses using the profile-likelihood random-effects model to assess all-cause mortality, fatal/non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and fatal/non-fatal stroke. We used Cochran's chi-square test and the I2 statistic to assess statistical heterogeneity. We qualitatively synthesized results for all other outcomes. RESULTS: We reviewed 10,627 titles and abstracts, selected 319 for full-text review, and included 21 trials and 3 observational studies that provided relevant primary data. Across 20 trials, more intensive treatment reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95 % CI 0.85-0.96; I2 = 29 %), fatal/nonfatal MI (RR 0.80, 95 % CI 0.74-0.86; I2 = 14 %), and fatal/non-fatal stroke (RR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.71-0.83; I2 = 14 %) compared to less intensive treatment (moderate SOE). Most of the benefit was contributed by studies in which patients achieved systolic blood pressures above 140 mmHg and had baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 160 mmHg. Low SOE from five treat-to-target trials comparing SBP targets <140 mmHg or lower to higher targets, showed no consistent impact on mortality reduction (RR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.68-1.13; I2 = 28 %), but a stronger-albeit nonsignificant- trend toward fatal/nonfatal MI reduction (RR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.68- 1.08,I2 = 0 %), and fatal/non-fatal stroke reduction (RR 0.79, 95 % CI 0.56-1.03, I2 = 32 %) (low SOE). In patients with prior stroke, moderate SOE showed that targeting SBP as low as 130 mmHg reduced stroke (RR 0.76, 95 % CI 0.67-0.85, I2 = 0 %) and fatal/non-fatal MI (RR 0.78, 95 % CI 0.63-0.96, I2 = 0 %), but not all-cause mortality (RR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.86-1.12, I2=0 %). More patients (RR ranged 1.44-2.00) assigned intensive blood pressure treatment withdrew due to adverse events, most frequently cough and hypotension (low SOE). More intensive treatment did not increase the risk of cognitive impairment (7 trials, moderate SOE), falls or fractures (3 trials, moderate SOE), advanced kidney disease (12 trials, low SOE), or worsen quality of life (4 trials, moderate SOE). We found insufficient evidence to determine how age and comorbidity burden affected treatment outcomes. Patients with frailty, dementia, advanced chronic kidney disease, and other life-limiting comorbidities such as cancer and liver disease were excluded from most trials. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, the first to our knowledge to incorporate the recently published SPRINT trial, we found overall that lowering blood pressure over 2- 5 years in older patients reduces all-cause mortality (NNT of about 80-90, across different sensitivity analyses), fatal/non-fatal MI (NNT 80-110), and fatal/non-fatal stroke (NNT 80-90). We found most of this benefit in trials of patients with higher baseline SBP (>160 mmHg) achieving moderate levels of blood pressure control (>140 mmHg). We found that more aggressive treatment (targets below SBP 140 mmHg) had the potential to reduce MI and stroke occurrence in patients with mild hypertension, but the absolute effect was smaller (NNT of about 200). Moreover, the effect estimates were less precise and did not reach statistical significance, likely because there were fewer trials, relatively low event rates in several of the trials, and inconsistencies in findings among these trials. The SPRINT trial provided the most substantial evidence of benefit among the treat-to-target trials. Whether this was related to the higher cardiovascular risk profile of the patient population is unclear, as we found inconsistent results among three trials conducting subgroup analyses according to cardiovascular risk profile. While more aggressive blood pressure treatment was associated with higher medication burden and increased rates of adverse events such as hypotension, it did not increase the risk of longer term harms such as cognitive impairment or falls. The lack of evidence that blood pressure lowering among older adults causes long-term harms may provide some comfort and flexibility for providers to work with patients in crafting individualized treatment plans. There is little data to assess the balance of risks and benefits of antihypertensive treatment among the frail elderly.

N2  - Both low (≤ 4.0 mEq/L) and high (≥ 5.6 mEq/L) predialysis serum potassium concentrations are associated with increased morbidity and mortality among hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, there is controversy regarding the optimal dialysate potassium to prescribe for specific predialysis serum potassium concentrations. In an analysis of baseline values, DOPPS investigators reported that the increased mortality risk among patients with high predialysis serum potassium concentrations was similar when dialyzed with dialysate potassium concentrations of 2.0 vs. 3.0 mEq/L. However, Kovesdy et al. reported that among patients with predialysis hyperkalemia a high dialysate potassium was associated with increased mortality. In contrast, Karnik et al. have cautioned that a high serum-dialysate gradient is associated with an increased risk of sudden death. To address this ongoing controversy we conducted a retrospective, study of 32,000 HD patients with 773,000 patient-months of follow-up. To assess the relationships of serum and dialysate potassium concentrations to hospitalization we constructed time varying proportional hazards models for recurrent events. To assess the relationships to mortality we constructed frailty models with clinics included as a random effect. (Figure Presented) Both models included adjustments for demographics, cause of ESRD and time varying Hgb, and serum albumin lagged by 2 months. The adjusted hazard ratios for hospitalization and mortality associated with given serum potassium levels, stratified by dialysate potassium concentrations are shown. Serum potassium but not dialysate potassium was an independent risk factor for both hospitalization and mortality. There were no significant interactions between serum and dialysate potassium in either model.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: It is unclear whether dialysis can extend life in frail elderly patients or in which subgroups the burden balances the advantages. We therefore undertook a review of the literature around the benefits of dialysis in the frail & elderly to produce guidelines to support shared decision-making on this difficult clinical decision. Methods: A systematic literature review from 1990 to 2015 identified 853 potentially relevant papers, none of them RCTs. 13 comparative cohort studies (conservative management [CM] vs dialysis), 5 cohort studies of CMalone in advanced CKD and 2 systematic reviews fulfilled the search criteria. Studies of cohorts of elderly and/or frail patients receiving dialysis with no comparator were excluded as these are well reported by Registries. Results: Our review identified studies of variable size and quality totalling 1245 patients having received CM and 2338 patients having received dialysis or on dialysis pathway. Patients receiving CM were in general older, more co-morbid & of poorer functional status than dialysis-destined patients. All studies were confounded by lack of a clear definition of CM, & lack of clear criteria from which to measure survival between cohorts. Patient groups were defined by differing ages & levels of renal function at recruitment. The allocation of patients to CMor dialysis was by shared decision-making in most studies. Most studies measured survival, & in comparative studies of CM& dialysis, choosing dialysis is associated with increased survival but in all studies where this could be identified the survival advantage was lost with increasing age & co-morbidity. Frailty was only defined & measured in one study & was more prevalent in CM patients, & frailty progressed as CKD progressed in both CM & dialysis groups. Quality of life (QoL) scores were measured in 4 studies showing reduced physical but similar mental components for CM patients compared to dialysis. Symptom burden was addressed in only 2 studies showing high levels in both groups but worse in CM patients. Neither QoL nor symptom burden scores were improved by chronic dialysis & indeed temporarily worsened at dialysis initiation. In one study, anxiety was higher in CM patients but depression comparable between CM & dialysis. Access to palliative care, death outside hospital & likelihood of invasive treatments were worse in dialysis patients. Conclusions: The data to support decision-making between dialysis or CMfor frail, elderly patients with advanced CKD is based on observational studies of variable quality. All studies are confounded by multiple issues including a lack of clear definition of CM & clear criteria for measurement of survival. However, all studies show reducing benefit in terms of longevity with increasing age & co-morbidity & reduced functional capacity. Offering CM to frail and/or elderly patients with advanced CKD is a viable alternative to dialysis which would not reduce longevity for many patients & would increase access to palliative care services at end of life. The evidence base for managing frail elderly patients with advanced CKD is poor. There is a need for an agreed definition of CM including its components & minimum standards. There is an overwhelming need for a robust assessment of outcomes including survival, QoL, symptom burden, treatment burden, nutritional & functional trajectory in elderly frail patients treated by dialysis or by CM.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Geriatric syndromes including functional impairment and frailty are increasingly prevalent as the mean age of the renal population increases. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients suffer more from functional decline with increasing age than the general population. Functional decline has been associated with adverse outcomes including mortality and hospitalisation. Physical function is multidimensional and the gold standard assessment tools are difficult to implement in clinical practice. There is thus a need for short screening tests that can routinely be used in clinical practice. This systematic review aimed to determine the best screening assessment method for functional status in frail or elderly patients with CKD. Methods: We searched for prospective and cross sectional studies indexed in EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and Cochrane, that evaluated physical function in older (age >65 years) or frail patients with CKD (eGFR >45 ml/min).We included studies that compared assessment tools to the standard (SF-36 Physical function subscale-SF36 PF). Results: From an initial 1080 references , 10 studies were included. Self reported tools on physical performance and physical activity assessed by Low Physical Activity Questionnaire (LoPAQ) correlated significantly with the SF36 PF score (Table).Lower Gait speed (0.6-0.8 m/s vs >1.0 m/s), an objective assessment of physical performance, was associated with lower SF36 PF scores by an estimate of -8.20 (-13.57 to -2.82). Objective measures on physical performance including Sit to Stand, 6 minute walk, Heel raise tests as well as self reported measures of physical performance showed good inter rater and test - retest reliability (Table). Conclusions: Short assessment tools that provide objective and subjective measures of physical function with good validity and reliability have been identified. These measures can be used in combination or in isolation in routine nephrology practice. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Dialysis patients are characterized by their advanced age , multiple comorbilities and higher mortality than expected in the general population. At the same time, the sensitivity in the Nephrology increases on earlier detection and establishment of palliative care, as integral care in improving quality of life and vital decisions-making. The “Surpise Question” -“Would you be surprised if this patient died in the next 12months?”- has been an useful tool in oncology and palliative-care fields. “Clinical Frailty Scale” ( CFS), developed by the Canadian society of Health and Aging, classifies patients based on disease activity and independence in their daily routines. (1: very fit; 2:well, 3: managing well, 4:vulnerable, 5: mildly frail, 6: moderately frail, 7: severely frail or terminally ill). Both of them have been useful, as well, in detecting patients with poor prognosis and susceptible of specific care. Methods: We have made a prospective study from January 2014 to January 2015. We have recruited 49 chronic patients in our HD unit. Being on dialysis treatment at least 3 months, has been one of inclusion criteria. Medical staff classifies patients in two groups (YES or NO in response to the “Surprise”). We have analyzed their status (alive / dead) in 12months' time. We have recruited demographic, CKD's etiologies, time on HD, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), self-rating scales (EUROCOL), Clinical Frailty scale (CFS), analytical and dialysis adequacy variables -as hemoglobine, albumin or Ktv. Results: 20 patients (40.8%) were classified into the “NO-group”. Compared with the 29 patients in “YES” group, “NO-group” was older (67.35 ± 60.72 /Vs /14.08±13.05), had a higher ICC (7.8 ±1.8 / Vs / 5.8 ±2.3) and lower values in self-assessment scale. At 12 months, the 18% of the patients died. The mortality in the “NO” group was 35%, whereas into the “YES-group” was just 6.89% . The risk of death in the “NO” group was 2.7 times higher than the “YES-group” The Clinical Frailty Scale(CFS) was useful as a predictor of mortality in the unit and multivariate analysis. In the adjusted Cox survival analysis, SQ loses statistical value in favor of CFS. The survival study shows lower mortality in the “YES-group” and in patients with lower fraility (those who had a rating <3). (Table a and b) Conclusions: The Surprise Question (SQ), and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) are effective in identifying patients with increased risk of mortality. When nephrologist respond to SQ they are considering frailty criteria above other analytical or dialysis adequacy variables. For this reason, we do believe that the SQ loses statistical value in favor of CFS (Figure presented).

N2  - Antihypertensive treatment is aimed at reducing as much as possible health outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. The main international guidelines and clinical trials showed different positions about blood pressure targets. At present, there is no common opinion about the benefits of an aggressive drug treatment; moreover it is not clear whether lower blood pressure values are related to increased morbidity and mortality. The recent randomized SPRINT trial has compared intensive vs standard drug therapy in a non-diabetic hypertensive population. The trial has shown benefits of intensive treatment in reducing important health outcomes, though results were not confirmed in several patient subsets. We examined the studies on hypertensive patients with comorbidities (i.e., chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) to identify blood pressure targets recommended in these populations, but no strong evidence was found about the benefits of intensive treatment. In geriatric patients the &quot;lower is better™ paradigm cannot be entirely applied because of comorbidity, polypharmacy and frailty.

Objectives: To observe the progression of elderly patients with ACKD (stages 4 and 5) and to compare the survival of stage 5 CKD patients with and without dialysis treatment. Material and methods: All patients ≥70 years who began ACKD follow-up from 01/01/2007 to 31/12/2008 were included, and their progression was observed until 31/12/2013. Demographic data, the Charlson comorbidity index, history of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) were assessed. Results: A total of 314 patients ≥70 years with stages 4 and 5 CKD were studied. Of these patients, 162 patients had stage 5 CKD at the beginning of follow-up or progressed to stage 5 during the study, and 69 of these patients were treated with dialysis. In the stage 5 group: median age was 77 years (74-81); 48% had IHD; 50% had DM, Charlson 7 (6-9). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis: ≥70 years (93 vs. 69 patients with dialysis, log rank: 15 P<.001); patients ≥75 years (74 vs. 46 patients with dialysis, log rank: 8.9 P=.003); patients ≥80 (40 vs. 15 patients with dialysis) and p=0,2. Patients receiving dialysis were younger, with a lower Charlson comorbidity index and shorter follow-up time. Conclusions: Our study shows that dialysis treatment improves survival, although this benefit is lost in patients ≥80 years.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Under recognition and deficiencies in the management of acute kidney injury (AKI) contribute to an increase in mortality in patients admitted to hospital. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the rate of AKI amongst patients over 65 years of age in the UK is on the increase. This is partly accounted for by the UK's aging population, but it is also a reflection of the enhanced diagnostic tools for AKI. However despite this, AKI amongst the over 65 years of age remains under recognised and poorly managed. AIMs: This is a prospective study of unselected acute medical admissions to a district general hospital. The study was designed to evaluate the relationship between frailty and AKI under recognition and adverse outcomes in the elderly. This was done through applying a validated frailty scoring tool to the study cohort and correlating this with AKI severity and outcome. Methods: Demographic data of acute medical admissions to a district general hospital were collected over a 6 months period. For the purpose of this study the data for 886 patients over 65 years of age were collated and analysed. Baseline serum creatinine, 48 hours serum creatinine, and peak serum creatinine were collected for each patient. Urine output measurements data were also collected for the first 72 hours post admission. Multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors for AKI and adverse outcomes. AKI was classified according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) AKI Classification. At admission, patients were given a frailty score using the validated Frail Non-Disabled questionnaire (FiND). A further analysis was undertaken to assess the correlation between the FiND frailty score and AKI severity, and the effect of this on mortality and length of hospital stay. Results: AKI incidence on admission was 20.9%. All-cause mortality was 4-fold higher amongst patients over 65 years of age in those presenting with AKI compared to without (P < 0.001). Increasing age, previous kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension and recent nephrotoxic medication use within 4 weeks of admission date were found to be independent risk factors for AKI. 42% of patients with AKI did not undergo repeat serum creatinine measurements as recommended. 87% did not have accurate urine output measurement documentation. The FiND frailty assessment tool scores positively correlated with worse AKI severity and a higher rate of adverse outcome. Conclusions: AKI in the elderly admitted to hospital remains under recognised and poorly managed. Frailty is an independent risk factor that adversely affected mortality and length of hospital stay in AKI patients over 65 years of age. This study highlighted the importance of early recognition of small rises in serum creatinine and monitoring this during hospitalisation. By incorporating the FiND frailty tool in the clinical assessment, we aim to improve AKI management in this age group in-line with current national guidelines.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Information on predicted outcomes including mortality helps older individuals select treatment options for end stage disease renal disease. A prognostic model incorporating the surprise question (SQ) “Would I be surprised if this patient died within the next 6 months?” and parameters including patient age, serum albumin, dementia and peripheral vascular disease( PVD) has been validated for patients undergoing hemodialysis for the prediction of 6 month survival. We conducted a prospective observational study in patients aged ≥75 years undergoing maintenance hemodialysis to test the association of mortality at 6 months of recruitment with the percentage chance of survival predicted by the model. Methods: Patients were recruited from 3 tertiary care hospitals and associated stand alone dialysis centres in Kerala, South India as part of a cross sectional study of frailty in older hemodialysis patients. SQ was answered by the principal investigator for all patients. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Instrument (MOCA) score ≤10 was used to define dementia. Patient records were reviewed to ascertain age, serum albumin and the presence of PVD as well as coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Predicted 6 month percentage chance of survival was generated using the model to categorise patients into 3, category 1- <60%, category 2- 60- 79% and category 3- >80%. Frailty was documented by scoring on a five domain (weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, weak grip and slow walking) tool. The number of deaths in the six months from recruitment was documented and causes were verified from records. Results: Of the 39 patients studied, 6 belonged to survival chance category 1 (15.4%), 11 to category 2 (28.2%) and the majority 22 (56.4%) to category 3. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), (a composite of CAD, PVD and CVA) was present in 19 (48.7%). 56.4% patients were documented frail, 12 (30.8%) were >80 years of age. There were 6 deaths (15.4%) by the end of study period. 3 patients withdrew from dialysis, 2 died of sepsis and 1 from sudden cardiac death. A significant association was found between mortality at 6 months and survival chance predicted by the model (p 0.023). Chi square test for trend showed a significant linear association (p 0.008). (Table 1). No association could be found for SQ alone (p 0.065), dementia (p 0.233) or CVD (p 0.946). Age >80 years (p 0.038) and frailty (p 0.019) were independently associated with mortality. Conclusions: Prediction of death on maintenance hemodialysis remains a difficult task in older individuals. Cardiovascular disease a well established risk factor for death on hemodialysis was not found to be significant in this study of survivors on dialysis. The use of the five term prognostic model incorporating SQ was found to be superior to SQ alone answered by a single investigator. A formal assessment of frailty can help in predicting death on hemodialysis in elders along with traditional parameters. (Table presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The kidney plays a major role in the metabolism and excretion of many drugs and their metabolites, and impaired kidney function is a major cause of adverse drug reactions. This is especially so in the elderly who have a high prevalence of kidney impairment often in association with dysfunction of other organ systems. Dose adjustment of drugs according to the level of kidney function is essential in such settings. There are diverse methods available for measuring and estimating kidney function. We examined the methods used, as stated in the product literature, for a number of commonly used drugs for which dose adjustment according to kidney function, has been recommended. Methods: We selected drugs for which dose adjustment in kidney failure has been recommended according to the Renal Drug Handbook. The product literature (Summary of Product Characteristics - SmPC) of all of the proprietary preparations of the selected drugs was consulted and information extracted relating to the measurement/estimation method upon which the recommendation was based. Drugs used in Oncology practice were excluded Results: Two hundred and thirty six drugs were identified, for which there were 738 proprietary preparations. The main classes of drugs were antimicrobial (31%), analgesics and anti-inflammatory (13%), those acting on nervous system (19%), those acting on cardiovascular system (17%), antidiabetic (4%) and others (16%). Kidney function parameters were referred to in the SmPC in terms of serum creatinine alone for 1.9% of preparations, and in creatinine clearance in units of ml/min in 42.5%, in units of ml/min/ 1.73m2 in 5.4%, and in other units in 1.4%. Others used glomerular filtration rate (ml/ min) in 4.9% and eGFR in 0.4% (as either ml/min or ml/min/1.73m2). In some cases advice concerning different preparations of the same drug was couched in terms of different renal parameters. Where renal function was referred to in terms of clearance, only 5.7% of the SmPCs referred to the method of measurement/estimation. This was the Cockcroft-Gault method in 5.4% and “an equation similar to Cockcroft-Gault” in the remainder. In the vast majority (94.6%) the method was not specified. Conclusions: There is great diversity in the ways in which renal function is expressed in product literature in relation to recommendations for drug dose adjustment. In the vast majority of cases the method of measurement/estimation is not specified. There is a risk of these parameters being used interchangeably, posing risks particularly in the frail elderly.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Various programs of physical exercise have been shown to improve outcomes in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Increasing age and comorbidity, however, are perceived to limit options for therapeutic exercise on HD. An individually structured physical exercise program (SPEP), broadly applicable also for frail and elderly patients, was introduced in five units of a large non-profit provider. We compared outcomes in SPEP patients with propensity-score (PS) matched controls. Methods: Patients ( pts) were offered a supervised SPEP consisting of 30 mins. each of strength- and endurance training twice weekly. Data were collected prospectively from the electronic health records through a quality registry. Controls were selected based on a PS including age, sex, vascular access, albumin and 16 other variables. Outcomes assessed were survival and hospitalization rate. Results: 98 pts participated in the SPEP and were matched with 490 controls (mean age: 68.6 yrs (IQR 58-78), mean vintage 56.4 mo (SD 55.0), 45.4% female, 51.4% diabetic, 33.7% with PVD). 17.9% were > 80 years old, 10.5% had a baseline albumin of < 35g/l, 45.7% had > 4 co-morbidities, 78.4% had permanent contra-indications to transplantation. After one year of training, important outcome-associated parameters improved in SPEP pts. but not in controls. Hemoglobin increased 1.3 % (0.15 g/dl, p = n.s.), and serum anorganic phosphate decreased 1.8 % (0.03 mmol/l, p = 0.04). Survival at one year was higher in SPEP-pts than in controls ( p=n.s.), and hospitalizations were lower ( p=0.03). Conclusions: These results confirmed that improving strength and endurance by exercise while dialyzing was not only associated with improved surrogate markers but decreased hospitalizations and, possibly, mortality. Individualized training was feasible also in elderly and frail HD patients. This will likely translate into improved patients' well-being, care perception, and fall prevention. This SPEP, therefore, should be considered as a non-pharmaceutical and patient-centered routine part of hemodialysis treatment.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Concerns on a possible negative impact of low-protein diets (LPD) on nutrition in CKD, mainly in frail patients, have been raised. We evaluated the short- and long-term effects of a LPD supplemented with ketoacids on nutritional status and body composition in diabetic CKD patients. Methods: In this case-controlled study were enrolled 197 consecutive patients with advanced CKD (stages 3/5) on a LPD (0.5-0.6 g proteins/kg iBW/day; 30-35 kcal/kg iBW/day; 100 mmol salt/day) supplemented with ketoacids (Ketosteril®, 1 tab/ 5-7 kg BW/day). Diabetics patients (DM, n=81; DM1, 6%; DM2, 94%) and non-diabetes controls (CON, n=116) were compared along either a short (6-months) or long (at least 24 months) period-time. Primary outcome was nutritional status. Results: DM and CON groups were comparable for gender (Male, 58 vs. 55%), age (66±9 vs. 63±18 yrs), renal function (eGFR, 22.7±13.0 vs. 24.0±13.0 mL/min/1.73 m2) and lab profile; body weight (BW) was slightly higher in DM (68.9±14.3 vs. 66.6±15.1, NS). In the 6-mo follow-up, in both groups it reduced urea (DM: 131±58 to 105±49 mg/dl, p<0.05; CON: 115±52 to 88±36, p<0.05) and cholesterol ( p<0.05); fasting glucose dropped in DM (122±54 to 103±29 mg/dl, p<0.05) without changes in insulin dose; albumin and triglycerides did not vary. BW lowered (DM: to 65.1±12.1 kg, p<0.05; CON: to 64.1±15.1, p<0.05); such BW decline entirely occurred in the first two months and thereafter remained stable; as attain body composition, it reduced total body water (TBW; -1 Lt, p<0.05) (no diuretic changes), fat mass (FM; -1 kg, p<0.05) and fat free mass (FFM; -1 kg, NS); fractional TBW, FM and FFM were unchanged; waist/hip (W/H) ratio was unchanged too. In the subjects (DM=29; CON=35) studied in the long-term (38±13 months), albumin was stable; BW reduced by similar extent of the short-term study (DM and CON, p<0.05) during the first months and remained stable in the long-term; absolute FM reduced ( p<0.05), and absolute FFM and fractional FM and FFM were unchanged. Muscle strength measured by dynamometry was near lower normal levels at baseline (DM, 20.8±7.9 kg; CON, 25.0±7.8) and did not changed at 6-mo and 38-mo observations. Conclusions: In diabetic patients with advanced CKD, compared with non-diabetic controls, a low-protein ketodiet while improving the metabolic status does not worsen nutritional status, body composition and muscle fitness in the short- and long-term follow-up.

N2  - Background: Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is done for long term enteral nutritional support. Procedure-related mortality has been reported to be about 0.5%; however, there is a reported 30-day all-cause mortality of 15-25%. Often, critically ill and frail patients are referred for PEG placement with no expected improvement in quality of life. Current guidelines recommend PEG placement when life expectancy is greater than 4 weeks, with consideration given to quality of life and prospects for recovery. Peri-operative mortality from PEG placement is not studied as a quality marker by major quality and outcomes databases such as () NSQIP. We aimed to study risk factors associated with 30 day mortality after PEG placement including ()MFI (Table 1), renal failure requiring dialysis and admission to the Critical Care unit. Methods: We retrospectively studied a cohort of patients who had a PEG placement at our hospital from May 2012 to June 2013. We excluded patients who had a prior PEG tube placement or if it had been placed for non-nutritional reasons. We collected data on demographics and factors included in the MFI. Our primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality. We correlated MFI with mortality using unpaired two tailed t-test. We performed univariate analysis of all perceived risk factors using both Fisher exact test and Student t-test; we then performed multivariate analysis on the significant variables. Odds ratios were calculated to estimate perceived risk. Results: Chart examination revealed 300 patients within the cited timeframe. After exclusion criteria, 224 patients were studied. 50 patients died within 30 days (22.32%). Patients who survived less than 30 were found to be older (p < 0.0005) and had a higher MFI (p = 0.0047). Univariate analysis (Table 2) showed worse outcomes were significantly associated with functional dependence (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.0 to 12, p = 0.044), impaired sensorium (OR= 2.6, 95% CI=1.1 to 5.8, p= 0.022), CHF (OR =2.3, 95% CI= 1.1 to 4.6, p = 0.0313), and HTN (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.0 to 8.9, p = 0.0383). Conclusions: Older patients and those with more than 5 MFI factors had significantly worse 30 day mortality after PEG placement. Univariate analysis revealed CHF, HTN, functional dependence and impaired sensorium are related to increased 30-day mortality. These factors should be considered in the pre-operative discussion with patients and family members prior to placement of PEG tubes. (Table presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Peritoneal dialysis is not available in many developing countries due to lack of expertise or fluid supply. It is challenging to start up new peritoneal dialysis programs where never was one before. One needs to assess all aspects, identify barriers and work on them one by one. The aim of this presentation is to provide a model and guide for new starters. Methods: While preparing to start a new peritoneal dialysis program in Nepal, we have evaluated all aspects of potential barriers. First the institutional and health care system barriers were addressed by training sufficient number of staff and facilitating government support for financing peritoneal dialysis fluid. Second, we had to work on the patient's side. Individual assessments were done by the nephrologist and the nursing staff on their barriers. Solutions were worked out as a team. Results: A successful peritoneal dialysis program has been started in the Western Region of Nepal in 2014. In the first one year 29 patients initiated peritoneal dialysis. Twelve nurses were trained and became experienced in peritoneal dialysis during this period. All patients were able to avail government support for funding. The individual barriers were as follows: 41.3% had initial lack of confidence in the modality, 51.7% required assistance due to age, frailty or other comorbidities, 31% had low socio-economic status with poor living conditions (mud house, lack of running water in homes), and 34.5% was living far from the center at not easily reachable geographical locations (Himalayas). Confidence in modality was achieved by giving time on discussing all fears and myths and clarifying truth and reality regarding renal replacement options. Patients, who already started peritoneal dialysis were also involved in this aspect. For patients who required assistance, family members were identified to become carers. In mud houses a plastic PVC carpet was placed in the room where peritoneal dialysis would be performed and that is the only modification that was necessary in these homes. For distant locations transportation of the fluid was arranged by 4-wheel drive cars where motorway was available and by horses to the hilly places without motorway. One year after the start of the peritoneal dialysis program, 26 patients were still continuing this modality (10% drop out rate). Catheter complications were minimal and easily managed. Peritonitis rate was 1 : 18 patient-months, while exit site infection was zero. Conclusions: Peritoneal dialysis is a viable option for renal replacement therapy in the developing world. It is possible to overcome barriers by addressing them individually. Good results can be achieved even in newly started peritoneal dialysis centers.

N2  - Background: Metastatic or locally advanced bladder cancer is a severe non-curable disease and patients may benefit from early and integrated palliative care. Localized bladder cancer is a curable disease but patients' comorbidities may limit their ability to receive and tolerate optimal care. We hypothesized that in this setting the goals of care may be difficult to determine and that inadequate aggressiveness exists. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of electronic records of all hospitalized adults ( ≥ 20 years) who died from bladder cancer between 2010 and 2013 in France. Individuals with co-occurring primary malignancies affecting other organs were excluded. Results: A total of 17,306 patients died from bladder cancer and were included. Among them 8,766 (50,1%) had a metastatic or locally advanced (i.e. with lymph nodes involvement) disease and 8,540 (49,9%) had a local disease. At least one comorbidity existed for 69.2% of patients with local disease compared to 53.2% of patients with advanced disease (p < 0.001). In the last month before death, 13,4% of patients with advanced cancer received chemotherapy, 6,9% artificial nutrition, 2,4% invasive ventilation, 2,6% dialysis, 4,0% hemodynamic support. 20,6% were admitted in ICU. Palliative care needs were first identified more than 30 days before death for 17,6% of patients with local disease and for 24,8% of patients with advanced disease (p < 0.001). 48,9% of patients with local disease and 26,6% of patients with advanced cancer died without any prior identification of their palliative care needs (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In the study, prognosis and palliative care needs are often underestimated in advanced bladder cancer patients resulting in important aggressiveness of care at the end of life. Furthermore, a high proportion of the patients died from localized bladder cancer and had a high burden of comorbidity. Our results suggest some individuals of this frail population may not be eligible for the standard of care of localized disease resulting in inadequate aggressiveness of care.

N2  - Background and objectives Frailty is common among patients on dialysis and increases vulnerability to dependency and death. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We examined the predictive ability of frailty on the basis of physical performance and self-reported function in participants of a US Renal Data System special study that enrolled a convenience sample of 771 prevalent patients on hemodialysis from 14 facilities in the Atlanta and northern California areas from 2009 to 2011. Performance-based frailty was assessed using direct measures of grip strength (weakness) and gait speed along with weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity; poor self– reported function was substituted for weakness and slow gait speed in the self–reported function–based definition. For both definitions, patients meeting three or more criteria were considered frail. Results The mean age of 762 patients included in analyses was 57.1±14.2 years old; 240 patients (31%) met the physical performance–based definition of frailty, and 396 (52%) met the self–reported function–based definition. There were 106 deaths during 1.7 (interquartile range, 1.4–2.4) years of follow-up. After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality for the performance-based definition (2.16; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.41 to 3.29) was slightly higher than that of the self–reported function–based definition (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.24 to 3.00). Patients who met the self-report–based definition but not the physical performance definition of frailty (n=192) were not at statistically significantly higher risk of mortality than those who were not frail by either definition (n=330; HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.81 to 2.45), but those who met both definitions of frailty (n=204) were at significantly higher risk (HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.51 to 4.01). Conclusions Frailty, defined using either direct tests of physical performance or self–reported physical function, was associated with higher mortality among patients receiving hemodialysis. Future studies are needed to determine the utility of assessing frailty in clinical practice.

N2  - Background: Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are frail and affected by multiple comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). The impact of renal dysfunction on TAVR outcomes and the effect of different anticoagulation regimens in patients with or without CKD are unclear. Methods: The Effect of Bivalirudin on Aortic Valve Intervention Outcomes (BRAVO) was an international, multicenter, study trial that randomized 802 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transfemoral TAVR to bivalirudin versus UH. We evaluated the impact of baseline CKD on TAVR outcomes, and the safety and efficacy of bivalirudin versus UH in patients with or without CKD. CKD was defined as a eGFR < 60 mL / min / 1.73m2. Major adverse cardiac event (MACE) was defined as the composite of death, myocardial infarction or stroke. Major bleeding (MB), defined as a BARC ≥ 3b bleed. Outcomes were reported at 48 hours. Results: Out of 802 patients included in the BRAVO trial, 438 (54.6%) had CKD. Patients with CKD were older and displayed a higher clinical risk profile. There were no differences in MACE or MB between patients with versus without CKD. However, patients with CKD had higher risk of major vascular complications (10.7% vs. 6.6%; relative risk [RR]: 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02 - 2.61; p = 0.04). CKD had no effect on the 48-hours risk of acute kidney injury. In patients with CKD, there were no significant differences between bivalirudin versus UH on the risk of MACE (3.1% vs. 5.6%; RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.23 - 1.40; p = 0.21) and of MB (6.7% vs. 8.8%; RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.40 - 1.46; p = 0.41). The effect of bivalirudin on the efficacy and safety endpoint was uniform between CKD status, without evidence of interaction. Conclusions: In the BRAVO trial, CKD at baseline was common and was not associated with increased risk of MACE or MB. The effect of bivalirudin on the efficacy and safety metrics was consistent between patients with or without CKD.

N2  - Background The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising and is likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future, with the fastest growth seen among adults ≥75 years of age. Elderly patients with advanced CKD are likely to have a higher burden of comorbidity and frailty, both of which may influence their disease outcome. For these patients, treatment decisions can be complex, with the current lack of robust prognostic tools hindering the shared decision-making process. The current study aims to assess the impact of comorbidity and frailty on the outcomes of patients referred for pre-dialysis education. Methods We performed a single-centre study of patients (n = 283) referred for pre-dialysis education between 2010 and 2012. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) were used to assess comorbid disease burden and frailty, respectively. Follow-up data were collected until February 2015. Results The CCI and CFS scores at the time of referral to the pre-dialysis service were independent predictors of mortality. Within the study follow-up period, 76% of patients with a high CFS score at the time of pre-dialysis education had died, with 63% of these patients not commencing dialysis before death. Conclusion A relatively simple frailty scale and comorbidity score could be used to predict survival and better inform the shared decision-making process for patients with advanced kidney disease.

N2  - Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of complexity, which is an essential condition for making the organism capable of keeping homeostasis. Thus, senile loss of complexity makes old individuals frail: a syndrome characterized by the presence of shrinking (sarcopenia), weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness, and low physical activity. Moreover, renal ageing progressively leads to a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction, one of the main pharmacokinetic senile changes, which is not detectable by simply evaluating serum urea or creatinine values but measuring or calculating patient's GFR. Finally, current epidemiology has documented that detrimental social-behavioral factors such as low education level, poor financial-resource, depression, and isolation, also influence the onset and progression of chronic diseases, and even overall mortality, particularly in the elderly. Thus, we propose that these 3 variables: frailty phenotype, senile GFR, and detrimental social-behavioral factors, should be considered at time of prescribing drugs or medical procedures in the elderly. Additionally, they should also be considered for following patient's response to prescribed therapies in elderly patients suffering from chronic diseases (diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, etc.), or on organ replacement treatments (dialysis and transplantation).

N2  - Purpose of review Frailty is the concept of accumulating physiologic declines that make people less able to deal with stressors, including surgery. Prehabilitation is intervention to enhance functional capacity before surgery. Frailty and prehabilitation among transplant populations and the role of wearable fitness tracking devices (WFTs) in delivering fitness-based interventions will be discussed. Recent findings Frailty is associated with increased complications, longer length of hospital stay and increased mortality after surgery. Frail kidney transplant patients have increased delayed graft function, mortality and early hospital readmission. Frail lung or liver transplant patients are more likely to delist or die on the waitlist. Prehabilitation can mitigate frailty and has resulted in decreased length of hospital stay and fewer postsurgical complications among a variety of surgical populations. Increasingly, WFTs are used to monitor patient activity and improve patient health. Interventions using WFTs have resulted in improved activity, weight loss and blood pressure. Summary Frailty is a measurable parameter that identifies patients at risk for worse health outcomes and can be mitigated through intervention. Prehabilitation to reduce frailty has been shown to improve postsurgical outcomes in a variety of populations. WFTs are being integrated in healthcare delivery for monitoring and changing health behavior with promising results.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in France. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and causes of death were analyzed. RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334 (23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72 years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis, 67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

N2  - Background: The majority of dialysis patients are elderly, and the trend towards even more elderly people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) will further determine the dialysis field in the future. Method: If these elderly ESRD patients do not opt for conservative ESRD care, they may still qualify for peritoneal dialysis (PD), which may be assisted or unassisted. Results: Although they may be more frail and have a greater co-morbidity burden compared to their younger counterparts, elderly patients with ESRD may still be able to maintain a good functionality level with adequate quality of life by performing PD, which may be assisted (treatment performed or supported e.g. by partner or nurse) or unassisted (without support). PD may indeed further contribute to maintaining autonomy, and enhance quality of life compared to in-center conventional hemodialysis. In order to illustrate this strategy, we hereby describe a centenarian patient with ESRD who received assisted PD successfully. Conclusions: With appropriate management and infrastructure, (very) high age is not a contra-indication for PD.

N2  - Receipt of pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) clinical care can improve outcomes for patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis (HD). This study addressed age-related variations in receipt of a composite of recommended care to include nephrologist and dietician care, and use of an arteriovenous fistula at first outpatient maintenance HD. Less than 2% of patients treated with maintenance HD received all three forms of pre-ESRD care, and 63.3% received none of the three elements of care. The mean number of pre-ESRD care elements received by the oldest group (80 years and older) did not differ from the youngest group (less than 55 years), but was less than the 55 to 66 and 67 to 79 years groups; adjusted ratios of 0.93 (0.92 to 0.94; p < 0.001) and 0.94 (0.92 to 0.95; p < 0.001), respectively. A major effort is needed to ensure comprehensive pre-ESRD care for all patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially for the youngest and oldest patient groups, who were less likely to receive recommended pre-ESRD care.

N2  - The primary aim of the NSW Heart Failure (HF) Snapshot was to obtain a representative cross-sectional view of patients with acute HF and their management in New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory hospitals Design and setting: A prospective audit of consecutive patients admitted to 24 participating hospitals in NSW and the ACT with a diagnosis of acute HF was conducted from 8 July 2013 to 8 August 2013. Results: A total of 811 participants were recruited (mean age, 77 13 years; 58% were men; 42% had a left ventricular ejection fraction 50%). The median Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 3, with is chaemic heart disease (56%), renal disease (55%), diabetes (38%) and chronic lung disease (32%) the most frequent comorbidities; 71% of patients were assessed as frail. Inter-current infection (22%), non-adherence to prescribed medication (5%) or to dietary or fluid restrictions (16%), and atrial fibrillation/flutter (15%) were the most commonly identified precipitants of HF. Initial treatment included intravenous diuretics (81%), oxygen therapy (87%), and bimodal positive airways pressure or continuous positive airways pressure ventilation (17%). During the index admission, 6% of patients died. The median length of stay in hospital was 6 days, but ranged between 3 and 12 days at different hospitals. Just over half the patients (59%) were referred to a multidisciplinary HF service. Discharge medications included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (59%), ß-blockers (66%) and loop diuretics (88%). Conclusions: Patients admitted to hospital with acute HF in NSW and the ACT were generally elderly and frail, with multiple comorbidities. Evidence-based therapies were underused, and there was substantial inter-hospital variation in the length of stay. We anticipate that the results of the HF Snapshot will inform the development of strategies for improving the uptake of evidence-based therapies, and hence outcomes, for HF patients.

N2  - The RRC Staff Assisted Home Hemodialysis Program started in September 2013 with the target of improving care for the frail elderly residents in skilled facilities by offering hemodialysis in their home setting. Residents all receive short time, frequent dialysis. The residents no longer need to be transported to a local dialysis center three times per week in all types of weather and subject to long waits by the transport company. In addition, Medicare/Medicaid save significant dollars on transportation expenses. Residents needing rehabilitation services can receive their therapy while their dialysis schedule is adjusted around the resident's therapy. Residents no longer miss meals and medications or family visits. Collaboration between RRC and the skilled facility is patient centric whereby the care of each patient is consistent and individualized. The most meaningful measure of the success of this program is the residents themselves. They have self-reported how much better they feel with more energy. The residents can increase their socialization activities within the skilled facility. The dietitians report that the residents are eating better because there are fewer restrictions on foods and fluids.

N2  - Objective The purpose of this study was to identify four non-cancer populations that might benefit from a palliative approach; and describe and compare the prevalence and patterns of dignity related distress across these diverse clinical populations. Design A prospective, multi-site approach was used. Setting Outpatient clinics, inpatient facilities or personal care homes, located in Winnipeg, Manitoba and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Participants Patients with advanced Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD); and the institutionalized alert frail elderly. Main Outcome Measure In addition to standardized measures of physical, psychological and spiritual aspects of patient experience, the Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI). Results Between February 2009 and December 2012, 404 participants were recruited (ALS, 101; COPD, 100; ESRD, 101; and frail elderly, 102). Depending on group designation, 35% to 58% died within one year of taking part in the study. While moderate to severe loss of sense of dignity did not differ significantly across the four study populations (4-11%), the number of PDI items reported as problematic was significantly different i.e. ALS 6.2 (5.2), COPD 5.6 (5.9), frail elderly 3.0 (4.4) and ESRD 2.3 (3.9) [p < .0001]. Each of the study populations also revealed unique and distinct patterns of physical, psychological and existential distress. Conclusion People with ALS, COPD, ESRD and the frail elderly face unique challenges as they move towards the end of life. Knowing the intricacies of distress and how they differ across these groups broadens our understanding of end-of-life experience within non-cancer populations and how best to meet their palliative care needs.

N2  - The number of patients with end-stage kidney disease 65 years and older is growing, and this growth is expected to continue. The presence of medical comorbidities, limited life expectancy, frailty, and poor functional status in these patients poses substantial challenges in clinical decision-making and provision of optimal care. Frailty is more common in elderly patients with CKD than without and is associated with poor outcomes. Several prognostic tools were developed to estimate the rate of CKD progression among elderly, and risk of mortality after dialysis initiation. Risk factors for CKD progression among elderly include low estimated glomerular filtration rate, high baseline proteinuria, acute kidney injury, low serum albumin, and presence of congestive heart failure. The decision to initiate dialysis in the elderly should take into consideration life expectancy, risks and benefits of each dialysis modality, quality of life, and patient and caregiver preferences. This article discusses common issues in the elderly with end-stage kidney disease, with particular emphasis on the impact of frailty and functional status, choice of dialysis modality and vascular access, and prognosis after dialysis initiation, to assist the nephrologist in making decisions regarding optimal care for this complex group of patients.

N2  - Background: Numerous frailty screening instruments are available, but their applicability for identifying frailty in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is unknown. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of three instruments used for frailty screening in an ESRD population. Methods: The study was conducted in 2013 in a teaching hospital in The Netherlands and included patients receiving haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis care. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of three screening instruments: the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), the Identification of Seniors at Risk-Hospitalized Patients (ISAR-HP) and the Veiligheidsmanagementsysteem (VMS), which is a safety management system for vulnerable elderly patients. The Frailty Index was the gold standard used. Results: The prevalence of frailty was 37% in a total of 95 participants with ESRD [mean age 65.2 years (SD 12.0), 57% male]. Frailty prevalence in participants ?65 years of age and <65 years of age was 44% and 28%, respectively (P = 0.11). Sensitivity and specificity for frailty of the GFI were 89% and 57%, respectively; ISAR-HP 83% and 77%, respectively; and VMS 77% and 67%, respectively. Conclusions: Although the GFI showed the highest sensitivity, it is not yet possible to propose a firm choice for one of these screening instruments or specific items due to the small scale of the study. Since there is a high prevalence of frailty in ESRD patients, translation and testing of the effectiveness of screening using the GFI in the prognostication and prevention of development or deterioration of frailty in this population should be the next step.

N2  - Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

N2  - Consequences of aging are gaining clinical relevance. In transplantation, aging and immunosenescence impact treatment and outcomes. The impact of aging, however, will critically depend on distinguishing healthy, chronological aging from biological aging that may result into frailty. Approximately 15% of individuals older than 65 years are frail, and it is expected that this condition will gain more clinical relevance with an expected increase to greater than 20% over the next 5 years. Clearly, frailty impacts various general aspects of health care and organ transplantation in particular including patient selection, waitlist management and treatment after transplantation. In general, frailty has been characterized by a compromised physiological reserve and an augmented vulnerability. In comparison to healthy aging, inflammatory markers and cytokines are increased in frail older adults. Thus, modifications of the immune response, in addition to physical limitations and changes of metabolism, are likely to impact outcomes after transplantation. Here, we provide a risk assessment of frailty at the time of transplant evaluation and review effects on outcomes and recovery after transplantation. Moreover, we summarize our current understanding of the pathophysiology of frailty and consequences on immune responses and metabolism.

N2  - Palliative care is a branch of medicine dedicated to the relief of symptoms experienced during the course of illness. Renal palliative medicine or kidney supportive care is an evolving branch of nephrology, which incorporates the principles of palliative care into the care of CKD and ESRD (dialysis, transplant, and conservatively managed) patients. Conservative (non-dialytic) management is a legitimate option for frail, elderly CKD patients in whom dialysis may not lead to an improvement in quality or duration of life. Patients with advanced CKD have a high symptom burden that often worsens before death. Palliative or supportive care by visiting nurses, palliative care programs, or knowledgeable CKD programs should be routine for conservatively managed CKD patients. Decision-making about dialysis or conservative management requires patients and families be given information on prognosis, quality of life on dialysis, and options for supportive care. Advance care planning is the process by which these issues can be explored. In addition to advance care planning, because patients with ESRD have a high symptom burden, this needs to be addressed. Patients with ESRD have a high symptom burden, which needs to be addressed in any treatment plan. Common symptoms include pain, fatigue, insomnia, pruritus, anorexia, and nausea. Symptoms appear to increase as the patient nears death, and this must be anticipated. Recommendations for management are discussed in the article. Hospice care should be offered to all patients who are expected to die within the next 6 months, and supportive care should be provided to all CKD patients managed conservatively or with dialysis.

N2  - Background. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a high symptom burden, among which fatigue is highly prevalent. Many fatigue-assessing instruments exist, but comparisons among instruments in this patient population have yet to be investigated. Methods. ESRD patients under chronic hemodialysis were prospectively enrolled and seven types of fatigue instruments were administered: Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Lee Fatigue Scale (LFS), Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and Short-Form 36-Vitality (SF36-V). Using these instruments, we investigated the correlation between fatigue severity and clinical/biochemical parameters, including demographic/comorbidity profile, dialysis-related complications, and frailty severity. We used regression analysis with serum albumin and frailty severity as the dependent variables to investigate the independent correlations. Results. A total of 46 ESRD patients were enrolled (average age of 67 ± 11.6 years), and 50% of them had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results from the seven tested instruments showed high correlation with each other. We found that the fatigue severity by FACIT-F was significantly associated with age (p = 0.03), serum albumin (p = 0.003) and creatinine (p = 0.02) levels, while SF36-V scores were also significantly associated with age (p = 0.02) and serum creatinine levels (p = 0.04). However, the fatigue severity measured by the FSS, FSI, FQ, BFI, and LFS did not exhibit these associations. Moreover, regression analysis showed that only FACIT-F scores were independently associated with serum albumin levels and frailty severity in ESRD patients. Conclusion. Among the seven fatigue-assessing instruments, only the FACIT-F yielded results that demonstrated significant and independent associations with important outcome-related features in ESRD patients.

N2  - Background and objectives Older patients reaching ESRD have a higher risk of adverse health outcomes. We aimed to determine the association of functional and cognitive impairment and frailty with adverse health outcomes in patients reaching ESRD. Understanding these associations could ultimately lead to prediction models to guide tailored treatment decisions or preventive interventions. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and COCHRANE for original studies published until February 8, 2016 reporting on the association of functional or cognitive impairment or frailty with adverse health outcome after follow-up in patients reaching ESRD either with or without RRT. Results Of 7451 identified citations, we included 30 articles that reported on 35 associations. Mean age was.60 years old in 73% of the studies, and geriatric conditions were highly prevalent. Twenty-four studies (80%) reported on functional impairment, seven (23%) reported on cognitive impairment, and four (13%) reported on frailty. Mortality was the main outcome measure in 29 studies (97%), and one study assessed functional status trajectory. In 34 of 35 (97%) associations reported, functional or cognitive impairment or frailty was significantly and independently associated with adverse health outcomes. The majority of studies (83%) were conducted in selected patient populations, mainly patients on incident dialysis. Conclusions Functional and cognitive impairment and frailty in patients reaching ESRDare highly prevalent and strongly and independently associated with adverse health outcomes, and theymay, therefore, be useful for risk stratification. More research into their prognostic value is needed.

N2  - Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss ofmuscle mass. As recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercisehesitant patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic stem (satellite) cells andmanipulation of transforming growth factor familymembers, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle mass loss and function in the future.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with worse health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in older adults and worse clinical outcomes in adults of all ages with end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is unclear whether frail adults of all ages with ESRD are more likely to experience worse HRQOL. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to identify factors associated with worsening HRQOL in this population. DESIGN, SETTING AND MEASUREMENTS: We studied 233 adults of all ages with ESRD enrolled (11/2009-11/2013) in a longitudinal cohort study. Frailty status was measured at enrollment and HRQOL was reported (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair or Poor) at the initial assessment and follow-up (median follow-up 9.4 months). We studied factors associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up using logistic regression and factors associated with HRQOL change using multinomial regression. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, BMI, diabetes status, history of a previous transplant, type of dialysis and time between assessments. RESULTS: Fair/Poor HRQOL was reported by 28% at initial assessment and 33% at follow-up. 47.2% of participants had stable HRQOL, 22.8% better HRQOL, and 30.0% worse HRQOL at follow-up (P<0.001). In adjusted models, only frailty was associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up (OR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.32-5.90) and worsening HRQOL at follow-up (RR: 2.91, 95%CI: 1.08-7.80). CONCLUSIONS: Frail adults of all ages with ESRD are more likely to experience fair/poor HRQOL and worsening HRQOL over time. Frailty represents a state of decreased physiologic reserve that impacts not only clinical outcomes but also the patient-centered outcome of HRQOL.

N2  - Data are presented from the third combined vascular and peritoneal dialysis access audit. In 2014, 53 centres in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (out of 62) returned data on first access from 4,339 incident haemodialysis (HD) patients and 1,090 incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Of the 5,429 incident patients, 20.1% started dialysis on PD, 27.8% started with an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), 1.0% with an arteriovenous graft (AVG), 27.1% on a tunnelled line (TL) and 24.0% on a non-tunnelled line (NTL). Older patients (565 years) were more likely to start haemodialysis using AVF compared to their younger counterparts (36.2% vs. 32.8%). Thirteen of the nineteen centres (68%) using the physician led percutaneous insertion technique had over 20% of their incident patients starting on PD when compared to only seven out of fourteen centres (50%) which used single technique (open surgical or laparoscopic) for their PD catheter insertion. Wide variations were apparent between centres for use of AVF as the first haemodialysis access ranging from 10-54%. Eight of the 49 centres were achieving close to the 65% target for AV fistula in their incident patients. Length of time known to nephrology services and likelihood of commencing dialysis using either an AVF or a PD catheter are strongly associated. Patients who were known to a nephrologist for over one year were more likely to start dialysis with AVF, as compared to those who were referred between 90-365 days (39.2% vs. 24.6%). Similarly, patients who were known to a nephrologist between 90 days and one year were more likely to start on PD when compared to patients who were referred ,90 days prior to dialysis start (26.9% vs. 9.1%). By comparison, amongst the late presenters, only 3.5% had first access documented as an AVF and 87.3% started dialysis on either a tunnelled line or a nontunnelled line. Initial surgical assessment was a key determinant of the likelihood of AVF formation. Of the incident patients known to renal services for longer than three months and in those assessed by a surgeon at least three months prior to starting dialysis, 71.4% started dialysis with an AVF whereas of those who were not seen by a surgeon only 10.8% did. Thirty one of the 38 centres were 2 or 3 standard deviations below the 85% target for prevalent haemodialysis patients with an AV fistula. For centres returning data on one-year peritoneal dialysis outcomes, the majority of centres (28/32) maintained 550% of patients on PD at one year, having censored for transplantation. This report demonstrates wide variations in practice between centres across several domains in the provision of dialysis access and further work will be required to understand the underlying reasons.

N2  - Backgrounds and Aim. Taiwan's population is gradually aging; however, there are no comparative data on emergency medical services (EMS) use between the elderly and nonelderly. Methods. We analyzed the emergency calls dealt with between January 1 and April 4, 2014, by EMS in one city in Taiwan. All calls were divided into two groups: elderly (≥65 years) and nonelderly (<65 years). Nontransport and transport calls were compared between the groups for demographic characteristics, transport time, reasons for calling EMS, vital signs, and emergency management. Results. There were 1,001 EMS calls: 226 nontransport and 775 transport calls. The elderly accounted for significantly (P < 0.05) fewer (28 (9.2%)) nontransport calls than did the nonelderly (136 (21.4%)). In the transport calls, 276 (35.6%) were the elderly. The elderly had a higher proportion of histories for cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, end-stage renal disease, cancer, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the elderly had significantly longer total transport time, more nontrauma reasons, and poorer consciousness levels and lower oxygen saturation and needed more respiratory management and more frequent resuscitation during transport than did the nonelderly. Conclusion. The elderly have more specific needs than do the nonelderly. Adapting EMS training, operations, and government policies to aging societies is mandatory and should begin now.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is defined as vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Its correlation with chronic diseases like CVD and CKD is well established. The prevalence of frailty in non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) CKD patients approaches 14-15% compared to 6-7% in general geriatric population. There is lack of literature on prevalence of frailty and its associations in NDD CKD patients in Indian subcontinent which is a potential group in which recognition of frailty may decrease the risk of adverse clinical outcomes. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the overall occurrence and difference in proportion of frailty between different groups of NDD CKD patients and the association between the number of deficits in health and eGFRcr and UACR. METHODS: This was a cross sectional study conducted on 90 NDD CKD Stage 1-4 patients aged 18-65 years receiving tertiary hospital care. They were divided into 3 groups of 30 participants each based on their eGFRcr calculated by CKD-EPI equation and micro-albuminuria assessed by spot UACR. A detailed case record form assessing personal profile; psycho-social profile; depression; clinical profile; Fried's frailty; MMSE; Barthel's ADL; WHO QOL and deficits in health was used. Frailty was assessed using modified Fried's frailty criteria by Wilhelm Leen and deficits in health was calculated using a list of 74 deficits based on the study by Searle et al. The occurrence of frailty and proportion of frailty in various CKD groups was calculated. The association of Fried's frailty withCKD groups; age; sex; BMI; marital status; financial status; family type; depression; MMSE; Barthel's ADL; WHO QOL and deficits in health was studied using appropriate statistical tests of significance. RESULTS: The study consisted of 51 females and 39 males and the mean age of participants was 49 years. The occurrence of Fried's frailty was 21.1% while 43.3% participants were pre-frail. The most common Fried's frailty components werelow physical activity; weakness and exhaustion. The proportion of Fried's frailty in CKD groups 1; 2 and 3 was 10%; 13.3% and 40% respectively and the association between Fried's frailty and CKD severity was statistically significant.The association of deficits in health with UACR; eGFRcr and CKD stages was not statistically significant. The mean deficit score was 8.5 and increased across advanced CKD severity groups. HTN and DM were the most common co-morbidities.A significant association of Fried's frailty with deficits in health; depression; Barthel's ADL and WHO QOL was seen. The association of Fried's frailty with age; sex; BMI; religion; marital status; financial status; MMSE; family type; DM; HTN and anemia was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was found to have a significant association with CKD and the proportion of frailty increased as the severity of CKD increased (p value=0.005). Frailty had a negative impact on life in CKD patients and correlated with worse scores in depression; quality of life and activities of daily living.

N2  - Advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is commonly affected by frailty, a biological syndrome of decreased body energy and protein reserves and decreased resistance to stressors. Criteria of frailty include unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, measured muscle weakness, slow walking speed and low physical activity, which are all prevalent in CKD. Preventing and/or treating frailty in dialysis patients has become a new challenge for nephrologists since the majority of dialysis patients are old and frail. Among possible treatments, nutritional interventions, exercise training, anabolic hormones, and vitamin D, have been proposed. The potential role of creatine, a nitrogenic compound, known to improve muscle accretion and strength in athletes, has not been investigated in this setting. Endogenous production of creatine, synthesized from aminoacids (Arg, Met, Gly) in the liver and kidney, and exogenous intake from red meat and seafood (about 0.5/100 g) are unlikely to provide sufficient stores of phospho-creatine in the skeletal muscle, known to produce rapid ATP release during intense muscle contraction. High amounts of creatine supplements, usually taken as creatine monohydrate, are necessary for this purpose. In geriatric medicine, small studies and meta-analysis have shown that creatine supplements (20 g/day 5 days followed by 5 g/day 12-16 weeks), with or without exercise training, may lead to increased lean tissue mass and muscle strength. Creatine supplements are easy to use because side effects such as muscle cramps, gastrointestinal symptoms, and elevation of liver enzymes are uncommon. Rare cases of renal toxicity presumably assigned to creatine have been reported, making creatine not recommended in CKD, as a safety principle. In anuric dialysis patients, the presumed concern of renal toxicity does not apply. This is why creatine supplements may be of interest in this setting to tackle frailty. Preliminary observations have shown that creatine supplementation induces increase of serum creatinine, since creatine is converted into creatinine. Side effects do not appear as a concern as well. Whether creatine supplementation in these patients may increase muscle strength and physical function is definitely worth to be studied.

N2  - A 79-year-old moderately frail man with a history of graft replacement for descending thoracic aortic aneurysm and chronic kidney disease presented with the onset of haemoptysis. Computed tomography demonstrated aorto-oesophageal fistula secondary to aortic arch aneurysm rupture. Emergency surgery was performed through a median sternotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established via femoral artery inflow and bicaval venous drainage. After establishing circulatory arrest, the aortic arch was excised. Resection of the aortic aneurysm and debridement were performed during antegrade cerebral perfusion and lower body perfusion from femoral artery inflow using balloon occlusion of the previous graft. Aortic arch graft replacement with concomitant debridement of mediastinal tissue and direct repair of oesophageal perforation comprised a first-stage operation. Forty hours later, abundant irrigation of warm normal saline around the mediastinal cavity and the omental flap covering the graft and the repair site of the oesophagus comprised the second-stage operation. Although the postoperative course was complicated, the patient resumed oral intake within 2 months after the initial operation. Serial computed tomography and oesophageal endoscopy showed good healing of the aorto-oesophageal fistula. There were no clinical manifestations or imaging findings of deep mediastinal infection throughout the postoperative course.

N2  - Background. Seasonal influenza is responsible for high annual morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in elderly patients. The aim of the study was to analyse the epidemiological, clinical and prognostic features of influenza in octogenarians and nonagenarians admitted to a general hospital, as well as risk factors associated with mortality. Methods. Retrospective, cross-sectional, descriptive study in patients admitted and diagnosed with influenza by molecular biology in the General University Hospital of Alicante from 1 January to 31 April 2015. Results. A total of 219 patients were diagnosed with influenza in the study period: 55 (25.1%) were ≤64 years-old; 77 (35.2%) were aged 65–79; 67 (30.6%) were aged 80–89 years; and 20 (9.1%) were aged ≥90 years. Most flu episodes were caused by influenza A (n=181, 82.6%). Patients aged 80 years or older had lower glomerular filtration rate (mean: 49.7 mL/min vs. 62.2 mL/ min; p=0.006), a greater need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation (22% vs 9.3%; p=0.02), greater co-morbidity due to cardiac insufficiency (40.5% vs. 16.4%; p<0.001) and chronic renal disease (32.9 vs. 20%, p=0.03), and greater mortality (19% vs. 2.9%; p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, mortality was higher in those aged 80 or over (adjusted odds ratio [ORa] 9.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65–51.1), those who had acquired the flu in a longterm care facility (ORa 11.9, 95% CI 1.06–134), and those with hyperlactataemia (ORa 1.89, 95% CI 1.20–3.00). Conclusions. Seasonal influenza is a serious problem leading to elevated mortality in octogenarian and nonagenarian patients admitted to a general hospital.

N2  - Background and objectives Patients of all ages undergoing hemodialysis (HD) have a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and worse cognitive function than healthy controls, and those with dementia are at high risk of death. Frailty has been associated with poor cognitive function in older adults without kidney disease. We hypothesized that frailty might also be associated with poor cognitive function in adults of all ages undergoing HD. Design, setting, participants, & measurements At HD initiation, 324 adults enrolled (November 2008 to July 2012) in a longitudinal cohort study (Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in ESRD) were classified into three groups (frail, intermediately frail, and nonfrail) based on the Fried frailty phenotype. Global cognitive function (3MS) and speed/attention (Trail Making Tests A and B [TMTA and TMTB, respectively]) were assessed at cohort entry and 1-year follow-up. Associations between frailty and cognitive function (at cohort entry and 1-year follow-up) were evaluated in adjusted (for sex, age, race, body mass index, education, depression and comorbidity at baseline) linear (3MS, TMTA) and Tobit (TMTB) regression models. Results At cohort entry, the mean age was 54.8 years (SD 13.3), 56.5% were men, and 72.8% were black. The prevalence of frailty and intermediate frailty were 34.0% and 37.7%, respectively. The mean 3MS was 89.8 (SD 7.6), TMTA was 55.4 (SD 29), and TMTB was 161 (SD 83). Frailty was independently associated with lower cognitive function at cohort entry for all three measures (3MS: –2.4 points; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -4.2 to –0.5; P=0.01; TMTA: 12.1 seconds; 95% CI, 4.7 to 19.4; P<0.001; and TMTB: 33.2 seconds; 95% CI, 9.9 to 56.4; P=0.01; all tests for trend, P<0.001) and with worse 3MS at 1-year follow-up (–2.8 points; 95% CI, –5.4 to –0.2; P=0.03). Conclusions In adult incident HD patients, frailty is associated with worse cognitive function, particularly global cognitive function (3MS).

N2  - Introduction: Inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) offer a new opportunity for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These agents reduce hyperglycemia by decreasing the renal glucose threshold and thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion. Subsequent reduction of glucotoxicity improves beta-cell sensitivity to glucose and tissue insulin sensitivity.Areas covered: This article analyzes the efficacy and safety data of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in randomized controlled trials of 24-104 weeks duration, compared with placebo or an active comparator, in patients treated with diet/exercise, metformin, dual oral therapy or insulin.Expert opinion: SGLT2 inhibitors significantly and consistently reduce glycated hemoglobin, with a minimal risk of hypoglycemia. The improvement of glucose control is similar or slightly better compared with metformin, sulfonylureas or sitagliptin, with the add-on value of significant reductions in body weight and blood pressure. However, caution is recommended in fragile elderly patients and patients with chronic kidney disease. An increased risk of genital mycotic infections is observed, but urinary tract infections are rare. Concern about an unexpected risk of euglycemic ketoacidosis has been recently reported. A possible renal protection deserves further attention. A remarkable reduction in cardiovascular mortality was reported in EMPA-REG OUTCOME with empagliflozin.

N2  - Background: The dialysis population is aging worldwide. It is well known that patients on dialysis have limited functional status, but only recently has frailty been considered. Summary: The prevalence of frailty among patients on dialysis ranges from 3.4-to 10-fold higher than among community-dwelling elderly, depending on the method of assessing frailty and patient characteristics. Despite its high prevalence and the high overall mortality in the dialysis population, frailty is associated with higher mortality, independent of clinical and demographic characteristics and comorbidity. The prevalence of frailty among patients with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also high, and cross-sectional data suggest that the prevalence may increase as CKD progresses. Thus, interventions to improve frailty have the potential to improve quality of life and mortality. Although interventions to improve physical dysfunction have been successful in the population with end-stage renal disease, no studies have specifically targeted frail individuals. Therefore, the extent to which exercise or physical activity interventions are feasible among frail patients and can improve frailty urgently needs to be examined. In the meantime, providers should refer frail patients to physical therapists and encourage them to be more active if possible. In addition, more attention should be focused on the possibility that rehabilitation among patients with earlier stages of CKD could improve dialysis outcomes. Key Messages: Frailty is extremely common among patients on dialysis and is independently associated with adverse outcomes. Providers should take advantage of available resources to improve functioning in this population, and research should address the optimal strategy for addressing frailty, including timing of intervention.

N2  - Background: The usage of nursing home (NH) services is a marker of frailty among older adults. Although the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) revised the Medical Evidence Report Form CMS-2728 in 2005 to include data collection on NH institutionalization, the validity of this item has not been reported. Methods: There were 27,913 patients ≥ 75 years of age with incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 2006, which constituted our analysis cohort. We determined the accuracy of the CMS-2728 using a matched cohort that included the CMS Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0, often employed as a "gold standard" metric for identifying patients receiving NH care. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the CMS-2728 NH item. Next, we compared characteristics and mortality risk by CMS-2728 and MDS NH status agreement. Results: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the CMS-2728 for NH status were 33%, 97%, 80% and 79%, respectively. Compared to those without the MDS or CMS-2728 NH indicator (No MDS/No 2728), multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for mortality associated with NH status were 1.55 (1.46-1.64) for MDS/2728, 1.48 (1.42-1.54) for MDS/No 2728, and 1.38 (1.25-1.52) for No MDS/2728. NH utilization was more strongly associated with mortality than other CMS-2728 items in the model. Conclusions: The CMS-2728 underestimated NH utilization among older adults with incident ESRD. The potential for misclassification may have important ramifications for assessing prognosis, developing advanced care plans and providing coordinated care.

N2  - AIM: Patients undergoing emergency surgery for paraesophageal hernia (PEH) repair have a higher adjusted mortality risk based on Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). We sought to examine this relationship in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), which adjusts for patient-level risk factors, including factors contributing to patient frailty.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of the NSQIP from 2009 through 2011. A modified frailty index was created based on previously validated methodology.
RESULTS: Of 3498 patients with PEH repair, 175 (5 %) underwent emergent surgery. Older age, lower BMI, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), current dialysis, SIRS, and sepsis were significantly more common among emergent patients. These patients also had a poorer functional status, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), and higher frailty scores and more likely to undergo open surgery. Postoperative complications were proportionally more common, and LOS was longer (8.5 vs. 3.4 days) among emergent patients (all p < 0.05). In univariate analysis, emergent patients demonstrated ten times greater mortality than the elective surgery group (8 vs. 0.8 %). On adjusted analysis, emergent surgery was no longer independently associated with mortality. Frailty score 2 or above and preoperative sepsis significantly predicted increased mortality while laparoscopic repair and BMI 25-50 and BMI ≥30 (vs. BMI <18.5) were significantly protective in the entire group of patients.
CONCLUSION: Increased mortality among patients undergoing emergent PEH repair may be related to severity of disease and other preoperative comorbid illness. Without an emergent indication, some of these patients likely would have been excluded as candidates for elective surgical intervention.

N2  - Background: The levels of many laboratory parameters are associated with the outcomes of dialysis patients, but the significance of their variability has not been well studied. Methods: A total of 384 patients receiving stable hemodialysis treatment during 2002 were followed up for mortality until the end of 2013. The within-patient coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for 13 laboratory parameters from 1 year of data. We defined variability as CV and analyzed the survival of the patients according to the baseline CV values of each parameter by proportional hazard modeling. Results: During the 11-year observation period, 125 patients died. Higher CV levels for eight parameters, namely, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, hemoglobin, creatinine, total protein, albumin, potassium and phosphate, were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The adjusted hazard ratios for a high BUN-CV (>15 %) and a high Na-CV (>1.3 %) against a lower CV were 1.92 (95 % CI 1.31–2.81) and 1.95 (1.36–2.80), respectively. The increased mortality risk associated with each variability was attributed to excess non-cardiac deaths. The CV values of most parameters were correlated with each other and often exhibited negative associations with age, diabetes, and mobility as well as the levels of hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, Na, the protein catabolic rate, and the creatinine generation rate. Therefore, a high variability was generally associated with frailty-related adverse prognostic factors. Conclusions: The variability of several blood parameters had a significant impact on all-cause and non-cardiac mortality. The levels of the variabilities were most likely related to poor physical conditions of the patients.

N2  - In the last decade, an increasing number of patients over 75 years of age are starting renal replacement therapy. Frailty is highly prevalent in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the context of the increased prevalence of some ESRD-associated conditions: protein–energy wasting, inflammation, anaemia, acidosis or hormonal disturbances. There are currently no hard data to support guidance on the optimal duration of dialysis for frail/elderly ESRD patients. The current debate is not about starting dialysis or managing conservatory frail ESRD patients, but whether a more intensive regimen once dialysis is initiated (for whatever reasons and circumstances) would improve patients’ outcome. The most important issue is that all studies performed with extended/alternative dialysis regimens do not specifically address this particular type of patients and therefore all the inferences are derived from the general ESRD population. Care planning should be responsive to end-of-life needs whatever the treatment modality. Care in this setting should focus on symptom control and quality of life rather than life extension. We conclude that, similar to the general dialysed population, extensive application of more intensive dialysis schedules is not based on solid evidence. However, after a thorough clinical evaluation, a limited period of a trial of intensive dialysis could be prescribed in more problematic patients.

N2  - Background: Frailty is associated with decreased waitlist survival and QoL in liver transplant candidates. Yet, it is unknown if pre-TRANSPLANT frailty is associated with post-transplant survival. In a large prospective study of liver transplant CANDIDATES, we studied the association of frailty and posttransplant OUTCOMES. Methods: 160 of 843 liver transplant candidates in the study have undergone liver transplantation at UMHS. Pre-transplant frailty was assessed using 5 Fried frailty score criteria: grip strength, gait speed, unintentional weight loss, physical activity, and self-reported exhaustion. Composite patient scores ranged from 0 to 5, with scores >2 considered frail. The relationship between frailty and survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, and multivariate Cox regression. Comorbidities and complications were examined using Fisher's exact tests. Results: The median frailty score in this cohort was 2, mean frailty was 2.4 (SD + 1.3), and 46.9% of patients were frail. Frail patients WERE more likely to have encephalopathy (47.5% v. 26.2%, p = 0.01), undergo reoperation due to bleeding (31% v. 7.8%, p = 0.001), develop renal failure requiring dialysis (27.6% v. 10.9%, p = 0.02), and suffer bacterial or fungal infection (58.6% v. 38.5%, p = 0.03; 20.7% v. 7.8%, p = 0.04). Survival was significantly lower for frail patients than for non-frail patients (74.7% v. 88.2%, p = 0.03, Figure). Frailty WAS associated with increased risk of post-transplant mortality in multivariate analysis (HR = 2.59, 95%CI: 1.12-5.99, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Frail patients have decreased survival following liver transplantation WHEN ADJUSTED FOR OTHER RECIPIENT CHARACTERISTICS and have a lower survival rate than national benchmarks (88% PER UNOS data). Identifying frail patients prior to transplant may improve recipient selection and enable the creation of prehabilitation programs to ameliorate frailty and improve outcomes.

N2  - Selecting peritoneal dialysis (PD) in older individuals is a complex, multi-step process. At each step, older individuals may not have the opportunity to receive PD unless care is optimized. Older individuals are less likely to complete a PD assessment, because of unstable medical conditions, consideration of palliative care, or reluctance to approach frail patients once they are established on hemodialysis (HD). Older individuals are also more likely to have medical or social conditions that contraindicate PD or to have barriers to self-care PD that may not be overcome with support. Older individuals who are eligible for PD may be reluctant to choose it, leaving HD as the default modality. Finally, receipt of PD may be compromised by urgent HD or PD catheter-related complications at the time of insertion. Despite all these challenges, older patients can do very well on PD, so each step should be well understood and optimized in renal programs to maximize PD use in older patients.

N2  - Background: The pathogenesis of falling is complex, and identification of risk factors may be essential for prevention. The relationship between renal disease and falls is unclear, and the goal of this study was to collect the available evidence and investigate the relationship between accidental falls and renal dysfunction. Methods: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid SP and Web of Science databases to identify the appropriate literature. The themes used were: falls (combined in the title/abstract fall or falls or falling or faller∗ or fallen or slip∗ or trip∗ or (MeSH) accidental falls) and renal insufficiency (chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases combined in title/abstract renal disease∗ or kidney disease∗ or renal insufficiency or kidney insufficiency or kidney failure or renal failure or MeSH renal insufficiency, chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases). The incidence, risk factors, complications, and characteristics of the falls were analyzed. Results: Eight prospective cohorts including five cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study were identified. No randomized controlled studies were found. The incidence of falls in chronic kidney disease patients ranged between 1.18 and 1.60 fall/patient year. These were frequent in frail older adults on hemodialysis treatment. Falling relapses in the same group of patients caused serious consequences. Data on pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) were scarce. Conclusions: The risk of falling appears to be common in patients with renal dysfunction especially in older adults undergoing hemodialysis. On the other hand, we could not find any conclusive data on pre-ESRD patients.

N2  - Background: Currently over 55% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are aged ≥60 years and patients >75 years represent the fastest growing segment of the dialysis population. We aimed to assess whether the Groningen frailty indicator (GFI) can be used to distinguish fit older ESRD patients, likely able to tolerate and benefit from dialysis, from frail older patients who need further evaluation with a geriatricians comprehensive assessment. Methods: All patients aged ≥65 years visiting the pre-dialysis unit at the Gelre hospital between 2007 and 2013 were included and underwent the GFI (n = 65). Patients with GFI ≥ 4 (frail) were referred for geriatric consultation (n = 13). Results of the GFI and nephrologists evaluation were compared with geriatricians assessment. Survival rates and outcomes after one year of follow up were recorded. Results: Twenty patients (32%) were identified as frail. Of the problems identified by the geriatrician in 13 patients, 55% were not reported in the nephrologists notes. The first year after inclusion, 30% of patients with a GFI ≥ 4 died, compared to 9% of fit patients (p = 0.04). Moreover, 90% of frail patients had been hospitalized one or more times, compared to 53% in the fit group (p = 0.005). Conclusion: Although the GFI can be a useful instrument to identify ESRD patients at risk, both the GFI and the nephrologists assessment failed to identify specific geriatric impairments. Further research is needed to develop a specific frailty indicator for ESRD patients and to determine the value and effect of a comprehensive geriatric assessment in ESRD patients.

N2  - Background: Evidence on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) is commonly derived from observational studies. However, these studies are prone to confounding by indication and healthy vaccinee bias. We aimed to systematically investigate these two forms of confounding/bias. Methods: Systematic review of observational studies reporting influenza VE and indicators for bias and confounding. We assessed risk of confounding by indication and healthy vaccinee bias for each study and calculated ratios of odds ratios (crude/adjusted) to quantify the effect of confounder adjustment. VE-estimates during and outside influenza seasons were compared to assess residual confounding by healthy vaccinee effects. Results: We identified 23 studies reporting on 11 outcomes. Of these, 19 (83 %) showed high risk of bias: Fourteen due to confounding by indication, two for healthy vaccinee bias, and three studies showed both forms of confounding/bias. Adjustment for confounders increased VE on average by 12 % (95 % CI: 7-17 %; all-cause mortality), 9 % (95 % CI: 4-14 %; all-cause hospitalization) and 7 % (95 % CI: 4-10 %; influenza-like illness). Despite adjustment, nine studies showed residual confounding as indicated by significant off-season VE-estimates. These were observed for five outcomes, but more frequently for all-cause mortality as compared to other outcomes (p = 0.03) and in studies which indicated healthy vaccinee bias at baseline (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Both confounding by indication and healthy vaccinee bias are likely to operate simultaneously in observational studies on influenza VE. Although adjustment can correct for confounding by indication to some extent, the resulting estimates are still prone to healthy vaccinee bias, at least as long as unspecific outcomes like all-cause mortality are used. Therefore, cohort studies using administrative data bases with unspecific outcomes should no longer be used to measure the effects of influenza vaccination.

N2  - Background: Although frailty has been linked to higher risk of falls and fracture in the general population, only few studies have examined the extent to which frailty is associated with these outcomes among patients with end-stage renal disease, who are at particularly high risk for these events. Methods: A total of 1,646 patients who were beginning maintenance hemodialysis in 297 dialysis units throughout the United States from September 2005 to June 2007 were enrolled in the Comprehensive Dialysis Study, and 1,053 Medicare beneficiaries were included in this study. Self-reported frailty was defined by the patients endorsing 2 or more of the following: poor physical functioning, exhaustion or low physical activity. Falls and fractures requiring medical attention were identified through Medicare claims data. We examined the association between frailty and the time to first fall or fracture using the Fine-Gray modification of Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for demographics, Quételet's body mass index, diabetes mellitus, heart failure and atherosclerosis. Results: Seventy-seven percent of patients were frail by self-report. The median length of follow-up was 2.5 (1.0-3.9) years. Crude rates of first medically urgent falls or fractures were 66 and 126 per 1,000 person-years in non-frail and self-reported frail participants, respectively. After accounting for demographic factors, comorbidities and the competing risk of death, self-reported frailty was associated with a higher risk of falls or fractures requiring medical attention (hazards ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.16-2.20). Conclusion: Participants reporting frailty experienced nearly twice the risk of medically urgent falls or fractures compared to those who did not report frailty.

N2  - The management of diabetes in older people is often challenging and poorly researched. The prevalence of cognitive impairment, chronic kidney disease and other co-existing comorbidities increase with age and have a significant impact on glycaemic control targets and treatment options. This conference examined current clinical practice, highlighted differences in the management of diabetes in the older person and suggested potential areas of future research.

N2  - Patients suffering from end-stage renal disease experience multiple disabilities, such as muscle wasting, weakness, higher postural sway, and fall rates compared with healthy population, which has a negative effect on physical functioning and autonomy. The vital treatment of hemodialysis is recognized to induce important post-hemodialysis fatigue, hypotension, cramps, and headache due to the rapid fluid redistribution, among others. Nevertheless, even the well-known negative effect of aforementioned consequences of hemodialysis treatment, its effect on physical function, especially postural balance, is unclear. Thus, this study hypothesized the adverse effect of hemodialysis treatment on postural sway in 12 end-stage renal disease patients (mean age 63.3±11 years) through the analysis of center-of-pressure (COP) trajectories recorded before and immediately after hemodialysis session. Evident postural alterations were observed at post-hemodialysis balance assessment for COP position-based (Fs<7.7, P<0.02) and COP velocity-based variables (Fs>2.33, P<0.05), without changes in complexity of COP time series in anteroposterior and mediolateral directions. These results suggest that period after hemodialysis treatment is particularly unsafe, as evidenced by important disability in postural control, and highlight the importance of the medical support and falls-related prevention strategies of these older frail patients after hemodialysis treatment.

N2  - Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a life-threatening renal infection caused by gas-producing bacteria and fungi. It usually occurs in patients with diabetes and patients with urinary tract obstruction. A combination of systemic antibiotics, percutaneous catheter drainage, or open nephrectomy is typically required to achieve cure. Because of grim prognosis, resorting to interventional methods is frequently inevitable. We report the case of a 77-year-old woman with diabetes and end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis that presented with fever and left flank pain. A bubbly gas pattern inside the left kidney was demonstrated on abdominal computed tomography scan and blood cultures grew Escherichia coli. She was successfully treated solely with systemic antibiotics. This highlights the fact that prompt recognition of imaging findings associated with benign prognosis is essential for a favorable outcome. It allows for an effective management avoiding high-risk interventions, especially in frail patients with multiple comorbidities. Finally, we review all published cases of EPN in chronic dialysis patients.

N2  - Objectives To understand the natural history of frailty after an aggressive surgical intervention, kidney transplantation (KT). Design Prospective cohort study (December 2008-March 2014). Setting Baltimore, Maryland. Participants Kidney transplantation recipients (N = 349). Measurements The Fried frailty score was measured at the time of KT and during routine clinical follow-up. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, factors associated with improvements in frailty score after KT were identified. Using a longitudinal analysis, predictors of frailty score changes after KT were identified using a multilevel mixed-effects Poisson model. Results At KT, 19.8% of recipients were frail; 1 month after KT, 33.3% were frail; at 2 months, 27.7% were frail; and at 3 months, 17.2% were frail. On average, frailty scores had worsened by 1 month (mean change 0.4, P <.001), returned to baseline by 2 months (mean change 0.2, P =.07), and improved by 3 months (mean change -0.3, P =.04) after KT. The only recipient or transplant factor associated with improvement in frailty score after KT was pre-KT frailty (hazard ratio = 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.71-3.82, P <.001). Pre-KT frailty status (relative risk (RR) = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.29-1.72, P <.001), recipient diabetes mellitus (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.08-1.46, P =.003), and delayed graft function (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04-1.43, P =.02) were independently associated with long-term changes in frailty score. Conclusion After KT, in adult recipients of all ages, frailty initially worsens but then improves by 3 months. Although KT recipients who were frail at KT had higher frailty scores over the long term, they were most likely to show improvements in their physiological reserve after KT, supporting the transplantation in these individuals and suggesting that pretransplant frailty is not an irreversible state of low physiological reserve.

N2  - Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction (sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42 % (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age, comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents. Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

N2  - Background: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength, body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were assessed. Methods: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12 months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us), endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition (DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed. Results: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6 %, of which 46 % were non-elderly. After some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95 % = 2.30 to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95 % = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; IC 95 % = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95 % = 1.00 to 14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 2.5 (CI 95 %, 1.04 to 6.50). Conclusions: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either worse endothelial function or mortality.

N2  - Stroke prevention in elderly atrial fibrillation patients remains a challenge. There is a high risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism but also a high risk of bleeding if anticoagulants are prescribed. The elderly have increased chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, polypharmacy, and overall frailty. For all these reasons, anticoagulant use is underutilized in the elderly. In this manuscript, the benefits of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in the elderly patient population with multiple comorbid conditions are reviewed.

N2  - AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD 0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) elderly patients have a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) due to the combination of ageing and chronic nephropathy damage. This situation is very important to be taken into account in order to prescribe an adequate medication and dialysis dose in this aged group. Besides, cognitive and urinary incontinence problems make difficult to obtain an adequate 24-h urine collection in order to evaluate creatinine clearance in this group. Thus, a reliable GFR estimating equation would be very useful for assisting elderly CKD patients. Additionally, Kt/V is the main parameter currently used for dosing dialysis in stage V CKD young and elderly patients. However, frailty and sarcopenia are prevalent disorders usually suffered by old people, who also present many physiological changes that could make GFR estimating equations and standard Kt/V value to become unreliable in this particular group. In conclusion, based on all these facts, it seems crucial for clinical geriatric nephrology to carefully evaluate how reliable current GFR estimating equations are, as well as which would be an adequate Kt/V value in CKD frail elderly patients.

N2  - Recommendations for the management of hypertension in the elderly are largely consistent with the exception of the 2013 Joint National Committee (JNC) 8 guidelines that recommend lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) in persons aged ≥60 years to <150 mmHg if they do not have diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. In contrast, I concur with the minority view from JNC 8 which recommends a SBP goal in these persons aged 60 to 79 years of <140 mmHg. This view is consistent with the 2011 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines that also recommend a SBP goal of 140 to 145 mmHg if tolerated in adults aged ≥80 years. ACC/AHA consensus guidelines use the totality of evidence in addition to randomized controlled trial data. These guidelines are also consistent with treatment recommendations from numerous other societies that recommend SBP goals of <140 mmHg in persons aged 60 to 79 years and <150 mmHg in persons aged ≥80 years. Hypertension is currently under-treated in the elderly, and relaxation of ACC/AHA guidelines by JNC 8 will result in substantially more cardiovascular events. Randomized clinical trial studies on treatment of essential hypertension or secondary hypertension in frail elderly persons have not been performed.

N2  - Hip fracture is a common occurrence in the elderly. Due to the growing demand for the specific care of these patients, we established the Orthogeriatric Unit (OGU) at San Gerardo University Hospital (Italy) in 2007. However, simultaneous bilateral femoral neck fractures among the geriatric population (those aged ≥65 years) are rarely reported in the literature. Reporting the rare case of a frail 76-year-old woman admitted with bilateral hip fracture and end-stage renal disease, we explain the important role played by the OGU and its flexible multidisciplinary approach for providing comprehensive care to patients with multimorbidity and clinical complexity. The team of geriatricians, orthopedic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and, in this case, a nephrologist, helped in the careful planning and timing of the single-step surgical repair, decided the appropriate type of anesthesia, and optimized outcomes. After a prompt evaluation of the patient, the OGU approach can achieve clinical stabilization prior to intervention. Along with a strict follow-up in the postoperative phase, this could result in a significant reduction of complications and mortality rates and an early start to a tailored rehabilitation process. We strongly suggest employing facilities with multidisciplinary teams for cases involving complex patients at short-term high risk for poor clinical outcomes. Indeed, the usual single-specialist model of care is gradually being abandoned worldwide.

N2  - The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) 2011 expert consensus document on hypertension in the elderly recommends that the blood pressure be reduced to less than 140/90 mmHg in adults aged 60–79 years and the systolic blood pressure to 140 to 145 mmHg if tolerated in adults aged 80 years and older. I strongly support these guidelines based on clinical trial data, especially from the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly trial and from the Hypertension in the Very Elderly trial (HYVET). Other guidelines supporting reducing the blood pressure to less than 140/90 mmHg in adults aged 60 to 79 years of age include the European Society of Hypertension (ESH)/European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2013 guidelines, the minority report from the 2013 Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) guidelines, the 2013 Canadian Hypertension Education Program guidelines, the 2011 UK guidelines, the 2014 American Society of Hypertension (ASH)/International Society of Hypertension (ISH) guidelines, and the 2015 AHA/ACC/ASH scientific statement on treatment of hypertension in patients with coronary artery disease. I support these guidelines. In adults aged 80 years and older, a blood pressure below 150/90 mm Hg has been recommended by these guidelines, with a target goal of less than 140/90 mmHg considered in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. I support these guidelines. The 2013 JNC 8 guidelines recommend reducing the blood pressure to less than 140/90 mmHg in adults aged 60 years and older with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease but to less than 150/90 mmHg in adults aged 60 years and older without diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. I strongly disagree with this recommendation and am very much concerned that the higher systolic blood pressure goal recommended by JNC 8 guidelines in adults aged 60 years and older without diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease will lead to an increase in cardiovascular events and mortality in these adults.

N2  - Background: The number of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease opting for conservative management rather than dialysis is unknown but likely to be growing as increasingly frail patients with advanced renal disease present to renal services. Conservative kidney management includes ongoing medical input and support from a multidisciplinary team. There is limited evidence concerning patient and carer experience of this choice. This study will explore quality of life, symptoms, cognition, frailty, performance decision making, costs and impact on carers in people with advanced chronic kidney disease managed without dialysis and is funded by the National Institute of Health Research in the UK. Methods: In this prospective, multicentre, longitudinal study, patients will be recruited in the UK, by renal research nurses, once they have made the decision not to embark on dialysis. Carers will be asked to 'opt-in' with consent from patients. The approach includes longitudinal quantitative surveys of quality of life, symptoms, decision making and costs for patients and quality of life and costs for carers, with questionnaires administered quarterly over 12 months. Additionally, the decision making process will be explored via qualitative interviews with renal physicians/clinical nurse specialists. Discussion: The study is designed to capture patient and carer profiles when conservative kidney management is implemented, and understand trajectories of care-receiving and care-giving with the aim of optimising palliative care for this population. It will explore the interactions that lead to clinical care decisions and the impact of these decisions on informal carers with the intention of improving clinical outcomes for patients and the experiences of care givers.

N2  - Despite the rapid growth in the number of dialysis patients ≥65, relatively few of these patients are receiving transplants. Dusseux et al. present a simple scoring system that helps to identify a group of such patients with a higher survival rate on dialysis. They suggest that such a screening tool might help to identify older patients for more comprehensive transplant assessment.

N2  - Nonexperimental studies of preventive interventions are often biased because of the healthy-user effect and, in frail populations, because of confounding by functional status. Bias is evident when estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness, even after adjustment for claims-based indicators of illness. We explored bias reduction methods while estimating vaccine effectiveness in a cohort of adult hemodialysis patients. Using the United States Renal Data System and linked data from a commercial dialysis provider, we estimated vaccine effectiveness using a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model of all-cause mortality before and during 3 influenza seasons in 2005/2006 through 2007/2008. To improve confounding control, we added frailty indicators to the model, measured time-varying confounders at different time intervals, and restricted the sample in multiple ways. Crude and baseline-adjusted marginal structural models remained strongly biased. Restricting to a healthier population removed some unmeasured confounding; however, this reduced the sample size, resulting in wide confidence intervals. We estimated an influenza vaccine effectiveness of 9% (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.15) when bias was minimized through cohort restriction. In this study, the healthy-user bias could not be controlled through statistical adjustment; however, sample restriction reduced much of the bias.

N2  - Introduction: A obese woman 89 years old (BW 90 kg) was admitted to our Unit for dyspnea and hypotension. Medical history: degenerative heart disease, moderate aortic stenosis, chronic kidney disease (stage III). Home therapy: diuretic and ASA. Physical Examination: Consciousness, dyspnoeic. Vital signs: BP 90/60 mmHg, respiratory frequency 26 breaths/min, heart rate 150 bpm, SO2 92% AA. Methods: ECG: ventricular tachyarrhythmia. ABG: pH 7.24, pCO2 43 mmHg, pO2 64 mmHg. CHEST x-Ray: Bilateral pleural effusion. Small circle hypertension. ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY: LAD 44 mm, FE 50%, SIV 12 mm, severe aortic stenosis, PAPs 55 mmHg. Results: We administred propafenone 2 mg/kg over 10 min IV (in hemodynamic non invasive monitoring) and we observed cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient underwent CPR and ACLS maneuvers. Atrial rhythm fibrillation (AF) with high ventricular response (150 bpm) was observed, The patient recived amiodarone 1 fl on bolus, 3 fl in 250 cc glucose IV infusion 5% (18 ml/h) and LMWH (6000 UI BID). After 24-h ECG: AF at 110 bpm, so we shifted with oral amiodarone and anticoagulation with warfarin. After 4 days, laboratory tests showed: INR out of range (>7) and Hb 8.6 g/dl, anemia was corrected with hemotrasfusions and oral anticoagulant therapy was interrupted. The 10th day on recovery the patient died for sudden death. Endoscopic procedures weren't so performed. Discussion. This case offers the opportunity to reflect on the choice (type and dose) of antiarrhythmic and oral anticoagulation therapy in elderly frail patients with comorbidity: enought is worst.

N2  - Little is known about the activity and tolerance of targeted therapies (TT) in patients receiving hemo- or peritoneal dialysis. Data regarding the efficacy and tolerability of sunitinib in patients with renal impairment are limited. The following report describes the case of a non-clear-cell histology that represents a rare subtype on which there is very little information on this setting. A 64-year-old man underwent left nephrectomy in March 2005 for papillary renal cell cancer (pRCC) pT3 G2 Nx M0. In August 2008, peritoneal dialysis was started because of renal failure due to evolution of pre-existing polycystic kidney syndrome and to previous renal surgery. In September 2009, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed mediastinal and lomboaortic lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent mediastinoscopy in October 2009 with diagnosis of lymph node metastases of papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therapy with sunitinib, 37.5 mg/day for 4 weeks for every 6 weeks, was, therefore, initiated in January 2011. During the first cycle, the patient experienced a grade 2 hypertension, whoch was well controlled with medical therapy. The second cycle started in February 2011 with an increased dose of sunitinib to 50 mg/die. The patient unfortunately experienced grade 2 fatigue and stomatitis and developed a subclinical hypothyroidism requiring thyroxine supplementation. Dose reduction to 37.5 mg/day was required on the third cycle and the patient had a good tolerance. CT scan performed in April 2011 revealed a stable disease and, therefore, the patient continued therapy. Fourth cycle started in May 2011 with a sunitinib dose of 37.5 mg/day but the patient suffered grade 2 fatigue and mucositis and lack of appetite. He had a progressive performance status deterioration and fever at the end of June. In July 2011, the patient was admitted to the Nephrology Unit with diagnosis of sepsis, quickly evolving in Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and leading the patient to death. The main concerns regarding treatment in patients requiring dialysis are toxicity and efficacy, primarily in the era of available targeted therapies. The efficacy of sunitinib in patients with impaired renal function seemed not to be inferior when compared to the response to treatment in patients with normal renal function. Unfortunately, it is a fact that this is a setting of frail patients that represent a challenge for the clinician.

N2  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea. Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression. Results: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower physical and mental quality of life. Conclusions: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of life.

N2  - Purpose of review Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here. Recent findings The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy supplementation combined with low-protein diet for the management of CKD may prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23mEq/l for nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven. Summary Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing comorbidities.

N2  - Introduction: Frailty among End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is associated with poor health outcomes, including delayed graft function and hospitalization following transplantation. Although frailty is prevalent among ESRD patients, little is known about change in patients' frailty status over time, including once waitlisted for transplantation. Methods: The ACTIVE/ADIPOSE study is a nationwide, multicenter, prospective cohort study measuring frailty among ESRD patients. The study collected components of the Fried Frailty Index (non-frail, pre-frail, or frail) and Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) among 742 in-center hemodialysis patients at baseline, 12-month and 24-month follow-up from 2009 to 2013. There were 283 patients lost to follow-up; 459 patients had complete follow-up data and were included in this study. Reasons for loss to follow-up were similar across the three frailty groupings, including death, transfer to another facility and modality changes. Patients' frailty status over the study period was compared to their baseline frailty status for the overall study population and waitlisted patients, respectively. Results: Among the 459 participants with complete follow-up, 54 (11.8%) were classified as frail and 270 (58.8%) were classified as pre-frail at baseline. Among patients classified as frail at baseline, 50.0% were classified as pre-frail and 3.7% were classified as non-frail at the 24- month follow-up visit (Fig1). Among patients classified as pre-frail at baseline, 17.8% were classified as frail and 20.7% were classified as non-frail at 24-months. Among non-frail patients at baseline, 43.7% were classified as pre-frail and 5.9% were classified as frail at 24-months. Similar results were found among waitlisted vs. non-waitlisted patients. Conclusion: In this study, change in the frailty status of in-center hemodialysis patients was observed over time. Further investigation is required to evaluate factors associated with these changes, and whether longitudinal measurements rather than single cross-sectional measures of frailty may be more informative indicators of pre- and post-transplant outcomes among ESRD patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Frailty is a distinct clinical syndrome beyond just being old and ultimately results in increased risk for disability, hospitalization, and death. Interestingly, it has been reported that frailty is more common and appears even in early stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and much younger population of this group compared to the general population. We investigated the prevalence, correlates of frailty and the association of frailty with hospitalization-free survival among clinically stable patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD). Methods: Between July 2012 and December 2012, we recruited study subjects according to the inclusion criteria as follows: (1) age of 20 years or older, (2) at least 6 months or longer on dialysis, (3) no hospitalization for the last 3 months, except for vascular access problem in case of MHD patients, (4) ambulatory patients with or without assistive device, (5) cognitive enough to answer the questionnaires without help from others, and (6) gave informed consent without proxy and finally followed 1,658 patients ( MHD =1,255 and CPD = 403) until August 2014. We adopted frailty phenotype composed of the following components; 1) unintentional weight loss more than 4.5 Kg or 5% of the previous body weight for the last 1 year, 2) physical inactivity, 3) RAND-36 physical function (PF) scale <75 and vitality scale <55 as surrogates for weakness/slowness and exhaustion, respectively. Low PF scale was scored as 2 points and other components as 1 point for each. Those with 0, 1-2 and 3 or more points were considered as non-frail, pre-frail and frail, respectively. Demographic data were obtained by review of medical records. Blood chemistry data used were the values averaged over the three consecutive routine checkup. Results: The 1,658 participants evaluated were 55.9 ±12.9 years of age (mean ± SD) on dialysis for 5.2±4.5 years; 55.7% were male and 39.4% were diabetes. Frail subjects were 577 (34.8 %) and 757 (45.7%) were pre-frail. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female sex, unemployed status, older age, higher body mass index, lower education level, lower TIBC and comorbid conditions were independently associated with frailty. During the 86 weeks follow-up period, 608 patients were hospitalized. The proportion with hospitalizations was 24.4% for non-frail, 33.0% for pre-frail and 48.4% for frail (P< 0.001). On univariate analysis, pre-frail and frail patients were as 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07 to 1.78) and 2.4 (95% CI 1.86 to 3.07) times as more likely to be hospitalized, respectively. Frail phenotype remained significantly associated with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 1.80; 95% CI 1.4 to 2.3) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Conclusions: Frailty phenotype was very common and significant predictor of hospitalization-free survival even in a relatively healthy patients receiving chronic dialysis. More studies are necessary for preventing or attenuating frailty in the chronic dialysis patients.

N2  - Aim Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on its impact on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these patients has not been attempted before. Methods A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural centre was recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered to these patients. Clinical and dialysis-related laboratory parameters were collected. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis complications were performed, and variables demonstrating significant correlations were entered into multivariate regression models to determine their independent associations. Results Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire showed significant association with each other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher Liu's comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and creatinine levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The other five questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis identified an independently negative association between serum albumin and the simple FRAIL scale results (P = 0.01). Conclusion This is the first study establishing the utility of different self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a closer relationship with dialysis-related complications. Summary at a Glance The simple FRAIL scale scores introduced in this manuscript might demonstrate a closer relationship with dialysis-related complications. This is the first study establishing the utility of different self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In patients undergoing hemodialysis, frailty prevalence is high and predicts mortality and hospitalization. Little is known about frailty in patients with ESRD who are being evaluated for kidney transplantation (KT) and whether frailty is associated with being listed for a KT. METHODS: 1,517 patients being evaluated for KT (excluding patients being evaluated for a live donor KT) were enrolled in a prospective cohort study (January 2009 and May 2014). The Fried frailty score was measured at the time of evaluation (nonfrail=score of 0 or 1; intermediately frail=score of 2; and frail=score ≥3). We tested whether frailty was associated with being listed for KT at JHH after accounting for factors that are known to be associated with listing (age, sex, race, body mass index, education and employment status) using modified Poisson Regression. RESULTS: At the time of evaluation, 34% were intermediately frail and 24% were frail. of patients being evaluated were listed for KT at JHH. Of those who were listed, 23% had received a KT. The median time between evaluation and listing was 3 months (IQR: 1-6 months; range). Frail patients 1.36-fold (95% CI: 1.15-1.61, P<0.001) more likely to not be listed after evaluation for KT even after accounting for other factors. There was no difference in the association between frailty and listing for older and younger adults (P for interaction=0.22). CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of frailty among patients being evaluated for KT and those who are frail are less likely to be listed for a KT. These findings suggest that although frailty is not being measured as part of routine clinical care, patients who are frail are less likely to have access to KT. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease admitted to dialysis are increasing dramatically and are at a greater risk for cardiovascular events. The importance of physical activity has been widely adressed, specifically regarding chronic conditions. The American Heart Association and American College of Sports Medicine published a set of recommendations applying to older adults and chronic conditions. The aim of this study was to assess if an exercise program would be feasible in a group of elderly, frail and diabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis and if their exercise capacity could be improved. Methods: All 45 diabetic patients from our Unit were given the possibility to exercise, irrespective of degree of functional impairment. Nineteen patients were recruited (6 men, 13 women). 15 patients (5 men), mean age 72±10 years, mean dialysis time 13 ±27 months, mean Charlson's Comorbidity Index of 4 (54 % patients), completed 16 weeks of supervised aerobic and resistance training, 3 times a week. Aerobic exercise training was performed with cycle-ergometers or treadmills for 20 minutes, before dialysis sessions. Resistance training was performed during the second hour of dialysis, using elastic resistance bands for legs and dumbells for arms, for 20 minutes, with the vascular access arm being exercised before dialysis. Results: Patients' showed enhanced results for all tests of physical performance compared with baseline. The STS-5 (Sit-to-stand-to sit 5) was 14,5±15,9 seconds at baseline (range: 10,7 - 74) and 11,1±4,9 seconds at 16weeks (range 7,7 - 24,7); STS-60 (Sit-to-sand-to-sit 60) was 22,0±6,3 times at baseline (Min 4; Max 26,3) and 24,3±6,5 at 16 weeks (range 12 - 38); 6MWT was 265±108,9meters at baseline (range: 115 - 439) and 315±133m at 16 weeks (range: 152 - 615). All values were of statistical significance with p<0,01. The mean value at baseline for 6MWT was 265meters, which is below the cut-off value for increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Conclusions: None of the patients experienced any accident or complications due to the exercise program. Exercise training is safe and efficacious even for elderly, frail, disabled and diabetic patients on hemodialysis. All physical performance tests showed increased values when compared with baseline. The STS-60, a surrogate measure of muscle endurance, increased by approximately 10%, The STS-5, a surrogate measure of muscle power, increased by 24% and 6MWT, a surrogate measure of endurance and power, increased by 18%.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The mortality rates of end-stage renal disease patients have significantly declined over the past decade. However, the mortality rates of dialysis-dependent patients with diabetes and chronic renal failure are frequently reported higher compared with those of dialysis patients without diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of diabetes in overall survival and technical survival in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods: We reviewed the medical records of all adult patients who received PD for more than 3 months between January 2005 and March 2013 in our institution. The total cohort was 117 patients (52.1 % males; mean age 53.50 ± 15.22 years and mean time in therapy 25.59 ± 17.87months). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 26.5%. Cox regression model for survival was used to predict mortality and technique failure. Results: There were 28 deaths and 33 technique failures. The two-year technique survival was 79.5%. There was not found diference in technical survival in diabetic vs non diabetic patients [HR=1.19 (0.54-2.64) p=0.67]. The number of peritonitis [HR= 2.44 (1.59-3.74) p<0.001]; high transporter type of membrane [HR=1.6 (0.5-5.09) p=0.061]; and late referral [HR= 2.33 (1.10-4.95) p=0.027] were independent predictors of technique failure after adjusted Cox regression model of survival for age, sex, diabetes, Davies index score and for referral. Presence of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001) independently predicted faster decline of residual function. The two-year patient survival was 82.1%. In univariate analysis diabetes was found a risk factor for lower survival 3.06 (1.43-6.56) p=0.004, but significance was lost in multivariate model adjusted for the same above variables [HR=1.94 (0.85-4.44) p=0.119]. Albumin level [HR= 3.72 (1.19-11.6) p= 0.024], SGA M+S [HR= 4.25 (1.71-10.6) p=0.002] and Davies index score [HR=8.39 (1.81-38.9) p=0.007] were independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions: Our study shows that Peritoneal dialysis is an effective long-term renal replacement therapy in diabetics, without higher rates of technique failure and lower survival. Peritoneal dialysis offers them the advantages of home therapy while sparing their frail vascular capital and preserving residual renal function. Cumulative center experience may achieve dialysis outcome improvements in diabetic patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Neck of femur fractures are associated with a high mortality in the elderly population. In the UK, approximately 70,000 to 75,000 hip fractures occur each year with an associated annual cost of around £2 billion. Many patients with a neck of femur fracture are frail and have complex medical problems, which can include end stage renal failure (ESRF). It has been shown previously that delay in operating on neck of femur fractures results in increased mortality. It is also recognized that delays to surgery can occur in dialysis patients. Lister Hospital, Stevenage is an average sized UK District General Hospital and is the central 'hub' for delivery of care to inpatients requiring haemodialysis for most of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. It has satellite outpatient haemodialysis units at St Albans City Hospital, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Bedford Hospital and the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow and also performs inpatient dialysis on patients referred from Queen Elizabeth II Hospital,Welwyn Garden City, Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, Bedford Hospital and Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow. The need for transfer of these patients from one facility to another has led to several cases of suboptimal care, anecdotally recorded by our department. Methods: Operating theatre and trauma co-ordinator admission records for the period January 2009 - January 2014 were retrospectively analysed to identify patients admitted to Lister Hospital, Stevenage with a fractured neck of femur, who were receiving dialysis. Medical notes for patients were subsequently obtained from the medical records department and were analysed. Results: 27 patients receiving dialysis were admitted with a fractured neck of femur over the 5-year study period. 67% patients (18) were male. The average patient age was 75.2 years (range 39-93). The average time from admission to operation for this cohort was 71.1 hours. 30-day mortality in dialysis patients operated on within 48 hours of admission was 20%. This was compared to 25% if the operation took place after more than 48 hours of admission. One-year mortality was 50% if the patient was operated on within 48 hours of admission and was 83% if operated on after more than 48 hours of admission. Conclusions: In this cohort, haemodialysis patients with fractured neck of femur experience significant delays in receiving an operation. Mortality rates in this cohort of haemodialysis patients with fractured neck of femur were greater than in the general population. Delays in operation and the significant pre-operative co-morbidity of receiving haemodialysis were contributing factors. Formulation of a specialised pathway for haemodialysis patients with fractured neck of femur at satellite haemodialysis units is required to help minimise delays in transferring patients to a hospital with both a fractured neck of femur repair service and in patient haemodialysis facilities. It is hoped that by minimising delays to operation, mortality can be improved.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Frailty is a condition in which the individual is vulnerable to develop increased dependency and/or mortality when exposed to a stressor. Sarcopenia is a major cause of frailty and its prevalence is high in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The association between sarcopenia and malnutrition prompted us to examine the relationship between frailty and nutritional markers in HD patients. Methods: We enrolled 80 patients with HD duration ≥ 1 year in the present study. We made a diagnosis of frailty based on FRAIL scale, which includes simple 5 physical components, and Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), which includes 15 physical, social, and psychological components. Results: The diagnosis of frailty was made in 18 patients (22.5%) by FRAIL scale and in 50 (62.5%) by TFI. FRAIL scale-based frailty was associated with higher age, female sex, and lower Barthel index. On the other hand, TFI based-frailty was associated with a lower serum albumin level and lower creatinine generation rate. The number of positive components of FRAIL scale and TFI positively correlated (FRAIL scale: r = 0.469, p < 0.001; TFI: r = 0.335, p = 0.002) with malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that when the cut-off value of MIS was set at 4.5, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting FRAIL scale-based frailty were 72.4% and 60.8%, respectively (AUC 0.699). If the cut-off value of MIS was set at 3.5, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting TFI-based frailty were 75.0% and 69.7%, respectively (AUC 0.817). Conclusions: Frailty was significantly associated with nutritional markers including MIS, although the proportion of the patients who were diagnosed with frailty markedly differed between the 2 sets of frailty criteria.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Frailty has been recognized as an important geriatric outcome predictor. However, few studies focus on its influence on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different self-report questionnaires for frailty assessment among these patients has not been attempted before. Methods: A prospectively enrolled rural chronic dialysis cohort was used for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered to these patients. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and clinical parameters/dialysis complications, including anemia, inflammation, and dyselectrolytemia were performed. Variables demonstrating significant correlations were further tested in multiple regression analyses to determine their associations. Results: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire were significantly associated with each other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated significantly with age (p = 0.02), female gender (p = 0.03), higher Liu's comorbidity index (p = 0.02), lower serum albumin (p = 0.03) and creatinine levels (p < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (p = 0.02) (figure). The other 5 questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis confirmed an independently negative association between serum albumin and the simple FRAIL scale scores (p = 0.01). Conclusions: This is the first study establishing the utility of different self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients. This simple FRAIL scale demonstrated a stronger relationship with important dialysis-related complications. (Figure presented).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) recipients have been found to have higher Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) than patients undergoing other forms of renal replacement therapy. It is unclear what happens to HRQOL between evaluation and KT and what factors (including novel factors like frailty) are associated with worsening HRQOL. METHODS: 233 patients being evaluated for KT were enrolled in a prospective cohort study (November 2009 and November 2013) and went on to receive a KT (through April 2014). HRQOL was reported as being Excellent (Score=0), Very Good (1), Good (2), Fair (3) or Poor (4) at the time of evaluation and transplantation. We identified patient characteristics (age, sex, race, donor type, time on dialysis, and frailty as defined by Fried) at the time of evaluation that were associated with worse HRQOL by the time of KT using ordered logistic regression (HRQOL score at KT) and linear regression (change in score). RESULTS: 29% at evaluation and 32% at KT reported Fair or Poor HRQOL. The median time between evaluation and KT was 9.6 months (IQR: 6-15 months; range: 2 weeks-3.5 years). Between evaluation and KT, 47.2% of recipients had stable HRQOL, 22.8% reported better HRQOL, and 30.0% reported worse HRQOL (P<0.001). Frailty at evaluation was associated with worse HRQOL at KT. In adjusted models, only frailty at the time of evaluation was associated with HRQOL at KT (intermediately frail OR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.15-3.49, P=0.015; frail OR: 2.97, 95% CI: 1.48-5.98, P=0.01) and worsening HRQOL at KT (intermediately frail OR: -0.05, 95% CI: -0.39-0.30, P=0.8; frail OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.05-0.86, P=0.026). Age, sex, race, donor type and time on dialysis were not associated with HRQOL at KT. CONCLUSIONS: Less than half of all KT recipients report stable HRQOL between evaluation and KT. Frail KT recipients are at highest risk of worse HRQOL at KT and worsening HRQOL between evaluation and KT. Frail patients being evaluated for KT should be identified as being at high risk which persists up to the time of KT. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Frailty is a biological syndrome characterized by a decrease in functionality. The prognostic role of frailty in heart failure has not been comprehensively studied in Latin American population. The evaluation of frailty might be important in HF patients because it can predispose to more adverse events. Objective: To describe the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty state using the FRAIL SCORE in a Colombian population of heart failure patientS. Results: The study included 233 elderly patients who were followed in a multidisciplinary heart failure program with a mean age of 76.4±6.97 years, 33,9% were male, the mean ejection fraction was 30.83%±12.97%. A high rate of comorbidities was found with and average of 4.4±1.75 per patient, the most common were hypertension (42,5%) Atrial fibrillation (27%) and chronic kidney disease (19,7%). 48,7% of the population had frailty criteria and 34,6% had pre-failty state. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of frailty in our population of heart failure patients that is explained by the increase of the life expectancy in Colombia and Latin America. The use of frailty scores must be implemented in the multidisciplinary heart failure programs as a screening tool to detect patients at risk of emergency department visits and hospitalizations.

N2  - Introduction and Aims:We aimed to examine the association between frailty and quality of life (QOL), nutritional status and clinical condition in elderly patients on hemodialysis (HD). Methods: Observational and cross-sectional study including 157 non institutionalized patients aged >60 years on HD for at least 3 months. The QOL was assessed by the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life questionnaire (KDQOL), nutritional status was assessed by the subjective global assessment (SGA), body fat (BF; by skinfold thicknesses) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM; by bioelectrical impedance). BF and SMM were divided by the square height in meters to calculate the BF index and SMM index. The clinical condition was assessed by urea Kt/V, albumin, 25 OH Vitamin D and C-reactive protein (CRP). Frailty was defined by a modification of the 5 frailty criteria from Fried et al: 1.Weight loss: Unintentional weight loss ≥2.5 kg in the past 6 months; 2. Slow walking: scored when answering “yes, limited a lot” for the question: “How much your health now limits you to walk one block?”; 3.Weakness: Handgrip strength (measured by hand dynamometer) in the lowest 20% percentile of our sample according to gender (≤20kg for men and ≤14kg for women); 4. Exhaustion: scored when answering “Some of the time”, “ a good bit of the time”, “most of the time” or “all of the time” for the question “How much of the time during the past 4 weeks did you feel worn out?”; 5. Low physical activity: defined from self-reported exercise habits. Three groups were created based on the number of positive frailty criteria: 3 to 5 domains: Frailty group (FrailG); 1 to 2 domains: Pre-frailty group (PreFG); No domain: Non-frailty group (Non-FG). Results: The prevalence of frailty, prefrail and non-frail was 31% (n=48), 62% (n=97) and 8% (n=12), respectively. The mean age was similar among the groups (FrailG=72 ±8; PreFG=70±7; Non-FG=73±8 years). The proportion of women was higher in the FrailG (FrailG=63%; PreFG=24%; Non-FG=25%, p<0.001). Regarding QOL, among the 22 domains of KDQOL, 18 were significant lower in the FrailG ( p<0.05). Regarding the nutritional status, protein energy wasting (assessed by SGA) was higher in the FrailG than in the PreFG and Non-FG (72%; 56% and 33%; P=0.03, respectively). A tendency toward higher BF index was observed in the FrailG (FrailG=9.3±3; PreFG= 7.9±3; Non-FG=7.7±3; p=0.07) and no difference was observed for the SMM index (FrailG=8.1±2; PreFG=8.7±2; Non-FG=9.1±2 kg/m2; P=0.11). Regarding the clinic condition, CRP was higher in the FrailG (0.37 (25th-75th, 0.2-1.2mg/dl) and PreFG 0.51 (25th-75th, 0.2-1.1mg/dl) than in the Non-FG (0.20 (25th-75th, 0.1-0.5mg/dl); P=0.04). Frailty score was negatively associated with SGA scores (r=-0.35; P<0.01); and SMM index (r=-0.3; P<0.01) and positively associated with BF index (r=0.20; P=0.02). In addition, frailty criteria was negatively associated with 19 from 22 KDQOL domains. Conclusions: In conclusion, in elderly on HD frailty was associated with worse QQL and nutritional status. The inflammatory status was worse in the Frail and Pre-frail groups.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Low pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP <130 mmHg) is associated with higher mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, target blood pressures (BP) in clinical guidelines have traditionally focused on avoiding excessively high rather than low SBP. This analysis examines international variation in HD facility SBP targets and the association with observed SBP <130 mmHg. Methods: DOPPS is an international prospective cohort study of adult HD patients. This analysis included 13,629 patients from 458 facilities in 14 countries in DOPPS phases 4-5 (2009-14). Facilities reporting pre-HD SBP targets in the DOPPS Medical Director Survey (58% of total 784 facilities) were included. Patient-level observed pre-HD SBP was calculated as the median of 2-3 measurements during a week from baseline cross-sectional data. Adjusted generalized estimating equation models were used to analyze associations between SBP target (lower and upper limits) and observed SBP <130 mmHg. Results: Median facility SBP target upper limits ranged from 120 to 180 mmHg and lower limits from 90 to 140 mmHg, with wide variation within each country (Figure). The percent of patients with SBP <130 mmHg ranged from 21% in China to 67% in Turkey. European countries generally had lower SBP targets and higher percent of patients with SBP <130 mmHg. In our models, facility SBP upper target was inversely associated with SBP <130 mmHg (12% lower odds per 10 mmHg higher target, p<0.001). Analysis of SBP target lower limit showed qualitatively similar findings (6% lower odds of SBP <130 mmHg per 10 mmHg higher target, p=0.09). A sensitivity analysis with the outcome SBP <120 mmHg yielded similar findings. Other characteristics associated with SBP <130 mmHg included older age, non-black race, greater vintage, non-diabetic, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease, and other cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: A high proportion of European dialysis patients have SBP <130 mmHg, despite associations with adverse outcomes. Both facility SBP targets and patients' observed SBP are generally lower in Europe than in North American and Asian DOPPS countries. Dialysis units' SBP targets are readily actionable. Facilities with low target SBP (e.g., upper limit 120-140 mmHg) should consider raising this target, in accordance with recent hypertension guidelines that have moved to somewhat higher blood pressure targets in the chronic kidney disease population. In particular, the 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) BP guideline cautions against excessive BP lowering especially in frail or older patients and those with CAD and low diastolic BP. Further study is needed to elucidate which HD subpopulations are particularly vulnerable to adverse outcomes linked to low SBP, and to assess the impact of differences in BP management practices on clinical outcomes.

N2  - Decisions and discussions about the initiation of dialysis in the elderly are often challenging because of the high prevalence of comorbidities and frailty in this population. Mortality is high, functional decline is likely, and quality of life tends to be lower in the elderly on dialysis. It is thus important to counsel these patients on the risks, benefits, and burdens of dialysis to assist them in making an informed choice that is in line with their goals, preferences, and expectations. For some patients, dialysis may be a desirable choice. For others, the alternative of palliative care may provide a more favorable balance of benefits versus burdens. Elderly patients who choose to proceed with dialysis often benefit from an interdisciplinary team that helps to manage and monitor their health status, while maximizing the benefits of treatment and decreasing its potential harms. These goals can be promoted by effective communication and through individualized decisions about vascular access, medication choices, and dietary limitations. Finally, close monitoring of functional status will help to determine whether dialysis remains in a patient's best interest and when alternatives should be offered.

N2  - The prevalence of low testosterone level is particularly high among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been associated with mortality. In populations without ESRD, low testosterone level has also been associated with a number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty. However, there is controversy regarding what constitutes low testosterone level in the aging population and at what level replacement therapy with testosterone is indicated. There are no randomized controlled trials investigating long-term outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in populations with or without ESRD. Available trial results suggest equivocal improvements in sexual function. Muscle mass and bone mineral density appear to improve, but results in physical function and performance are mixed and there are no data on fracture prevention. Some recent data suggest harm when testosterone was given to men with limited mobility. Finally, there is little evidence that testosterone adds to existing erythropoietin agents in the treatment of anemia in ESRD. Due to lack of evidence supporting long-term use of testosterone, the authors recommend against the routine use of testosterone in ESRD patients with low testosterone levels. Testosterone treatment can be considered in those with low bone mass and total testosterone level <200 ng/dl, or in younger patients with sexual complaints with total testosterone level lower than the reference range. It is important to engage patients in discussion of risks and benefits before initiating testosterone therapy; testosterone therapy should be discontinued if the intended treatment effect is not observed after short-term use.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Background/Aim: Increasing age and comorbidity of patients are perceived to limit options for therapeutic exercise on hemodialysis (HD). An individually structured physical exercise program (SPEP) for patients on HD was introduced in five units of a large non-profit provider. It is broadly applicable also for frail and elderly patients. The aim of this analysis was to compare parameters of dialysis efficacy before and after one year of training. Methods: Patients and Methods: Patients ( pts) were offered a supervised SPEP consisting of 30 mins. each of strength- and endurance training twice weekly. Clinical and laboratory data as well as medication use in the 3 months before start of the SPEP were compared with results one year later. Data were collected prospectively from the electronic health records through a quality registry. Results: 115 pts participated in the SPEP (mean age: 66.4 yrs (IQR 60.5 -77.0).; 43.5% female, 60% diabetic, mean vintage 36.1 mo (±49.6), 52% with ≥ 4 comorbidities, 20.9% with catheter). After one year of training, important outcome-associated parameters improved: Albumin increased 2.8% (1.1 g/dl; p=0.01), Kt/V increased 7.5% (by 1.1 p=n.s.). Serum anorganic phosphate and the use of phosphate binders decreased 3.4% (0.05 mmol/l; p=n.s.) and 15.9%, from 4.1 to 3.45 tablets/day ( p=n.s.), respectively.Weekly EPO doses corrected for hemoglobin (wEPO/Hb) fell 10.4% (42.7 IE/g/dl; p=n.s.). Conclusions: These results show that an individually structured exercise program like this SPEP can be applied successfully in elderly and frail HD patients. Substantial improvements can be achieved, which will likely translate into improved outcomes, including patients' well-being and care perception, fall prevention and mortality. This SPEP, therefore, can be used as a non-pharmaceutical and patient-centered routine part of hemodialysis treatment.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: PD-patients are ten year younger than those on HD in Spain; however there is a subgroup of patients over 70 y. that choose PD. Our aim is to describe characteristic and clinical outcomes of elderly PD patients. Methods: Multicentre (19) historic prospective study over PD incident patients (2003-2011). Cohort: 1.312 patients with a mean follow-up of 2.1 year, 19,5% out of them over 70 years (aged 75.4 vs 49 y). Results: We compared Elderly patients (EP) with controls under 70 years (YP) (EP vs YP; p value) and EP present higher comorbidity: Charlson Index (without age): 3.8 (SD 1.6) vs 3.2 (SD 1.7) p<0.05), % of patient with a previous CV event (46.1 vs 21,2%; p<0.05) or % diabetes mellitus (32.8 vs 21.5% p<0.05). The EP patients also came more frequently from CKD consults (83 vs 71.6%) than from HD (16.2 vs 18.6%) or failed transplantation (0.8% vs 9.9%, p<0.01). EP presented similar initial eGFR, started more frequently with manual CAPD (77.4 vs 65.8%; p<0.05) and they got similar targets for eficacy and anemia at the 1st PD visit. (% with optimal Kt/V and nCrC: 79.5 vs 75.6% and % Hb<11 16.5 vs 21.7% ns). EP presented higher peritonitis rate (0.77 vs 0.49 per patient-year; p<0.05); hospital admission rate (0.68 vs 0.60 ppyr; p<0.05) and mortality (0.158 vs 0.054 ppy). The K-M estimated time to death was lower 3.9 [2.4-5.4] vs 6.4 [5.5-7.3] year. Main cause of death was infectious in both groups but voluntarily withdrawal of PD was higher on EP (7.5 vs 1.8%). PD-Technique failure due to patient or partner burn-out was higher for EP group (EP vs YP: 23.7 vs 14.5%) that those due to technical problems like low efficacy, ultrafiltration or abdominal/catheter problems (16.8 vs 32.9% ,p<0.05). Only 14.8% of EP patients (vs 68.15 on YP) were included on transplant (Tx) waiting list, but time-to-Tx were similar in both groups for those who receive it, and yearly transplant rates were also similar in both groups: (21,5 vs 22.5% at 1st y and 42.7 vs 48.6% at 2nd y) They spent similar time on PD but EP leave PD more frequently by death (31.6 vs 10.8; p<0.001) or PD-failure (30.4 vs 17.7; p<0.001) than by Tx (44.9 vs 7.5; p<0.001). Conclusions: Elderly patients present a worse general outcome than controls and they need special attention for frailty and more social support, however they spent enough time on PD to consider offer this technique to those that ask for it.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Abnormal bone architecture contributes to high incidence of hip fractures in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients. Their clinical epidemiology is incompletely described.We conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the implications of hospitalization with hip fracture in HD patients compared to the non-CKD population. Methods: Thirty three chronic HD patients admitted with hip fracture over 5 years were age- and sex-matched on a 1:1 ratio with controls that had hip fracture and normal renal function. Demographic characteristics, deaths and readmissions at 6 months, hospitalization length, time to operation and laboratory results were recorded from electronic health files. Data were compared between the two groups using paired t-test for continuous variables and McNemar's test for categorical variables. Results: The composite end-point of death and/or readmission at 6 months was higher in HD patients (12.1% versus 6.2%, p<0.001). Furthermore, mean time to operation was more delayed due to comorbidities (4.7 versus 2.9 days, p=0.04). HD patients had more frequently anemia at presentation (hemoglobin below 10 mg/dl, 32.1% versus 12.5%, p=0.003). Finally, they were more likely to be considered too frail for surgery and were not operated (21.2% versus 6.2%, p<0.001). Conclusions: Hip fractures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality and represent an important healthcare burden for chronic HD patients. Future research is needed to identify definite predictors of adverse outcomes and to implement prevention strategies.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the general population and adults with chronic diseases, however prognostic data for periodontitis in the setting of kidney failure are sparse. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether periodontitis was prognostic for all-cause and cardiovascular-related death in adults with kidney failure. Methods: ORALD is a multinational cohort study in adults with kidney failure treated with haemodialysis in Europe (France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Spain) and Argentina. Periodontitis was measured at baseline according to theWorld Health Organization Community Periodontal Index. The outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Analyses were conducted using a fixed-effect Cox proportional hazards analysis and additionally using a random effects model fitted using shared frailty to account for clustering within countries. Results: Periodontitis was evaluable in 3338 dentate participants of which 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe periodontitis. During 6150 person-years of follow-up, 650 deaths occurred of which 325 were cardiovascular. In multivariable analyses, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a lower hazard of all-cause (HR 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (0.69, 0.54 to 0.87) mortality. There was evidence of decreasing mortality risks with more severe periodontal disease (P≤0.001 for trend). However, when analyses accounted for clustering of participants within countries, the associations between periodontitis and all-cause (0.92, 0.75 to 1.11) and cardiovascular (0.83, 0.63 to 1.09) mortality were not significant. Similar results were observed in analyses restricted to participants with 12 or more teeth and when competing risks for cardiovascular death were considered. Conclusions: Unlike in the general population, there is limited evidence that periodontitis is independently associated with increased all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in adults with kidney failure.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Metformin (MF) accumulation during acute kidney injury results in high anion gap lactic acidosis type B (MF Associated Lactic Acidosis, MALA), a serious medical condition with high mortality. Current treatment guidelines recommends strict biochemical parameters monitoring and adherence to dose adjustment in CKD. However, notably in aged patients with important cardiovascular comorbidities, GFR can fluctuate greatly for dehydration leading to drug's accumulation and, lastly, to lactic acidosis. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 16 consecutive patients admitted to our Hospital's Emergency Department with clinical findings consistent with the diagnosis of MALA. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients recorded with MALA from a single Centre over a 5-year period was performed. Inclusion criteria: history of type 2 DM in MF treatment, blood pH <7.3, serum bicarbonate (sHCO3-) < 22 mEq/l, serum lactate (sLac) >5 mmol/l. Exclusion criteria: self-administered overdose, lactic acidosis type A, diabetic ketoacidosis, tumor lysis syndrome, history of severe hepatic, respiratory and cardiac insufficiency. Study variables: demographic-anamnestic data, analytical study, biological parameters and illness severity score (SAPS II- Simplified Acute Physiology Score II- and SOFA score- Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score with relative probability of death) at admission, therapies and outcomes. Results: Sixteen patients were admitted to the Emergency Department with diagnosis of MALA and prerenal AKI. Fifteen had prior history of CKD, 60% of them were in stage 3 or 4. In this cases acidosis was more severe: (average pH <7, sHCO3- <10 mEq/l and sLac >10 mmol/l). Five patients required mechanical ventilation and cardiovascular support; 3 subjects promptly recovered renal function after rehydration, whereas 13 required renal replacement therapy (continuous veno-venous technique for 77% of them). The degree of lactic acidosis was significantly related to SOFA and SAPS II scores ( p<0.01). In addition, sLac was important for therapeutic choices: its concentration was significantly higher in dialyzed patients than in those in conservative treatment (sLac 11.92 mmol/l versus 5.7 mmol/l, p< 0.03). The overall death rate has been 31%. The decrease in pH was significantly greater in non survivors (pH 6.96 versus 7.16, p<0.04). Conclusions: Our data would underline that aged, hemodynamically frail patients, with several comorbidities and CKD are at greater risk of MALA, despite dosage adjustment. As a consequence a more careful approach, particularly among patients in CKD stage III- IV with condition predisposing to AKI, should be suggested.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Frailty, a validated measure of physiologic reserve, predicts adverse health outcomes among adults with end-stage renal disease. Frailty typically is not measured clinically; instead, a surrogate-perceived frailty-is used to inform clinical decision-making. Because correlations between perceived and measured frailty remain unknown, the aim of this study was to assess their relationship.
METHODS: 146 adults undergoing hemodialysis were recruited from a single dialysis center in Baltimore, Maryland. Patient characteristics associated with perceived (reported by nephrologists, nurse practitioners (NPs), or patients) or measured frailty (using the Fried criteria) were identified using ordered logistic regression. The relationship between perceived and measured frailty was assessed using percent agreement, kappa statistic, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and prevalence of misclassification of frailty. Patient characteristics associated with misclassification were determined using Fisher's exact tests, t-tests, or median tests.
RESULTS: Older age (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.36, 95%CI:1.11-1.68, P = 0.003 per 5-years older) and comorbidity (aOR = 1.49, 95%CI:1.27-1.75, P < 0.001 per additional comorbidity) were associated with greater likelihood of nephrologist-perceived frailty. Being non-African American was associated with greater likelihood of NP- (aOR = 5.51, 95%CI:3.21-9.48, P = 0.003) and patient- (aOR = 4.20, 95%CI:1.61-10.9, P = 0.003) perceived frailty. Percent agreement between perceived and measured frailty was poor (nephrologist, NP, and patient: 64.1%, 67.0%, and 55.5%). Among non-frail participants, 34.4%, 30.0%, and 31.6% were perceived as frail by a nephrologist, NP, or themselves. Older adults (P < 0.001) were more likely to be misclassified as frail by a nephrologist; women (P = 0.04) and non-African Americans (P = 0.02) were more likely to be misclassified by an NP. Neither age, sex, nor race was associated with patient misclassification.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceived frailty is an inadequate proxy for measured frailty among patients undergoing hemodialysis.

N2  - Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose reduction or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead to rejection and possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known about what factors might cause or contribute toMDR. Frailty, ameasure of physiologic reserve, is emerging as an important, novel domain of risk in kidney transplantation recipients. We hypothesized that frailty, an inflammatory phenotype, might be associated with MDR. Methods. We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor characteristics, longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 kidney transplantation recipients. Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. Results. By 2 years after transplantation, 54% of frail recipients and 45% of nonfrail recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67% and 51%. Frail recipients were 1.29 times (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.66; P = 0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased donor recipients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.44-2.54, P < 0.001) and older adults (age = 65 vs <65; aHR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.96, P = 0.01). Mycophenolate mofetil dose reduction was independently associated with a substantially increased risk of death-censored graft loss (aHR, 5.24; 95%CI, 1.97-13.98, P = 0.001). Conclusion. A better understanding of risk factors forMMF intolerancemight help in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression and prolong allograft survival.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and its prevalence increases with age. Multiple trials have shown that oral antithrombotic therapy with warfarin decrease the risk of ischemic stroke in those with AF. Guidelines recommend treating patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or higher with warfarin or other anticoagulant. It is less clear how to manage frail elderly patients that also have an increased risk of bleeding as calculated by HAS BLED score. We present an 87 year old male on warfarin for atrial fibrillation who fell face forward into the bathtub. CT scan of the face showed a right orbital fracture with a large hematoma. This was his fourth fall in the last 5 years, all resulting in fracture or injury. Other medical history is significant for a recent hemorrhoid bleed requiring blood transfusion, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, abdominal aortic aneurysm, two transient ischemic attacks, osteoarthritis, right sided weakness secondary to polio, hypothyroidism, prostate cancer status post prostatectomy and colon cancer status post partial colectomy. His Barthel Index score is 14, and he is dependent in all instrumental activities of daily living. He uses a walker to ambulate, wears eyeglasses, uses hearing aids, and has upper dentures. He is on a total of 15 medications, including warfarin. His physical exam was remarkable for multiple bruises and right eye proptosis with edema. He was unable to draw a clock and could recall two out of three words. His wife, who is his health care proxy, asks for recommendations regarding re-starting warfarin. Initially we calculated his CHA2DS2- Vasc score (9.6% risk of embolic stroke per year without anticoagulation) and his HAS BLED score (9.9% risk of bleed per year with anticoagulation). Because the two scores were almost identical, they were not helpful informing management. Instead, a detailed goal of care discussion was held with the patient and his wife in which the patient expressed that he was fearful of having a major stroke given his prior history of TIAs, and that he would prefer to continue the anticoagulation even if it results in a major bleed. In summary, although we have many tools that help guide providers' decision making including CHA2DS-VASc and HAS BLED, clinical management of frail elderly patients with multiple comorbidities is often dictated by patient preferences and goals of care.

N2  - Background: Persons living in long term care (LTC) facilities are not well represented in randomized trials that have shown benefit from treatment of hypertension. Our objective was to look at trends in hypertension management in LTC residents to determine if evidence- based guidelines for the management of hypertension released by JNC8 in February 2014 altered practice patterns in our LTC facil ity. These guidelines reduced the goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) for persons aged 60 and over from 140 to 150 mm Hg. For adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and Diabetes, goals are <140/90 mm Hg. Methods: Retrospective chart review was conducted for all LTC residents residing for at least 13 months at a single VA Community Living Center with a diagnosis of hypertension. A 60 day period between 1 September and 31 October 2013 was compared with a 60 day period between 1 September and 31 October 2014 to determine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) means and percent of time BP was above goal based on JNC7 or JNC8 guidelines. Number and class of antihypertensive medications prescribed were calculated. Co-morbid diagnoses including CKD and diabetes were determined for each resident. Results: 28 residents met inclusion criteria. 27 of the 28 residents had a dx of diabetes, CKD or age <60 and 24 of these 27 were at goal of BP <140/90 over 75% of the time in the 2014 sample. Only one resident was aged >60 without diabetes or CKD and they had BP <150/90 over 75% of the time. Overall, 25 (89%) residents were at goal BP per JNC8 guidelines in 2014 versus 21 (75%) residents per JNC7 guidelines in 2013. In 8 residents either number or dose of BP medications was decreased from 2013 to 2014. In 3 patients number of medication or dose was increased. 10 patients (35%) had SBP <120 mmHg over 75% of the time in 2014. Conclusions: Overall BP control in our LTC facility was in line with JNC8 guidelines. Episodes of hypotension and syncope were factors limiting BP control in residents who were not at goal. While JNC8 does not suggest reducing medications in asymptomatic patients who are lower than goal BP, there may be room for medication reduction in a cohort of residents with SBP consistently <120. This would be in line with polypharmacy reduction and avoidance of hypotension in this frail population.

N2  - Background and Aims: Low muscle mass and frailty are major determinants of morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis. Adequate nutritional therapy and early mobilization can impact these parameters. Current cirrhosis guidelines target daily caloric intake at 35-40 kcal/kg and protein intake at 1.2-1.5 g/kg. There are no formal guidelines for mobilization therapy in cirrhosis. Aims: In hospitalized cirrhotic patients, to evaluate the adherence to nutritional guidelines and determine the proportion of cirrhotic patients who had early (within 72 h of study enrollment) mobilization therapy. Methods: Multicenter prospective trial involving 3 hospitals (2 Alberta, 1 Ontario) with data collection over a 13-month period (June 2013-July 2014). All patients had cirrhosis and were recruited within 72 hours of admission. Patients with non-hepatocellular carcinoma related malignancy, palliative HCC, severe end-organ failure (eg. Dialysis, COPD on home oxygen, CHF) or Hepatic encephalopathy Conn's score >1 were excluded. Patients were followed for 30 days from initial assessment or until discharge from hospital. Detailed nutritional and mobilization data was collected over the first 3 days of assessment and at two centers, also at ∼day 8. Results: 137 patients were recruited. Baseline characteristics - Mean age 55.5 (SD: 10.3), 59% male, 77% Caucasian, mean MELD and CP scores 18.2 (6.6) and 9.5 (2.0) respectively. The top three etiologies of liver disease were alcohol (41%), HCV (33%) and autoimmune/cholestatic liver disease (12%). Eighty-two percent had at least mild ascites. The mean estimated dry weight BMI was 24.6 (5.3). By day 3, only 7% and 20% respectively met guideline based calorie and protein targets. In the 44 patients with ∼day 8 data still only 11% and 14% of patients met calorie and protein targets respectively. A subset of 77 patients had mobilization data available. Over days 1-3, 22.1%, 38% and 55% of these patients were able to mobilize/be mobilized from their bed to outside of their hospital room. Only three patients had a formal physiotherapy consult. Conclusions: There is an opportunity to improve on the early nutritional and mobilization therapy in cirrhotic inpatients. Less than 20% of patients met nutritional intake recommendations by day 3 of study enrollment and only 4% received a formal physiotherapy consult. National inpatient cirrhosis care guidelines and standardized orders would allow us to determine whether optimization of these variables can impact clinical outcomes in cirrhosis.

N2  - Background: To evaluate the outcomes of hybrid endovascular repair for thoracic aortic disease involving aortic arch Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis involving patients who underwent hybrid endovascular repair for thoracic aortic disease involving aortic arch. Results: Forty-five patients (35 men; mean age, 66.3±15.4 years) with thoracic aortic disease involving aortic arch were treated by hybrid endovascular repair. The indications for treatment included increased aneurysm size in 28 cases (52.2%), rupture or impending aneurysmal rupture in 10 cases (22.2%), rapid growth of aortic aneurysm (≥10 mm/y) in 5 cases (11.1%), pseudoaneurysm in 2 case (4.4%). Supra-aortic vessel transposition and stent-graft implantation were achieved in all cases. Three types of stent-graft were used, as follows: the Seal thoracic stent-graft in 15 patients (33.3%); the Valiant stent graft in 20 patients (44.4%); and the Zenith TX2 thoracic stent graft in 10 patients (22.2%). Perioperative complications affected 13 patients (28.8%), as follows: stroke (n=3, 6.7%); bleeding (n=1, 2.2%); renal failure (n=4, 8.9%); vascular injury (n=2, 4.4%); retrograde dissection (n=2, 4.4%); and respiratory failure (n=1, 2.2%). Two patients underwent reintervention in hospitalization due to increased size (n=1) and retrograde dissection (n=1). Four patients died within 30 days (8.9%) due to stroke (n=2); bleeding (n=1); and intracranial hemorrhage (n=1). Technical success was achieved in 21 patients (71.1%). Two patients died after discharge during follow-up (mean, 20.1±19.1 months) due to subdural hemorrhage (n=1); and end-stage renal disease (n=1). In 4 patients, reintervention was necessary due to persistent endoleaks (n=2); aortic rupture (n=1); and newly developed retrograde aortic dissection (n=1). The death-free survival and reintervention-free survival rates during follow-up were 82.4% and 76.3%, respectively. Conclusion: For thoracic aortic disease involving aortic arch, hybrid treatment with supra-aortic vessel transposition and endovascular repair may be an option in frail patients in who open procedures is too risky.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high morbidity, mortality, and symptom burden. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) often contribute to these burdens and should be considered when providing recommendations for care. This review aims to summarize recent literature relevant to the provision of palliative and end-of-life care for patients with progressive CKD and specifically highlights issues relevant to those with CVD and CHF.
RECENT FINDINGS: Dialysis may not benefit older, frail patients with progressive CKD, especially those with other comorbidities. Patients managed conservatively (i.e., without dialysis) may live as long as patients who elect to start dialysis, with better preservation of function and quality of life and with fewer acute care admissions. Decisions regarding dialysis initiation should be made on an individual basis, keeping in mind each patient's goals, comorbidities, and underlying functional status. Conservative management of progressive kidney disease is frequently not offered but is likely to benefit many older, frail patients with comorbidities such as CHF and CVD.
SUMMARY: A palliative approach to the care of many patients with progressive CKD is essential to ensuring they receive appropriate quality care.

N2  - This study examined whether chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with recurrent falls in older adults in nursing homes (NHs). We used data abstracted over a six month period from 510 NH residents with a history of falls. Thirty-five percent of the NH residents had CKD. In adjusted analyses, the incidence of recurrent falls was similar in those with and without CKD [fall rate ratio (FRR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.02]. Orthostatic hypotension (FRR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12-2.05), history of falls during the prior six month period (FRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.49), cane or walker use (FRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.16-2.33), and ambulatory dysfunction (FRR 1.47, 95% CI 1.23-1.75) were independently associated with increased fall rate. CKD was not an important predictor of falls in this cohort of nursing home residents with prior falls. Instead, traditional fall risk factors were much more strongly associated with recurrent falls.

N2  - Recurrent event data arise in longitudinal follow-up studies, where each subject may experience the same type of events repeatedly. The work in this article is motivated by the data from a study of repeated peritonitis for patients on peritoneal dialysis. Due to the aspects of medicine and cost, the peritonitis cases were classified into two types: Gram-positive and non-Gram-positive peritonitis. Further, since the death and hemodialysis therapy preclude the occurrence of recurrent events, we face multivariate recurrent event data with a dependent terminal event. We propose a flexible marginal model, which has three characteristics: first, we assume marginal proportional hazard and proportional rates models for terminal event time and recurrent event processes, respectively; second, the inter-recurrences dependence and the correlation between the multivariate recurrent event processes and terminal event time are modeled through three multiplicative frailties corresponding to the specified marginal models; third, the rate model with frailties for recurrent events is specified only on the time before the terminal event. We propose a two-stage estimation procedure for estimating unknown parameters. We also establish the consistency of the two-stage estimator. Simulation studies show that the proposed approach is appropriate for practical use. The methodology is applied to the peritonitis cohort data that motivated this study.

N2  - This paper presents an extension of the joint modeling strategy for the case of multiple longitudinal outcomes and repeated infections of different types over time, motivated by postkidney transplantation data. Our model comprises two parts linked by shared latent terms. On the one hand is a multivariate mixed linear model with random effects, where a low-rank thin-plate spline function is incorporated to collect the nonlinear behavior of the different profiles over time. On the other hand is an infection-specific Cox model, where the dependence between different types of infections and the related times of infection is through a random effect associated with each infection type to catch the within dependence and a shared frailty parameter to capture the dependence between infection types. We implemented the parameterization used in joint models which uses the fitted longitudinal measurements as time-dependent covariates in a relative risk model. Our proposed model was implemented in OpenBUGS using the MCMC approach.

N2  - Background: Environmental lead and cadmium exposure is associated with higher risk of several age-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis. These diseases may lead to frailty, a geriatric syndrome characterized by diminished physiologic reserve in multiple systems with decreased ability to cope with acute stressors. However, no previous study has evaluated the association between lead or cadmium exposure and frailty. Methods: Cross-sectional study among individuals aged ≥60 years who participated in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and had either blood lead (. N=5272) or urine cadmium (. N=4887) determinations. Frailty was ascertained with a slight modification of the Fried criteria, so that individuals meeting ≥3 of 5 pre-defined criteria (exhaustion, low body weight, low physical activity, weakness and slow walking speed), were considered as frail. The association between lead and cadmium with frailty was evaluated using logistic regression with adjustment for relevant confounders. Results: Median (intertertile range) concentrations of blood lead and urine cadmium were 3.9. μg/dl (2.9-4.9) and 0.62. μg/l (0.41-0.91), respectively. The prevalence of frailty was 7.1%. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of frailty comparing the second and third to the lowest tertile of blood lead were, respectively, 1.40 (0.96-2.04) and 1.75 (1.33-2.31). Lead concentrations were also associated with the frequency of exhaustion, weakness and slowness. The corresponding odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for cadmium were, respectively, 0.97 (0.68-1.39) and 1.55 (1.03-2.32), but this association did not hold after excluding participants with reduced glomerular filtration rate: 0.70 (0.43-1.14) and 1.09 (0.56-2.11), respectively. Conclusions: In the US older adult population, blood lead but not urine cadmium concentrations showed a direct dose-response relationship with frailty. These findings support that lead exposure increases frailty in older adults.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Older adults are disproportionately affected by disaster. Frail elders, individuals with chronic diseases, conditions, or disabilities, and those who live in long-term care facilities are especially vulnerable. Purpose The purpose of this integrative review of the literature was to describe the system-wide knowledge and skills that multi-disciplinary health care providers need to provide appropriate care for the elderly during domestic-humanitarian and disaster-relief efforts. Data sources A systematic search protocol was developed in conjunction with a research librarian. Searches of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were conducted using terms such as Disaster, Geological Processes, Aged, Disaster Planning, and Vulnerable Populations. Forty-six articles met criteria for inclusion in the review.
CONCLUSIONS: Policies and guidance regarding evacuating versus sheltering in place are lacking. Tenets of elderly-focused disaster planning/preparation and clarification of legal and ethical standards of care and liability issues are needed. Functional capacity, capabilities, or impairments, rather than age, should be considered in disaster preparation. Older adults should be included in disaster planning as population-specific experts. Implications for Practice A multifaceted approach to population-specific disaster planning and curriculum development should include consideration of the biophysical and psychosocial aspects of care, ethical and legal issues, logistics, and resources.

N2  - BackgroundDiabetes is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Because of conflicting results in observational studies, it is still subject to debate whether in diabetic patients the dialysis modality selected as first treatment (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) may have a major impact on outcomes. We therefore aimed at performing a systematic review of the available evidence. MethodsMEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases were searched until February 2014 for English-language articles without time or methodology restrictions by highly sensitive search strategies focused on diabetes, end-stage kidney disease and dialysis modality. Selection of relevant studies, data extraction and analysis were performed by two independent reviewers. ResultsTwenty-five observational studies (23 on incident and 2 on prevalent cohorts) were included in this review. Mortality was the only main outcome addressed in large cohorts. When considering patient survival, results were inconsistent and varied across study designs, follow-up period and subgroups. We therefore found no evidence-based arguments in favour or against a particular dialysis modality as first choice treatment in patients with diabetes and ESKD. However, peritoneal dialysis (PD) as first choice seems to convey a higher risk of death in elderly and frail patients. ConclusionsThe available evidence derived from observational studies is inconsistent. Therefore evidence-based arguments indicating that HD or PD as first treatment may improve patient-centred outcomes in diabetics with ESKD are lacking. In the absence of such evidence, modality selection should be governed by patient preference, after unbiased patient information.

N2  - Background Dental disease is more extensive in adults with chronic kidney disease, but whether dental health and behaviors are associated with survival in the setting of hemodialysis is unknown. Study Design Prospective multinational cohort. Setting & Participants 4,205 adults treated with long-term hemodialysis, 2010 to 2012 (Oral Diseases in Hemodialysis [ORAL-D] Study). Predictors Dental health as assessed by a standardized dental examination using World Health Organization guidelines and personal oral care, including edentulousness; decayed, missing, and filled teeth index; teeth brushing and flossing; and dental health consultation. Outcomes All-cause and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months after dental assessment. Measurements Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries. Results During a mean follow-up of 22.1 months, 942 deaths occurred, including 477 cardiovascular deaths. Edentulousness (adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.51) and decayed, missing, or filled teeth score ≥ 14 (adjusted HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.33-2.17) were associated with early all-cause mortality, while dental flossing, using mouthwash, brushing teeth daily, spending at least 2 minutes on oral hygiene daily, changing a toothbrush at least every 3 months, and visiting a dentist within the past 6 months (adjusted HRs of 0.52 [95% CI, 0.32-0.85], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64-0.97], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58-0.99], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-0.99], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.95], and 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.96], respectively) were associated with better survival. Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar. Limitations Convenience sample of clinics. Conclusions In adults treated with hemodialysis, poorer dental health was associated with early death, whereas preventive dental health practices were associated with longer survival.

N2  - Background: There is a need to improve end-of-life care for people with end-stage kidney disease, particularly due to the increasingly elderly, frail and co-morbid end-stage kidney disease population. Timely, sensitive and individualised Advance Care Planning discussions are acceptable and beneficial for people with end-stage kidney disease and can help foster realistic hopes and goals. Aim: To explore the experiences of people with end-stage kidney disease regarding starting haemodialysis, its impact on quality of life and their preferences for future care and to explore the Advance Care Planning needs of this population and the timing of this support. Study design: Semi-structured qualitative interview study of people receiving haemodialysis. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Recruitment ceased once data saturation was achieved. Setting/participants: A total of 20 patients at two UK National Health Service hospitals, purposively sampled by age, time on haemodialysis and symptom burden. Results: Themes emerged around: Looking Back, emotions of commencing haemodialysis; Current Experiences, illness and treatment burdens; and Looking Ahead, facing the realities. Challenges throughout the trajectory included getting information, communicating with staff and the 'conveyor belt' culture of haemodialysis units. Participants reported a lack of opportunity to discuss their future, particularly if their health deteriorated, and variable involvement in treatment decisions. However, discussion of these sensitive issues was more acceptable to some than others. Conclusion: Renal patients have considerable unmet Advance Care Planning needs. There is a need to normalise discussions about preferences and priorities in renal and haemodialysis units earlier in the disease trajectory. However, an individualised approach is essential - one size does not fit all.

N2  - Background and objectives Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis; however, previous studies have not taken into account the severity of frailty as a predictor of outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess if there was an association between the degree of frailty and mortality among patients on incident dialysis. Design, setting, participants, &measurements A cohort study of incident chronic dialysis patients was conducted between January of 2009 and June of 2013 (last follow-up in December of 2013). On the basis of overall clinical impression, the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score was determined for patients at the start of dialysis by their primary nephrologist. This simple scale allocates a single point to different states of frailty (1, very fit; 2, well; 3, managing well; 4, vulnerable; 5, mildly frail; 6, moderately frail; 7, severely frail or terminally ill) with an emphasis on function of the assessed individual. The primary outcome was time to death. Patients were censored at the time of transplantation. Results The cohort consisted of 390 patients with completed CFS scores (mean age of 63615 years old). Most were Caucasian (89%) and men (67%), and 30% of patients had ESRD caused by diabetic nephropathy. The median Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 4 (interquartile range =3–6), and the median CFS score was 4 (interquartile range =2–5). There were 96 deaths over 750 patient-years at risk. In an adjusted Cox survival analysis, the hazard ratio associated with each 1-point increase in the CFS was 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.43; P=0.02). Conclusions A higher severity of frailty (as defined by the CFS) at dialysis initiation is associated with higher mortality.

N2  - End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death, the risk of which is presumably related to arrhythmia. Electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters have been found to correlate with arrhythmia and predict cardiovascular outcomes in ESRD patients. Frailty is also a common feature in this population. We investigate whether the severity of dialysis frailty is associated with ECG findings, including PR interval, QRS duration, and QTc interval. Presence and severity of frailty was ascertained using six different self-report questionnaires with proven construct validity. Correlation analysis between frailty severity and ECG was made, and those with significant association entered into multiple regression analysis for confirmation. Among a cohort of chronic hemodialysis patients, we found that frailty severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale, is significantly associated with QRS duration (r = -0.3, p < 0.05). Dialysis patients with QRS longer than 120 ms had significantly lower severity of frailty than those with QRS less than 120 ms (p = 0.01 for the Edmonton frailty scale and 0.05 for simple FRAIL scale). Regression analysis showed that frailty severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale and simple FRAIL scale, was significantly associated with QRS duration independent of serum electrolyte levels. In conclusion, a significant relationship exists between the severity of frailty and QRS duration in ESRD patients. This might be an under-recognized link between frailty and its adverse cardiovascular impact in these patients.

N2  - Frailty is recognized as a crucial determinant of health outcomes; however, objective measures of frailty are rarely employed during the kidney transplant candidate evaluation. To determine if physician (MD) perception of frailty status correlates with objective measurements, consecutive adult kidney transplant candidates evaluated between 5/14-8/14 received frailty grading by the evaluating MD and objective frailty testing utilizing the Rockwood Frailty Index. Of 153 candidates, 10% were objectively Frail, 57% Pre-Frail, and 33% Non-Frail. Frail candidates, compared to Pre-Frail and Non-Frail, were more likely (at p<1.0 level) to have diabetes (66.7% vs. 39.3% vs. 19.6%), low educational attainment (11.3±2.4 vs. 11.9±3.3 vs. 13.3±2.7 years of schooling), public insurance (100% vs. 70.2% vs. 76.5%), Spanish as their primary language (46.7% vs. 33.3% vs. 19.6%), routine use of wheelchair/cane (84.6% vs. 17.6% vs. 5.1%); and less likely to have dialysis duration ≥ 3 years (13.5% vs. 35.8% vs. 50.0%), respectively. Groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and race. MD assessment correlated with objective Frailty in 26.7%, Pre-Frailty in 18.4%, and Non-Frailty in 83.7% (Table 1). MD assessment of combination-Frailty (Frailty+Pre-Frailty) correlated with the objective measurement in 31.1% (Table 2). Subanalysis of Frailty defined only by the physical element of the composite score (defined as Timed Up and Go Test >15 seconds) found that MD assessment correlated with objective measurement in 48.3% (p<0.01). Conclusion: Transplant physician perceptions poorly correlate with objective measurements of frailty and pre-frailty. (Table Presented).

N2  - Frailty may help to predict intensive care unit (ICU) patient outcome. The Dalhousie Clinical Frailty Scale (DCFS) is validated to assess frailty in ambulatory settings but has not been investigated in Australian ICUs. We conducted a prospective three-month study of patients admitted to a tertiary level ICU. Within 24 hours of ICU admission, the next of kin or nurse in charge assigned a DCFS score to the patient. Data were obtained to assess the association between frailty and patient outcome. The DCFS score was completed in 205 of 348 (59%) of eligible patient admissions. The mean DCFS score was 3.2 (±1.6). Overall frailty (DCFS >4) occurred in 28 of 205 patients (13%, confidence interval 9% to 17%), 13 of 93 (15%, confidence interval 10% to 25%) in patients aged >65 years and 5 of 11 (45%, confidence interval 21% to 71%) in those >85 years. Patients with chronic liver disease (P <0.001) and end-stage renal failure (P=0.009) were more likely to be frail. The DCFS score was not significantly associated with ICU or hospital mortality: odds ratio 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.6 to 1.6) and odds ratio 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 1.4), respectively. However, after adjustment for illness severity and requirement for palliative care, the DCFS score was significantly associated with increased (log) hospital length-of-stay (P=0.04) and age (P=0.001). Approximately 1 in 10 ICU patients were frail and this frequency increased with age. The DCFS was associated with patient age and comorbidities and potentially predicts increased hospital length-of-stay but not other outcomes. Strategies to improve compliance with DCFS completion are needed.

N2  - Learning Objectives: 1. Learn about the components of frailty among seniors and how they impact surgical care and outcomes 2. Understand simple screening tests for frailty that can help prevent issues among seniors undergoing transplantation 3. Learn about interventions to improve the care of frail seniors undergoing transplantation Background: Aging in America: The Silver Tsunami Seniors over the age of 65 years represent 13.1% of the United States population, with a projected 36% increase to 55 million by the year 2020.1,2 With advancing age, seniors experience an increased prevalence in memory loss, physical disability, and multiple chronic conditions (e.g., heart disease, emphysema, stroke, diabetes, cancers, hypertension, arthritis, osteoporosis, and macular degeneration).3-7 Frailty is defined as a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors, resulting from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems, and causing vulnerability to adverse outcomes.1 Frailty is considered highly prevalent in old age and to confer high risk for falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. 2 Frailty exists as a clinical syndrome in which three or more of the following are present: unintentional weight loss (10 lbs in past year), self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity.3 Increases in Seniors Receiving Transplantation Kidney transplantation is a viable treatment option for seniors affected by end stage renal disease (ESRD).1-3 As the population ages, increasing numbers of patients aged <65 years are developing ESRD and considering renal replacement therapy, including kidney transplantation.4 According to data in the United States Renal Data System, older adults aged 60-75 years have seen a two-fold increase in access to transplants between the years 1995 and 2006.5 Kidney transplantation is known to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve quality of life in seniors, and is more cost-effective compared to other renal replacement options, such as hemodialysis.6-9 Issue: Seniors who are planning to undergo transplantation have specialized needs related to their frailty that should be recognized and evaluated in order to provide optimal care. Geriatric Frailty and Appropriate Screening Testing: 1. Evaluating Malnutrition - Unintentional weight loss is a marker of frailty. Simple screening tests to be used include repeated scale measures of weight, serum Albumin, and calorie counts. 2. Activity/Functional Level - Seniors who are less functional or active are more likely to have post-operative issues. Testing can be performed using the Get up and Go test (assessing the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk a distance, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down), checking the Katz Activities of Daily Living, or using a hand dynamometer 3. Cognition - Seniors with cognitive impairment may or may not openly exhibit symptoms. Screening tests include the Mini-Cog (3 words, clock draw, recall of 3 words) or Montreal Cognitive Test. Real World Interventions to Optimize the Care of Frail Seniors 1. Consult Geriatrician or Geriatrics Team 2. Liberalize diet, nutritional supplements 3. Therapy - physical, occupational, speech 4. Tai Chi and exercises. 5. Reducing medications that increase frailty and cognitive impairment 6. Increasing caregiver support for seniors with impaired cognition (Endnotes).

N2  - At least in Germany the average age of patients on dialysis is steadily increasing. They exhibit to a high degree characteristics typical of geriatric patients, of which an important one is frailty. Frailty is closely associated with a restricted life expectancy and in particular with a reduced quality of life of these patients, often more than the underlying disease(s). Improvement of symptoms going along with frailty requires targeted multimodal (rehabilitative) therapeutic approaches, usually by a multi-professional team. Interventions should be based on appropriate assessments. With chronic renal disease and dialysis patients these approaches have so far been relatively seldomly applied, although, according to current knowledge, they are as effective as in patients without renal disease.

N2  - In the age of person-centered care, there is an emphasis on promoting patient autonomy and surrogate decision maker authority in making treatment decisions that are aligned with the patient's priorities and values. As technological advances offer multiple clinical options with various levels and types of risks and benefits, person-centered clinical practice encourages the incorporation of patients' and families' heterogeneous experiences into decisions regarding illness management. In caring for frail elderly adults, clinicians are sometimes faced with situations in which individuals and their surrogate decision-makers request a treatment that the clinicians feel is clinically inappropriate. This article provides a case example of a frail older adult with advanced chronic kidney disease who requests dialysis despite the advice of his nephrologist to pursue conservative management. The four-box approach, which provides clinicians with a structured ethical framework to facilitate informed and ethically justified treatment decisions, is then introduced. By considering the patient's medical indications, preferences, quality of life, and contextual factors, how each consideration plays a unique yet equally important role in informing clinically responsible and person-centered care is illustrated.

N2  - Context: Coronary artery disease is highly prevalent among patients with end stage renal disease/hemodialysis (ESRD/HD) and coronary percutaneous interventions (PCI) has been increased by nearly 50% over the past decade. After PCI with stent placement, guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), but no specifically tailored pharmacotherapy approach is outlined for this frail population, mostly excluded from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Evidence Acquisition: We reviewed current evidences on the use of antiplatelet therapy in patients with ESRD/HD undergoing PCI, focusing on the efficacy and safety of specific agents and their indications for detailed clinical settings. Results: Clinical setting in HD patients is the principal determinant of the type, onset, combination and duration of the DAPT. However, irrespective clinical setting, in addition to aspirin, clopidogrel is currently the most used antiplatelet agent even if no information derived from RCTs are available in ESRD. Due to the large experience acquired in routine clinical practice, the awareness of safety is higher for clopidogrel than newer antiplatelet agents. Because of lack of data, the use of prasugrel and ticagrelor is actually not recommended. However, in case of high ischemic and acceptable bleeding risk, they may be selectively used in ESRD/HD.Conclusions: This investigation might contribute to delineate the best treatment options for this high risk population.

N2  - Background: We have previously described strong associations between frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, and early hospital readmission as well as delayed graft function. The goal of this study was to estimate its association with post-KT mortality. Methods: Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of transplantation between 12/08-8/13. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach, the hybrid registry-augmented regression, to substantially improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of the SRTR (n=37,858) and introduced these into the single-center model which then estimated the adjusted frailty coefficient. Results: At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5%, 86.0% and 77.5% for non-frail, intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95%CI: 1.01-4.65, P=0.047) higher risk of death (Table). There was a “dose response” of frailty, such that the risk of mortality was lowest for the nonfrail, greater for the intermediately frail and greatest for the frail KT recipients (P for trend=0.013). Results were similar in a sensitivity analysis when we directly adjusted for the confounders in a single-center forced model. Discussion: In conclusion, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent risk factor for post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many confounders using a novel, efficient statistical approach. (Table Presented).

N2  - We have previously described strong associations between frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, and early hospital readmission as well as delayed graft function. The goal of this study was to estimate its association with postkidney transplantation (post-KT) mortality. Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to substantially improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients (n=37 858) and introduced these into the single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5%, 86.0% and 77.5% for nonfrail, intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.01-4.65, p=0.047) higher risk of death. In conclusion, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent risk factor for post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many confounders using a novel, efficient statistical approach. In a prospective, single-center, longitudinal cohort study of kidney transplant recipients, the authors find that frailty was a strong predictor of mortality, independent of and beyond registry-based predictors.

N2  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors such as canagliflozin and dapagliflozin have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A PubMed search was conducted of the literature from April 1996 to August 2014 to identify all human studies related to SGLT2 inhibitors. Pertinent guidelines of experts and the prescribing information for canagliflozin and dapagliflozin are reviewed. SGLT2 inhibitors may be used as an add-on therapy in select and relatively healthy older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are overweight and have uncontrolled hypertension. These medications should be avoided in patients who are frail, who have chronic kidney disease, and in conjunction with insulin or sulfonylureas.

N2  - A chronic disease in older adults usually runs a course that is less predictable than in younger individuals. Unexplained variations in disease incidence, prognosis, therapeutic responses, and toxicity are frequently observed among older adults. This heterogeneity poses huge challenges to the current one-size-fits-All health care systems, and calls for more personalized managements of chronic diseases in older adults. Aging is characterized by progressive deterioration of bodily functions with increasing risk of failure over time. The entire process is hierarchically organized, and progresses from intracellular events to changes at systemic and ultimately organism levels at different rates among different individuals. Aging biology exerts great influences on the development and progression of most age-related chronic diseases. Thus, aging biology could contribute to the complexity of illnesses that increase with age, and aging biomarkers possess a great potential to enable personalized health risk assessment and health care. We review evidences supporting the roles of aging biomarkers in risk assessment of prevalent age-related diseases. Frailty phenotype is an objectively measured indicator of advanced-stage aging that is characterized by organism-level dysfunction. In contrast, altered inflammation markers level signifies an earlier stage between cellular abnormalities and systems dysfunction. Results of human observational studies and randomized controlled trials indicate that these measures, albeit simple, greatly facilitate classification of older patients with cancer, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus into groups that vary in disease incidence, prognosis and therapeutic response/toxicity. As the detailed mechanisms underlying the complex biologic process of aging are unraveled in the future, a larger array of biomarkers that correlate with biologic aging at different stages will be discovered. Following the translational research framework described in this article, these research efforts would result in innovations in disease prevention and management that address the huge unmet health needs of aging populations.

N2  - Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are more and more prominent medications in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), with five molecules commercialized and as many fixed-dose combinations with metformin. After failure of metformin monotherapy, gliptins compete with old medications such as sulphonylureas, on the one hand, or with new oral antidiabetic agents such as inhibitors of renal sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) (gliflozines), on the other hand. Another alternative is the use of an incretin mimetic (agonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors, to be injected subcutaneously) rather than an incretin enhancer such as a gliptin, before considering insulin therapy. This article analyses the arguments in favour of DPP-4 inhibitors. We will mainly consider the use of gliptins in patients with recently diagnosed T2D, in elderly and frail patients and in those with chronic kidney disease. To illustrate the discussion, we will analyze the results of both interventional and observational studies with vildagliptin. Obviously, these various groups of patients represent a large proportion of T2D population.

N2  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder, which can potentially increases the risk of stroke by five-fold, thus, resulting in high public healthcare burden. Stroke prevention is vital in the management of AF patients. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA, eg, warfarin) have been the mainstay treatment to prevent ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism in AF patients for several decades. Despite the efficacy of warfarin, its limitations have recently driven the advent of some new antithrombotic agents, the non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOACs, including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). The NOACs have changed the landscape for thromboembolic prophylaxis among patients with nonvalvular AF. Although three NOACs thus far (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) have been approved in Europe and the United States, for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF on the basis of several Phase III clinical trials, warfarin still remain important in preventing stroke for patients. This is especially true for those with optimal control of international normalized ratio with high (>70 %) time in therapeutic range, valvular AF or associated prosthetic valve. These NOACs are attractive alternatives for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF who are unable or unwilling to receive warfarin. However, several issues should be taken into consideration on safe and effective use of these NOACs in day-to-day clinical practice, for example, pharmacological properties, drug interactions, monitoring and compliance, and treatment of frail elderly patients or patients with renal impairment, etc. The decision about whether to initiate oral anticoagulation either with warfarin or NOACs should be patient-centered and after consideration of both stroke and bleeding risks. It is important for clinical practitioner to offer patients with AF an individualized decision about drug choice, making decision after adequate patient education plus discussion about the risks and benefits of these agents, thus fitting the drug to the patient profile.

N2  - Background: The hospital length of stay (LOS) for kidney transplantation (KT) affects both transplant costs and patient outcomes, yet little is known about the predictors of LOS for KT recipients. The goal of this study was to identify factors associated with LOS using national registry data and primary cohort data that captures a novel risk factor, frailty. Methods: We studied adult KT recipients (aged≥18) between 1990-2011 (n=149,833) using SRTR data. We also prospectively measured frailty in 521 KT recipients between 12/08-8/13 at our center, and linked these measurements to SRTR data. Using Poisson regression, we estimated the incident rate ratio (IRR) of LOS for recipient, donor and transplant factors. We additionally tested whether frailty was associated with KT LOS independent of registry-based predictors. Results: LOS has decreased over time (1994-1996: mean 13.5 days; 2009-2011: 7.0 days; P<0.001). ECD donor (IRR=1.19; 95%CI:1.19-1.20; P<0.001) and longer CIT (25-36 hours: IRR=1.28; 95%CI: 1.27-1.29; P36 hours: IRR=1.25; 95% CI:1.23- 1.26; P<0.001) were the strongest predictors of LOS (Table). Additionally, frail KT recipients had 1.10-fold longer (95% CI:1.03-1.18; P=0.005) LOS and intermediately frail recipients had a 1.20-fold longer (95%CI: 1.14-1.27; P<0.001) LOS than nonfrail KT recipients, even after accounting for the variables in the SRTR model. Conclusion: Clinicians may use recipient, donor and transplant factors to identify those at risk of longer hospital stays after KT and use this information to inform the development of more efficient clinical pathways for these patients.

N2  - Peritoneal dialysis is troubled with declining utilisation as a form of renal replacement therapy in developed countries. We review key aspects of therapy evidenced to have a potential to increase its utilisation. The best evidence to repopulate PD programmes is provided for the positive impact of timely referral and systematic and motivational predialysis education: average odds ratio for instituting peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis was 2.6 across several retrospective studies on the impact of predialysis education. Utilisation of PD for unplanned acute dialysis starts facilitated by implantation of peritoneal catheters by interventional nephrologists may diminish the vast predominance of haemodialysis done by central venous catheters for unplanned dialysis start. Assisted peritoneal dialysis can improve accessibility of home based dialysis to elderly, frail, and dependant patients, whose quality of life on replacement therapy may benefit most from dialysis performed at home. Peritoneal dialysis providers should perform close monitoring, preventing measures, and timely prophylactic therapy in patients judged to be prone to EPS development. Each peritoneal dialysis programme should regularly monitor, report, and act on key quality indicators to manifest its ability of constant quality improvement and elevate the confidence of interested patients and financing bodies in the programme.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Physical activity questionnaires usually focus on moderate to vigorous activities and may not accurately capture physical activity or variation in levels of activity among extremely inactive groups like dialysis patients.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Three dialysis facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area.
SUBJECTS: Sixty-eight prevalent hemodialysis patients.
INTERVENTION: We administered a new physical activity questionnaire designed to capture activity in the lower end of the range, the Low Physical Activity Questionnaire (LoPAQ).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Outcome measures were correlation with a validated physical activity questionnaire, the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity (LTA) questionnaire and with self-reported physical function (physical function score of the SF-36) and physical performance (gait speed, chair stand, balance, and short physical performance battery). We also determined whether patients who were frail or reported limitations in activities of daily living were less active on the LoPAQ.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight participants (mean age 59 ± 14 years, 59% men) completed the study. Patients were inactive according to the LoPAQ, with a median (interquartile range) of 517 (204-1190) kcal/week of physical activity. Although activity from the LTA was lower than on the LoPAQ (411 [61-902] kcal/week), the difference was not statistically significant (P = .20), and results from the 2 instruments were strongly correlated (rho = 0.62, P < .001). In addition, higher physical activity measured by the LoPAQ was correlated with better self-reported functioning (rho = 0.64, P < .001), better performance on gait speed (rho = 0.32, P = .02), balance (rho = 0.45, P < .001), and chair rising (rho = -0.32, P = .03) tests and with higher short physical performance battery total score (rho = 0.51, P < .001). Frail patients and patients with activities of daily living limitations were less active than those who were not frail or limited.
CONCLUSIONS: The LoPAQ performed similarly to the Minnesota LTA questionnaire in our cohort despite being shorter and easier to administer.

N2  - The benefit of exercise during dialysis has been proven in numerous studies worldwide. Yet, only a few dialysis units in Germany offer exercise therapy to their patients. One reason is that a standardized exercise program which can be integrated into dialysis routine over long times is missing. Such a structured program for exercise during dialysis was developed by us and has been successfully executed for some years now during routine dialysis treatment. Our program (Saxonian Physical Exercise Program (SPEP)) as described in detail in this article introduces individualized exercise therapy and is therefore suitable for all patients including the elderly and frail patients for whom its effects have been shown to be particularly positive.

N2  - Falls and mineral and bones disorders are both implicated in the occurrence of pathological fractures in patients undergoing chronic dialysis. However, data on falls among this population are rare. We carried out a prospective study during four weeks and included 70 patients on chronic hemodialysis with the main objectives being to evaluate the incidence of falls and factors related to it. At the end of the four weeks, 16 patients (22.86%) fell at least once, with a total of 17 falls during 4 weeks, giving an incidence of 3.2 falls per patient/year. The mean age was 40 ± 16 years. Five patients (31.2%) had a past history of pathological fractures. Ten patients (62.5%) presented intra- and post-dialysis hypotension, six (37.5%) was diagnosed of gait disorders and two (12.5%) had sensory deficit of the lower limbs. Six patients (37.5%) presented frailty. Hypotension (P = 0.004), frailty (P = 0.047) and sensory deficit (P = 0.049) were significantly associated with the occurrence of falls. The incidence of falls is relatively high in our hemodialysis patients and real risk factors exist. Hence, it is important to implement programs for falls prevention to reduce their incidence and impact.

N2  - Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are life-threatening complications after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only half of CD20-positive PTLDs respond to rituximab monotherapy, and outcomes remain poor for patients with relapsed/refractory disease, especially those who do not qualify for an anthracycline containing regimen due to frailty or comorbidities. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) might be an option in this particular setting. We report a panel of eight patients with rituximab refractory/relapsed CD20-positive PTLDs including three ineligible for subsequent CHOP-like chemotherapy who received <sup>90</sup>Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan as a single agent (n-=-7) or combined to chemotherapy (n-=-1). Five out of eight patients were kidney transplant recipients, while 2/8 had a liver transplant and 1/8 had a heart transplant. Patients received a median of two previous therapies. Overall response rate was 62.5%. Importantly, all responders achieved complete response. At a median follow-up of 37 months [5; 84], complete response was ongoing in four patients. Toxicity was predominantly hematological and easily manageable. No graft rejection was noticed concomitantly or following RIT administration despite immunosuppression reduction after diagnosis of PTLDs. This report emphasizes the potential efficiency of salvage RIT for early rituximab refractory PTLDs without any unexpected toxicity. Radioimmunotherapy with <sup>90</sup>Yttrium-ibritumomab-tiuxetan either as a single agent or combined with chemotherapy is effective and safe in patients with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders failing immunosuppression reduction and at least one rituximab-containing regimen.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The population considered eligible for dialysis has expanded dramatically over the past 4 decades, so that a significant proportion of patients receiving renal replacement therapy are elderly, frail and infirm. These patients have an extremely limited life expectancy and suffer from significant symptom burden, similar to patients with other end-stage organ failure or cancer. As dialysis has been offered more broadly, it is now initiated earlier than in decades past, further adding to cost and patient burden.
RECENT FINDINGS: The trend toward more expansive and intensive care has not been corroborated by robust data. In response, an increasing number of studies has focused on establishing reasonable limits to renal replacement therapy. Multiple authors have explored the role of conservative kidney management for high-risk dialysis patients as an alternative to dialysis, which may offer similar survival and improved quality of life in certain populations. For those who chose dialysis, deferring initiation until the patient becomes symptomatic may be a reasonable. Evidence-based symptom management guidelines for dialysis patients remain largely absent, with few proven approaches. Hospice and palliative care resources remain underutilized.
SUMMARY: For a subset of dialysis patients, palliative care and conservative kidney management are appropriate and underutilized.

N2  - Introduction: Frailty has recently been shown to be associated with increased risk of death after continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) implantation as destination therapy (DT), but no data exists specifically analyzing its association with specific early and late adverse events. Methods: Between February 2007 and May 2014, 251 patients (205 male) underwent primary implantation of CF-LVAD at our institution; 157 (63%) were implanted as DT and preoperative frailty assessment was available in 96 pt. Frailty was identified in 58/96 (60%) patients according to the deficit index (31 impairments, disabilities and comorbidities) and defined as gt; 25% deficits. Age (67 vs. 64 years, p=0.12), male sex (79% vs. 87%, 0.63), chronic kidney disease (64% vs. 63%, p=0.74), creatinine (1.7 vs. 1.5, p=0.1), hemoglobin (11.6 vs. 11.5, p=0.98), and albumin levels (3.7 vs. 3.8, p=0.53) were similar between frail and non-frail pt, while diabetes (59% vs. 13%, plt;0.001), ischemic etiology (64% vs. 45%, p=0.04), and preop balloon pump (50% vs. 26%, p=0.01) were significantly different. Results: All patients underwent CF-LVAD implantation and cardiopulmonary bypass time was similar between groups (102 vs. 111 min., p=0.3). There were no significant differences in early adverse events between frail and non-frail pt, including inotrope duration (120 vs. 96 hr., p=0.11), right ventricular failure (19% vs. 13%, p=0.44), respiratory failure (26% vs. 18%, p=0.34), acute renal failure (16% vs. 13%, p=0.69), and hepatic dysfunction (16% vs. 13%, p=0.69). Median length of stay (20 vs. 16 days, p=0.25) and early mortality (12% vs. 8%, p=0.48) were also similar. During a median follow up of 2 years with 224 patient/years of support, any GI bleed (43% vs. 42%, p=0.79), any thromboembolic event (34% vs. 39%, p=0.74), and driveline infection (10% vs. 26%, p=0.052). Conclusions: In this select cohort of patients, frailty did not portend higher risk of adverse events after CF-LVAD implantation for DT despite prior observation that late survival is reduced in these patients. These findings are extremely important in patient selection and counseling of patients prior to LVAD implantation.

N2  - The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising, particularly among the elderly population. Defining aging as successful or unsuccessful has become clinically relevant in the last 15 years, with an increased recognition of the frail phenotype. Frailty has been shown to be associated with CKD and poorer outcomes, such as death or dialysis. It is likely that the mechanisms of disease in CKD such as altered protein metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and anemia accelerate normal aging and lead to worsening frailty in elderly patients with CKD.

N2  - Older adults presenting with unexplained decline in renal and cognitive function should be evaluated for polypharmacy as a potential cause. The authors report the case of a patient admitted to hospice for end-stage renal disease, progressive dementia, and failure to thrive. After stopping and/or reducing the dose of eight different medications, she showed dramatic improvements in her glomerular filtration rate, cognition, functional status, and weight, leading to her discharge from hospice care. Although none of her medications were known to be nephrotoxic, she had been taking several medications at doses higher than those recommended for her degree of renal impairment. She was also receiving several inappropriate medications per the American Geriatrics Society's Updated Beers criteria. This case highlights the positive impact that careful medication reviews and adjustments can have in elderly patients with renal impairment, including trials of stopping potentially unnecessary and inappropriate medications.

N2  - We are witnessing a trend towards reduced numbers of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis, reduction in clinical expertise and research work in this area. We present several key opportunities and strategies for revitalisation of PD programs with a special emphasis on their feasibility and background evidence. Timely referral and proper pre-dialysis education are two crucial factors with largest potential to repopulate PD programs. Clinicians should consider using PD for unplanned acute dialysis starts. Implantation of peritoneal catheters by interventional nephrologists has a potential to alleviate some of the problems and barriers often encountered when other profiles take care of dialysis access. The possibility to offer assisted peritoneal dialysis to elderly frail patients should be part of all modern PD programs, since these are the patients whose quality of life on replacement therapy may benefit most from assisted modality performed in patient's home. The concept of “expiry date for PD” should be abandoned and replaced by a close monitoring, preventing measures, and timely prophylactic therapy in patients judged to be prone to EPS development.

N2  - Background: Elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis and numerous cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities are currently considered for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). TAVI is effective in alleviating valve-related symptoms and restoring quality of life. However, many patients remain frail and in a vulnerable clinical condition after successful TAVI. The aim of this study was to assess rates and reasons for rehospitalization within one year after TAVI. Methods: Between August 2007 and September 2012, 549 consecutive patients with degenerative aortic stenosis underwent TAVI using different access routes and devices and were included into a prospective registry. Active follow-up was scheduled at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year. All hospital readmissions were ascertained and major adverse events were adjudicated according to the VARC2 standardized endpoint definitions. Results: Of 549 patients undergoing TAVI, 529(96.4%) were alive at the end of the index hospitalization and discharged. Of these, 138(26.1%) patients were readmitted within 1 year of discharge and included in the present analysis. Patients with at least one readmission had presented with higher logistic EuroScore (25.1±16 vs. 22.1±13mmHg,p=0.01), higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure (55.5±19 vs. 50.2±16mmHg,p=0.02), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (49.0±16 vs. 53.3±14mmHg, p=0.009) and more frequently had previous myocardial infarction (21.7% vs. 13%,p=0.02). Overall, 176 readmissions occurred during the observational period with a cumulative mean hospital duration of 15.6±16 days. Among readmitted patients, 73 patients(41.5%) were re-evaluated for cardiovascular causes (heart failure 17%, peripheral vascular disease 15%, 2% for valvular heart disease), 22 (13%) for gastrointestinal, 12 (7%) for respiratory and 8 patients (5%) for chronic kidney disease. Twenty-two patients (13%) received non-cardiac surgery and 8 patients (5%) were found to have a malignant tumor. Conclusions: Within the first year after TAVI, one out of four patients is readmitted to the hospital. Cardiac causes and vascular disease are among the most frequent reasons for rehospitalization, while readmission for valve related issues is rare.

N2  - Introduction: Prognosis of the increasing number elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is poor with high risk for functional decline and mortality. Frailty seems to be a good predictor for those patients that will not benefit from dialysis. Varying prevalences between populations are probably related to the instrument used. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of frailty among ESRD patients with two different validated instruments. Methods: Cross-sectional study among patients, aged ≥18 years, receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis care between Sept 2013 and Dec 2013 in a single dialysis center in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands. Frailty was measured with the Frailty Index (FI) and Frailty Phenotype (FP). Results: Prevalence of frailty by the FI was 36.8% among 95 participants with ESRD (age:65.2 years, SD±12.0). Frailty prevalence among participants aged ≥65 years and <65 years was 43.6% and 27.5%, respectively. Female gender [odds ratio (OR): 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3-8.0] and a Charlson comorbidity index score of ≥5 (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.0-6.6) were associated with frailty. The FI identified different but overlapping participants as frail compared with the FP; 62.5% of frail participants according to FI were also frail according to the FP. Conclusions: Prevalence of frailty among young and elderly ESRD patients is high, being female and having a high Charlson comorbidity index was associated with frailty. Use of a broader definition of frailty, like the FI, gives a higher estimation of prevalence among ESRD patients compared with a physical frailty assessment.

N2  - Background: Currently over 55% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are aged ≥60 years and patients >75 years represent the fastest growing segment of the dialysis population. We aimed to assess whether the Groningen frailty indicator (GFI) can be used to distinguish fit older ESRD patients, likely able to tolerate and benefit from dialysis, from frail older patients who need further evaluation with a geriatrician's comprehensive assessment. Methods: All patients aged ≥65 years visiting the pre-dialysis unit at the Gelre hospital between 2007-2013 were included and underwent the GFI (n = 65). Patients with GFI ≥4 (frail) were referred for geriatric consultation (n = 13). Results of the GFI and nephrologists' evaluation were compared with geriatrician's assessment. Survival rates and outcomes after one year of follow up were recorded. Results: 20 patients (32%) were identified as frail. Of the problems identified by the geriatrician in 13 patients, 55% were not reported in the nephrologists' notes. The first year after inclusion, 30% of patients with a GFI ≥4 died, compared to 9% of fit patients (p = 0.04). Moreover, 90% of frail patients had been hospitalized one or more times, compared to 53% in the fit group (p = 0.005). Conclusion: Although the GFI can be a useful instrument to identify ESRD patients at risk, both the GFI and the nephrologists' assessment failed to identify specific geriatric impairments. Further research is needed to develop a specific frailty indicator for ESRD patients and to determine the value and effect of an comprehensive geriatric assessment in ESRD patients.

N2  - Introduction: Population ageing is accelerating rapidly worldwide. Acute coronary syndrome among older patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In developed countries, there is an increase in the number of older patients managed by invasive strategy including coronary angiography (CA), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Frailty is emerging as an independent marker of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and its prevalence among older patients undergoing invasive treatment in the setting of Non ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome (NSTEACS) is not known. Purpose: To determine the prevalence of frailty in ≥75 year old patients presenting with NSTEACS managed by invasive treatment in a tertiary cardiac centre. Methods: Over a period of 12 months from February 2013 to January 2014, 110 ≥75 year old consecutive patients admitted for invasive management of NSTEACS were recruited into an ongoing study (ICON1-A Study to Improve Cardiovascular Outcomes in High Risk PatieNts with Acute Coronary Syndrome) to a tertiary cardiac centre. Frailty was evaluated using the Fried criteria. A score of ≥3 is classified as frail, 1 or 2 as pre-frail and 0 as robust. Results: The mean age was 81.6 years (standard deviation [SD] 4.3 years). 55 (50%) were females. 95 (86%) were managed by PCI, 5 (4%) by CABG (1 patient had staged CABG after PCI) and 11 (10%) patients were managed by medical treatment after CA. As per Fried Frailty Criteria; 36 (32.7%) were frail, 58 (52.7%) pre-frail and 16 (14.5%) were robust. All patients in the robust group were managed by invasive strategy (PCI or CABG) while only 88.3% frail/pre-frail patients were managed invasively. Previous MI was more common in the frail group versus pre-frail or robust (52.8% vs. 32.8% vs. 6.3%; p<0.05) groups respectively, as was previous cerebrovascular disease (33.3% vs. 17.2% vs. 6.3%; p=0.05), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (30.5% vs. 12% vs. 12.5%; p=0.06) and chronic kidney disease (22.2% vs. 13.75% vs. 0%; p=0.10). Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score (out of 30 points) also declined with increasing frailty (mean±SD: Robust-22.8±4.0 vs. Pre-frail-25.9±2.1 vs. Frail-26.0±1.8; p<0.001). Conclusion: Frailty is common among older (≥75 years) patients presenting with NSTEACS for invasive management. One third of the patients are frail and more than half of the patients are pre-frail. Frailty can play an important role in risk stratification for better management of older patients and should be evaluated in the routine clinical care of these patients.

N2  - Treatment with dialysis has benefitted large numbers of patients with advanced kidney disease. It is though highly intrusive and demanding and some elderly, frail patients may tolerate it poorly. Some of these patients who are either approaching 'end-stage' kidney disease or 'failing' despite being on dialysis may choose to pursue supportive or palliative approaches, partially or fully replacing the dialysis option. Here, we describe some of the challenges confronting these patients and present data on the attitudes and perceptions to supportive care and end-of-life care planning of patients on haemodialysis including some whose prognosis was poor. The main focus for these patients appeared to be on holding on to what they had, adapting by living 'from day to day' in the present, and continuing to hope for the best. Advance care planning was seen as potentially useful by patients, once clarity surrounding its purpose had been established.

N2  - Background: Anaemia is a common condition of the elderly and prevalence increases with age. Anaemia in the elderly is often mild and well tolerated. However, it can have an important impact on the quality of life of older patients. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of anaemia among 100 consecutive patients attending a Day Hospital. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of 100 consecutive new patient referrals to our outpatient day assessment unit in this University Hospital. We analysed the haematological and biochemical laboratory results to identify the prevalence and aetiology of anaemia. A haemoglobin concentration of<12 g/dl was considered to constitute anaemia in an elderly population regardless of gender 1. Patients with anaemia were further subclassified into microcytic, macrocytic and normocytic anaemia respectively. Results: The 100 elderly patients, 38 were males (38 %) and 62 were females (62 %). The mean age was 83 years (SD 6.41, range 66-99). The mean Hb was 12.84 g/dl. There were 19 patients with a Hb <12 g/dl (range 8.7-11.9 g/dl) and 5 of those patients had a Hb <10 g/dl. The vast majority were normocytic normochromic anaemia 16 (84.2 %) and microcytic anaemia 3 (15.8 %), there was no macrocytic anaemia. Aetiology of anaemia were as follows; iron deficiency anaemia n = 8 (42.1 %), vitamin B12 deficiency n = 1 (0.05 %) and anaemia related to chronic kidney disease n = 2 (10.5 %). Conclusion: Anaemia is prevalent condition in the elderly and is often multifactorial. However, all cases of anaemia should mandate thorough investigation and treatment where appropriate in a frail population.

N2  - Introduction: The number of elderly patients accepted in renal replacement programmes is increasing. There is a general agreement that age per se does not constitute a contraindication to transplantation. Many centres are still reluctant to accept patients >60 years old, as they are frail, have more comorbid conditions and their overall life expectancy is lower. The aim of this study was to investigate transplantation provides any survival benefit or not in this group of patients. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective case control analysis study in elderly patients (Group I; >60 years). Data were compared to those obtained in patients (Group II) who were matched for HLA mismatches and time of follow up but not with recipients' age (20-50).Primary end points are Graft loss and/or patient death, while secondary end point are Cerebro-cardiovascular events, malignancies or rejection. Results: Thirty-two patients with mean age(±SD) 63.4(±3.2), ranged from 60 to 73 years old (11 females and 21 males) were compared with 32 patients with mean age(±SD) 33.5(±7.46) ranged from 21 to 50 (11 females and 21 males). There is no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the result of mean s.creatinine after 1 year while mean s.creatinine after 3 years in Gr II is significantly higher than Gr I (p<0.003)and prevalence of malignancy was similar in both groups (one patient in each group). Seven graft were lost in Gr I (6 due to patient deaths and 1 from trauma) while only 1 was lost in Gr II (due to renal vein thrombosis) (p <0.01). Conclusions: Elderly age was associated with lower number of graft losses due to rejection, while they had higher death rate result in significantly worse overall renal transplant survival.

N2  - Background: Most studies and national programs aggregate the different types of surgical site infections (SSIs) potentially masking and misattributing risk. Determining that risk factors for superficial, deep, and organ space SSIs are unique is essential to improve SSI rates. Methods: This cohort study utilized data of 59,365 patients who underwent colon resection at hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2007 to 2009. Four independent, multivariable, predictive models were developed to assess the unique associations between risk factors and each SSI group: Superficial, deep, organ space, and an aggregate of all 3 types of SSIs. Results: Overall, 13% of colon cases developed SSIs: Superficial (8%), deep (1.4%), and organ space (3.8%). Each model was different. Morbidly obese patients were more likely to develop SSIs than normal weight patients across all models; however, risk factors common to all models (eg, body mass index [BMI], duration of operation, wound class, laparoscopic approach) had very different levels of risk. Unique risks for superficial SSIs include diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dyspnea. Deep SSIs had the greatest magnitude of association with BMI and the greatest incidence of wound disruption (19.8%). Organ space SSIs were often owing to anastomotic leaks and were uniquely associated with disseminated cancer, preoperative dialysis, preoperative radiation treatment, and a bleeding disorder, suggesting a physically frail or compromised patient may put the anastomosis at risk. Conclusion: Risk factors for superficial, deep, and organ space SSI differ. More effective prevention strategies may be developed by reporting and examining each type of SSI separately. © 2014 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Today, old age does not represent a formal contraindication to kidney transplantation. Rather, there is evidence that in elderly patients renal transplantation offers longer life expectancy and better quality of life in comparison with dialysis. Yet, the results of renal transplantation in recipients older than 65 years are inferior to those observed in younger adults, death with functioning graft representing a major cause of failure. Therefore, the selection of aged patients is of paramount importance. Apart from the routine clinical and biological investigations, three aspects have been relatively neglected by the transplant community and may require a careful analysis in elderly candidates to transplantation: the presence and degree of frailty, the presence of comorbidities and the adherence to prescriptions. Although there are rapid and simple tests for assessing the degree of frailty in the elderly, there is no clear cut-off value to decide whether a patient should be accepted or not. With advanced age the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular events and other diseases tend to increase. The use of combined age-comorbidity indices may be helpful to identify patients at high risk of mortality. Another critical point is the poor unintentional adherence to treatment, often caused by forgetfulness and mild cognitive impairment. These drawbacks may be further enhanced by a high number of pills to take and by changes in the dosage or type of prescriptions. A careful screening of the presence and degree of frailty, comorbidity and poor compliance to treatment is highly recommended before admitting older candidates to the waiting list for transplantation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction: Frailty is prevalent among ESRD patients and is associated with higher rates of death and hospitalization following kidney transplantation. It is unknown the burden of frailty among patients waitlisted for kidney transplantation, and whether frail patients on the waiting list have a higher risk of mortality compared to non-frail patients. Methods: The ACTIVE/ADIPOSE study is a prospective, multi-center, United States Renal Data System cohort study measuring frailty among ESRD patients. Baseline data on the Fried Frailty Index (non-frail, pre-frail, or frail) and Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) physical function (PF) score were collected among 771 participants from 2009-2011. Logistic regression models examined the associations between frailty and mortality. Results: Among 771 study participants, 303 (39.3%) were waitlisted and examined. Among waitlisted patients, 56.3% of patients were pre-frail, and 8.0% were frail based on the Fried Frailty Index. More than half (56.2%) were slow/weak as measured by PF score, and 37.5% self-reported poor endurance/exhaustion (Vitality). A total of 27 (9.2%) of patients died after being listed for transplant, including 3.8% of non-frail, 9.6% of pre-frail, and 29.2% of frail patients (p=0.0005). Among waitlisted patients, ESRD patients who were pre-frail and frail were 2.5 times (OR=2.69; 95% CI: 0.88-8.29) and 10.4 times (OR=10.40; 95% CI: 2.74-39.38) more likely to die, respectively, vs. non-frail patients (p<0.005). Patients with low physical functioning (PF < 75) had higher odds of death vs. those with adequate PF (OR=3.73; 95% CI: 1.37-10.15). Age-adjusted models showed similar effects, suggesting frailty is an independent risk factor for mortality among ESRD patients. Conclusion: Frailty and pre-frailty may be an important indicator of mortality among ESRD patients waiting for a kidney transplant. Whether frailty among waitlisted patients predicts post-transplant outcomes is unknown and requires further exploration. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction: Frailty is common among ESRD patients and is associated with adverse outcomes, including death and hospitalization. While frailty is associated with delayed graft function and hospitalization following kidney transplantation, it is unknown how frailty impacts transplant access. Methods: The ACTIVE/ADIPOSE study is a prospective, multi-center, United States Renal Data System cohort study measuring frailty among ESRD patients. Baseline data on the Fried Frailty Index (non-frail, pre-frail, or frail), Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) physical function (PF) score, and Vitality score (endurance/exhaustion) were collected among 771 participants from 2009-2011. Logistic regression models examined the associations between frailty, PF, and vitality and 1) waitlisting and 2) transplant access. Results: Among 771 participants, a total of 58.2% of patients were pre-frail and 14.0% were frail. Nearly two-thirds (65.0%) were classified as slow/weak (PF) and 38.7% self-reported poor endurance/exhaustion (Vitality). A total of 303 (39.3%) patients were waitlisted, including 166 pre-frail and 24 frail patients. ESRD patients who were pre-frail and frail were 40% (OR=0.60; 95% CI: 0.43-0.84) and 71% (OR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.17-0.49) less likely to waitlist, respectively, vs. non-frail patients (p<0.0001). Patients who had low physical functioning (PF < 75) had lower odds of waitlisting vs. those with adequate PF (OR=0.55; 95% CI: 0.40-0.75). There was no association between vitality and waitlist access. While follow-up is only 2 years, 36 patients (4.9%) were transplanted in the cohort, including 20 pre-frail and 1 frail patient. Frail patients were 88% less likely to be transplanted (OR=0.12; 95% CI: 0.02-0.95) vs. non-frail patients. Age-adjusted models showed similar effects. Conclusion: Pre-frail and frail patients comprised nearly two-thirds of waitlisted patients in the ACTIVE/ADIPOSE study. Frail patients and patients with poor physical function have reduced access to kidney transplantation, although whether this is beneficial or detrimental is unknown.

N2  - Background: Frailty prevalence is high and predicts mortality and graft loss in adults of all ages undergoing kidney transplantation (KT). The goal of this work was to understand what happens to frailty scores after KT. Methods: 184 KT recipients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study (December 2008 and August 2013) at the time of transplantation and followed after KT. The Fried frailty score was measured at the time of transplantation and during routine clinical follow-up. The predictors of changes in frailty score were identified using modified Poisson regression. Results: At the time of transplantation, 22.3% of all KT recipients were frail. On average, frailty scores got worse at 1 month (mean change=0.27, P=0.06), were no different than pre-transplantation at 2 months (mean change=0.07, P=0.62) and then improved by 3 months post-KT (mean change=-0.33, P=0.02). The percent of KT recipients who were frail increased from 22.3% at the time of KT to 30.7% at 1 month and subsequently decreased to 12.5% at 3 months. In a multivariate model, patient factors associated with a decrease in frailty score were being frail at the time of KT (HR=3.30, 95% CI: 1.91-5.66, P<0.001) and being a female recipient (HR=2.04, 95% CI: 1.20-3.47, P=0.008). Conclusions: After transplantation, frailty worsens by one month but improves by three months for adults of all ages. Improvement in frailty score may be greater in women and in those who were frail at the time of transplantation. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is a predictor of poor outcomes after transplantation. However, frailty is not routinely measured, and providers instead rely on perceptions of physiologic reserve to assess overall patient health status and guide clinical decisions. Thus, we sought to explore the agreement between measured frailty and provider perceptions of frailty. Methods: We measured frailty in prevalent dialysis patients from a single hemodialysis center based on five components (exhaustion, weakness, low physical activity, weight loss, and slow gait speed) and categorized frailty scores as nonfrail, prefrail, and frail according to the Fried index. We also asked providers (nephrologists and nurse practitioners (NPs)) to estimate whether they would expect their patient to be nonfrail, prefrail, and frail. Weighted kappa was used to determine agreement, and ordinal logistic regression was used to identify correlates. Results: Of 126 study participants, mean age was 60.5 years (SD 13.6), 46.2% were female, 84.1% were African American, median time on dialysis was 3.6 years (IQR 1.43-6.12), mean BMI was 28.6 (SD 8.0), and 31.1% were measured as frail. Nephrologist perceptions agreed poorly with measured frailty (weighted kappa, 0.12), while NP perceptions were borderline fair in agreement (weighted kappa, 0.21). Nephrologists rated 42.1% of nonfrail patients as frail or prefrail (overestimation) and 41.5% of frail/prefrail patients as nonfrail (underestimation). NPs overestimated the frailty of 36.1% of nonfrail patients and underestimated the frailty of 23.1% of frail/prefrail patients. Adjusting for race, gender, time on dialysis, BMI, and measured frailty, nephrologists were more likely to misclassify older patients as frail (aOR 1.08, p<0.001); NPs were more likely to misclassify older (aOR 1.03, p=0.04), female (aOR 2.27, p=0.049), and non-African American (aOR 4.60, p=0.01) patients as frail. Conclusions: Provider perceptions of frailty are discordant with measured frailty and may be biased by non-modifiable patient characteristics. Since perceptions of frailty likely reflect overall impressions of patient health status, efforts to standardize the measurement of frailty in the clinical setting and to dispel misconceptions about the predictors of frailty might improve the clinical decision making process.

N2  - Background: MMF dose reduction or discontinuation predicts poor KT outcomes including rejection, graft loss and death. However, little is known about which patients are at risk of MMF intolerance. Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, is emerging as an important predictor in kidney transplantation (KT) recipients of all ages, including early hospital readmission, delayed graft function, graft loss and mortality. We hypothesized that frailty, given its association with an inflammatory phenotype, might also predict MMF immunosuppression tolerance. Methods: We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed) in KT recipients at admission for KT. Frailty and MMF dose was available for 535 KT recipients. MMF intolerance (MMF dose reduction <2000 mg/day) was identified from electronic medical records. The risk of MMF intolerance by frailty status was quantified using Cox proportional hazards model that censored for death and adjusted for multiple recipient, donor, and transplant factors. Results: 46% of recipients were non-frail (0 or 1 component), 32% were intermediately frail (2 components), and 22% were frail at KT (3 or more components). The mean follow-up time was 1.5 years [IQR: 0.4-2.3 years] and 52.9% of recipients had an MMF reduction. Compared to those who were non-frail, intermediately or frail recipients were at 35% higher risk of MMF immunosuppression intolerance (adjusted hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06-1.71). The association of frailty and MMF immunosuppression intolerance did not differ by recipient age (P for interaction=0.8). Conclusion: Intermediately frail and frail KT recipients are at increased risk of MMF immunosuppression intolerance. It is possible that this intolerance partially explains why these recipients are at increased risk of poor KT outcomes such as graft loss and mortality. A better understanding of which patients might not tolerate MMF is helpful in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression.

N2  - Background and Methods: We aimed to compare functional status in men and women on the liver transplant (LT) wait-list. Consecutive adult outpatients (n=340) listed for LT at one center (96% recruitment rate) underwent 4 frailty/functional impairment assessments at a single time point: Fried Frailty, gait speed, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), and Instrumental ADL (IADL) scales. Chi-square and Kruskal-wallis tests compared differences by gender. Using competing risks models, we assessed the association between the Fried Frailty Instrument and wait-list mortality (death/delisting for being too sick for LT) given its validity and prognostic utility in other non-elderly populations. Results: Of 340 LT candidates, 33% were women. Men and women were similar by median follow up (11 vs 10mo), age (60 vs 60yr), body mass index (29 vs 28), %ascites (34 vs 36), %encephalopathy (17 vs 19) [p>0.05], but differed by %HCC (31 vs 18), %hypertension (48 vs 36), bilirubin (2.2 vs 2.6 mg/dL), creatinine (1.0 vs 0.9 mg/dL), %on dialysis (3 vs 7), MELD [15 (IQR 12-18) vs 15 (13-19)] [p<0.05 for each]. Women displayed higher rates of functional impairment (Table). (Table Presented) Wait-list mortality occurred in 20% frail and 10% not frail candidates (p=0.046). Death/delisting occurred in 9% of non-frail women, 9% of frail women, 11% of non-frail men, but 27% of frail men (p=0.03). Compared to non-frail women, frail men had a 3.4 fold increased risk of wait-list mortality (Figure). Conclusions: Among LT candidates, women display higher rates of functional impairment than men. Frailty is a stronger predictor of wait-list mortality in men, independent of MELD score.

N2  - Background: Recent trials showed efficacy of bendamustine plus rituximab compared to gold standard therapy in Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Aims: In our study the objective is to confirm also the less toxicity and consequentely the improved quality of life of this alkylating agent in frail patients. Methods: : In our institution from 2011 to 2013 we treated with bendamustine 33 Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma(NHL) patients, performance status 1-3, (25 indolent, 8 aggressive) with age > 65 years (29 patients relapse/refractory ) and while 4 first line patients<65 with severe dilatative cardiopathy. Of 33 patients (13 female and 20 male) the median age was 70 (range 52-88) and 14 (42%) patients were older than 75 years of age. Bendamustine was administered intravenous (minimum 70-maximum 90mg/m2/day) for 2 consecutive days in combination with rituximab 375mg/m2 for 1 day every 28-days cycle for a minimum of 4 courses to a maximum of 8, for a total of 156 courses. The patients comorbidities were:hepatopathy HCV/HBV correlated,hypertensive or ischemic or dilatative cardiopathy , chronic bronchitis, diabetes, chronic renal impairment without dialysis.We admistred routinely primary prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support and antimicrobic therapy. Results: At a median of 12 months' follow-up, 25 patients were evaluable for efficacy and safety. The overall response rate at that time was 90%, with 57% complete responses, 30% partial response, 12% stable disease and 3%early death (1 patients 77 yrs old, died in neutropenic fever after 2st cycle for staphylococcus haemoliticus sepsi) Adverse events were : in 31 patients (94%) prophylactic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) reduced to grade 1neutropenia without infectious complications or therapy delayed or dose reductions applied, while cytopenias grade 4 occurred in 2 patients (6%)reverible with G-CSF and supported with red cell and platelet transfusions ;the fever infections that requiring IV antiobiotics were in 2 patients(6%)in particular 1 patients presented an E.Coli pneumonia and the other patient a staphylococcus haemoliticus sepsi;skin allergic toxicities as rash and pruritus in 3 patients (9%) of which in 2 reversible stopping concomitant cotrimoxazole and allopurinol (grade 1)and 1 patient urticaria (grade 2) treated with short and low doses steroid therapy, gastrointestinal toxicity as nausea, vomiting in 1 patients (3%) grade 2 corrected only with antiemetic medical treatment. In our updated analysis, no cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, secondary neoplasms or medically interaction with several drug taken by elderly patients,had been observed Summary and Conclusions: The quality of life assessment questionnaire proposed to the patients showed willingly acceptance of this medical treatment without changing life personal routine. Frail NHL patients (elderly or severe comorbidities) who would not be suitable to receive intensive chemotherapies and might be at increased risk of toxicities could benefit of bendamustine plus rituximab combination.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide is rising markedly becoming a priority public health problem. The progression of CKD cause functional limitation and severe disability with poor quality of life. The aim of present review was to highlight the effect of rehabilitation in CKD and ESRD subjects. The rehabilitative process is unique in treating disabled people according to a holistic approach with the aim of supporting a person's independent living and autonomy. CKD are associated with an increased risk of functional impairment, independent of age, gender, and co-morbidities. Clinicians should counsel patients with CKD including frail elder people to increase physical activity levels and target that regular physical activity including aerobic or endurance exercises training benefits health. In old subjects with CKD and multiple functional impairments, the traditional disease based model should be changed to individualized patient-centered approach that prioritizes patient preferences. Patients receiving haemodialysis have a considerably lower exercise tolerance, functional capacity, and more muscle wasting than healthy subjects or patients with less severe CKD. Exercise training or comprehensive multi-dimensional strategy and goal-oriented intervention should be also provided in ESRD older subjects. Structured prevention programs based on reducing the risk factors for CKD and rehabilitative strategies could reduce disability occurrence.

N2  - Frailty in the elderly is a state of vulnerability to poor resolution of homoeostasis after a stressor event and is a consequence of cumulative decline in many physiological systems during a lifetime. This cumulative decline depletes homoeostatic reserves until minor stressor events trigger disproportionate changes in health status. It is usually associated to adverse health outcomes and to one-year mortality risk. Physical exercise has found to be effective in preventing frailty and disability in this population. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also a clinical condition where protein energy-wasting, sarcopenia and dynapenia ,very common symptoms in the frail elderly, may occur. Moreover elderly and CKD patients are both affected by an impaired physical performance that may be reversed by physical exercise with an improvement of the survival rate. These similarities suggest that frailty may be a common pathway of aging and CKD that may induce disability and that can be prevented by a multidimensional approach in which physical exercise plays an important role.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Infection represent a significant determinant of mortality in patients with ESRD, in particular in children. Infection is also a frequent cause of hospitalization in these patients, showing a sharp increase in admission rate in the last decade. Factors leading to increased risk for infection include immune dysfunction, young or advanced age, vascular access devices and immunosuppression. However, studies reporting the burden of severe infection on children on RRT surviving until adult age are lacking. Therefore, aim of our analysis was to evaluate changes in infection-related hospitalization rate between 1980-2010 and differences between infection and non-infection admissions in patients on RRT. Methods: The study cohort comprised all Dutch patients (n. 234) who had started chronic RRT at < 15 years of age between 1972 and 1992, and who were born before 1979 and alive in 1980.We analyzed data on hospital admission and infection-related hospitalizations from 1980 to 2010. The Hospital Admission Rate (HAR) was expressed as the number of admissions per 100 patient-years ( py). The Hospital Admission Rate Ratios (HARRs) were calculated to compare infection and non-infection-related hospitalizations. Poisson regression models were used to examine the trends in infection and non-infection HAR. Results: Infection-related HAR on HD were higher between 1980 and 1989 (27.33/100 py, 26.78-27.88, p < 0.0001) but did not show significant changes between 90's (17.89/ 100 py, 17.42-18.38) compared to 2000-2010 (13.97/100 py, 13.49-14.47). Equally infection-related hospitalizations on PD were significantly higher only in 80's (69.2/100 py, 67.54-70.89) compared to the last decade (29.45/100 py, 28.42-30.51). On the other hand, it is noteworthy that Transplantation (Tx) admissions did not change throughout the study period with an almost constant HAR from 11.86/100 py (11.66-12.06) in 80's to 9.89/100 py (9.74-10.05) in 90's and 9.92 (9.75-10.08) in 2000's. The overall HARR was significantly higher both in 80's (0.32, 95% CI 0.28-0.37) and 90's (0.42, 0.36-0.49) compared to 2000's (0.73, 0.61-0.88). This increasing trend was no evident in admissions while on HD or PD, whereas admissions on Tx showed a marked increase in infection/non-infection ratio from 0.25 (0.2-0.3) between 1980-1989, to 0.50 (0.41-0.6) between 1990-1999 up to 1 (0.79-1.27) in the last decade. Conclusions: In conclusion, in our RRT cohort, infection-related HAR showed only a limited decrease in the last three decades, despite the overall significant decrease in all-cause rate. The burden of severe infections on long-termRRT patients is heavier in the last ten years compared to the previous two decades, in particular for patients on Tx. A special attention should be paid to infections risk factors, as immunosuppression, recurrent peritonitis and central venous catheter, to prevent repeated hospitalizations and mortality in this class of particularly frail patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Haemodialysis (HD) is the most common dialysis modality for frail older patients although many tolerate this poorly and have transport problems. Assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) is increasingly available to enable home treatment. There is no data about patient outcomes on aPD compared to HD. This study has been designed in 2 parts. Part 1 is a cross-sectional study obtaining a snapshot view of patient well-being on aPD compared to HD. Part 2 is a prospective longitudinal study determining patient outcomes over 2 years. This report focuses on the results of Part 1. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Comparison of quality of life and physical function of prevalent frail older patients on aPD and HD Methods: aPD patients (defined as requiring assistance to perform PD by paid or unpaid carer) and HD patients (requiring hospital transport) were recruited from 11 centres. All were ≥60 years, on dialysis for ≥3 months and free from hospitalisation for 30 days. The HD eligible patients were matched to recruited aPD participants by age (±3 years), sex, diabetes status, time on dialysis (± 2 years), ethnicity and Index of Deprivation. Quality of life assessments were made using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), SF-12, Palliative Outcome Symptom Scale and Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale. Physical function was assessed by Barthel score (measure of aids to daily living) and Timed Up and Go. Results: 54 aPD and 52 matched HD patients were studied. Mean age was 74.1 ± 7.5 and 72.7 ± 7.8 years respectively; presence of frailty was similar between both modalities (57.4% on aPD and in 42.3% on HD). Multivariate analyses with p-values derived from a generalised linear model showed that frailty score was the most influential variable in relation to outcomes: SF 12 physical p=0.002; SF 12 mental p=0.03; Barthel p<0.0001; Timed Up and Go p<0.0001. Dialysis modality was the most influential variable in determining the total HADS score (mean aPD 12.6, HD 9.5, p=0.0472) and symptom score (median aPD 17, HD 13.5, p=0.023). Using a propensity score derived from age, gender, frailty and comorbidity scores to compare pairs of participants on aPD and HD, showed that the significantly higher HADS score on aPD (P=0.03) remained but not the symptom score (P=0.37). Probable depression (HADS >8) was also more common in the aPD group (p=0.0442). Conclusions: Degree of frailty is the major determinant of quality of life and physical function. Dialysis modality has a minor role with probably slightly more depression in the aPD group but this needs confirming in the larger longitudinal study. Both aPD and HD should therefore be discussed as potential modalities leaving choice to individual patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Patients with chronic kidney disease experience poorer outcomes compared with the general population. While epidemiological findings are available on mortality related to kidney transplant and dialysis, evidence on mortality attributable to chronic kidney disease is lacking.We analyzed the excess mortality related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) by taking into account the expected mortality of the general population, using a relative survival model. Subsequently, we modelled the excess mortality rate found in CKD patients using a flexible parametric survival analysis. Methods:We applied the excess mortality rate to a cohort of 9692 patients who entered the Prevention of Progressive Renal Insufficiency Project (PIRP) registry between 2006 and 2010 in Emilia-Romagna, a North-Eastern Italian region with about 4.3 million inhabitants, of whom 23% are aged 65 or more. The PIRP registry collects clinical data on CKD patients who receive an individualized pharmacological and dietary treatment aimed to reduce CKD progression. Matching with the general population mortality was made using the mortality tables of the Emilia-Romagna region by calendar year, gender and age for the years 2006-2010. Patients were followed until the event of death or the end of the study. Relative survival allows to estimate the difference in survival rates due specifically to CKD. Results: Overall 5-years estimate of survival rate was 66.8% in the PIRP patients cohort (Fig.1) and that expected from the general population was 78.8%, with an estimated (Figure presented) 15.2% decrease in the survival rate of CKD patients (relative survival ratio=RSR=0.848). Survival had a similar trend for each underlying nephropathy (nephroangiosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephrites and polycystic kidney disease) over the five years of observation. Factors significantly associated with excess mortality attributable to CKD per se were CKD stage (Excess Mortality Rate Ratio=EMRR=6.4 for stage 4 and EMRR=14.5 for stage 5 compared with stage 3a), being underweight (EMRR=2.53 compared with normal BMI), previous cardiovascular events (EMRR=2.41), older age (EMRR=2.61 for 60-69 years, EMRR=3.5 for 70-79 years, EMRR=5.07 for >79 years compared with <50 years), and diabetes (EMRR=1.36). Conclusions: Relative survival is a method only recently applied in the nephrology field; it may be evaluated on CKD cohorts, for the chronic nature of the disease. Our findings further underline that CKD patients are a particularly frail population; at each stage of disease and even at older ages they have an excess of mortality on the overall population. Because the large majority of patients are in the CKD stages 3 and 4, our results provide additional useful information for primary care physicians and nephrologists about factors to be monitored to decrease the risk of death from the onset of the disease onwards.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Frailty is very common concerns in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, which is associated with disability, hospitalization and mortality. However, there is only few study reporting the relation between frailty and physical performance function in this population. Methods: This ongoing study has recruited ambulatory MHD patients aged ≥20 years (y) old on MHD ≥6 months, without hospitalization history for the previous 3 months.We adopted frailty phenotype composed of the following components; 1) unintentional weight loss more than 4.5 Kg or 5% of the previous body weight for the last 1 year, 2) physical inactivity, 3) RAND-36 physical function (PF) scale <75 and vitality (VT) scale <55 as surrogates for weakness/slowness and exhaustion, respectively. Low PF scale was scored as 2 points and other components as 1 point for each. Those with 3 or more points were considered as “frail”. Short physical performance battery (SPPB), sit to stand test (STS30, the number of sit to stand cycles completed for 30 seconds), 6 minute walk (6MWT, distance in meters measured for 6 minutes) and timed up and go (TUG, seconds) tests were measured the day after hemodialysis treatment. Demographic and laboratory data were obtained by review of medical records. Results: Sixty three patients evaluated were 57.5±11.6 years of age (mean±SD) on MHD for 5.2±5.4 years (y); 49.2% were male. Frail patients was 28.6% (18/63), who were more likely to be older (64.4±10.4 vs. 54.8±10.9 y; P<0.05), diabetes (DM) (72.2 vs. 44.4%; P<0.05), have higher Charlson-Comorbidity Index (CCI) (6.9±1.9 vs. 5.0 ±2.1; P<0.001) and lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level (ng/ml) (9.6±4.9 vs. 13.4±8.5; P<0.05). Frailty was significantly associated with lower SPPB scores (10.2±1.4 vs. 11.4±1.0; P<0.001), lower STS30 (14.3±3.9 vs. 19.5±5.4; P<0.001), lower 6MWT (377.9±92.2 vs. 493.7±76.3; P<0.001) and longer TUG (s) (8.9±1.7 vs. 6.8±1.7; P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, SPPB, STS30, 6MWT and TUG showed significant associations (odds ratio [95% CI]: 0.45 [0.23-0.86], 0.75 [0.61-0.93], 0.99 [0.98-0.99] and 1.67 [1.08-2.59], respectively) with frailty, after adjustment for age, gender, DM, CCI, levels of hemoglobin, albumin and 25OHD. Conclusions: Frailty is very common even in relatively stable MHD patients. Frailty phenotype is useful to reflect impaired physical performance function in MHD population.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) is now more available as an alternative to hospital haemodialysis (HD) for frail older patients but the lack of outcome data comparing HD with aPD has limited its use. FEPOD part 1 reported no significant difference in the primary outcomes of quality of life and physical functioning, except for higher prevalence of possible depression in the aPD group. This report describes the secondary outcomes for the study group. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Hospitalisation, falls, symptom burden, cognition and patient satisfaction. Methods: aPD patients and HD patients were recruited from 11 centres. The HD patients were matched to recruited aPD participants by age, sex, diabetes status, time on dialysis, ethnicity and Index of Deprivation. The MiniMental State Examination (MMSE) and the Trail Making Form B were used to assess global cognitive function and executive function respectively. Falls and symptom burden were assessed using a falls questionnaire and the Palliative Outcome Symptom scale (renal) respectively. Patient satisfaction was measured using the Renal Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Results: 106 patients (52 HD; 54 aPD) were recruited. 35 % of the study group had at least one hospital admission in the preceding three months. 42% of all admissions were dialysis related. 28% of the study group had at least one fall in the preceding three months.83.3% of them occurred at home, with the HD group sustaining more fractures than the aPD group (26.7% HD vs. 6.7% aPD, p=0.329). Lethargy, pain and poor mobility were predominant in the study group. The median number of reported symptoms were 9 (IQR 7 - 11) in the HD group and 10 (IQR 7.75 to 13) in the aPD group. 42.3% of HD patients reported no improvement in symptoms since starting dialysis, as against 25.9% of the aPD group. 10.5% of the study group had abnormalMMSE scores (<24). There was no statistical difference inMMSE scores between HD patients and aPD patients [mean MMSE - 27 (HD), 28 (aPD), p=0.120]. In contrast, 36.8% had executive dysfunction (trail making B test time > 300 seconds). Executive dysfunction was more prevalent in the aPD group [54.2% aPD vs. 27.7% HD, (p = 0.089)]. Despite the above outcomes, 91.5% of the study group would recommend their therapy to others (mean total renal treatment satisfaction scores - 49.6 HD vs. 50.3 aPD, p=0.722). Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of falls, symptom burden, executive dysfunction and hospitalisation in frail elderly dialysis patients, irrespective of dialysis modality. This should be considered during discussions about renal replacement modalities (including non-dialytic care). FEPOD part 2, the longitudinal phase of the study, will provide information on the influence of dialysis modality on the trajectory of these outcomes.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The number of frail and old kidney patients is growing. Therefore, European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) is establishing guidance for CKD management in frail and elderly in collaboration with the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS). This project aimed to identify what topics are considered high priority by clinicians in order to ensure the guidance's relevance for clinical practice. Methods: Figure 1 shows the entire scoping process. Main steps were: a literature review, a survey among 563 European clinicians, and a face-to-face consensus meeting with experts from nephrology and geriatrics. Using Nominal Group Technique, the meeting comprised two rounds. In Round 1 experts individually and anonymously rated each topic on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (critically important). A moderator then summarised the individual ratings and discussed this with the group. In Round 2 experts had the opportunity to revise their original ratings in the light of the group discussion. The priorities assigned in this last round formed input for the final topic selection.We defined 'consensus' on a topic's priority as all ratings in a round falling within a 3-point range. Results: The literature review together with suggestions from experts and European clinicians resulted in a list of 46 topics to be potentially addressed in guidance for CKD management in frail and older patients. When rating this list during the consensus meeting the experts reached consensus on the importance of 3 topics in the Round 1. This number increased to 11 in Round 2, and included all top 5 high priority topics (Table 1). The ERBP guideline development group is currently considering all top 5 topics for inclusion in the guidance scope. Which type of guidance is most suitable will depend on whether the topic is already covered by other guideline organisations, as well as on expected availability of randomised studies. Conclusions: Our scoping procedure allowed clinicians from all over Europe to (Figure presented) contribute to determining the scope of renal guidance. It also increased expert consensus on what topics were most important for being finally selected. Lastly, it enabled us to identify what topics had the highest priority regarding CKD management in frail and older patients. The next step will be for ERBP to develop appropriate guidance for each of these topics, while taking into account existing guidance produced by other organisations.

N2  - Objective: We compare clinical outcome of upper J-hemisternotomy (JHS) with full sternotomy (FS) in elective isolated aortic valve patients. Methods: Between January, 2007, and January, 2012, a total of 505 patients underwent isolated aortic valve surgery using a pericardial bioprosthesis. Ninety patients were operated via upper JHS and 415 via FS. Perioperative outcome was compared between groups. Data presented as meanTSEM. Results: There was no difference in age, body mass index, gradient, EF and NYHA classes between JHS and FS patients. Logistic EuroSCORE was 7.5±2.7 vs. 7.4±4.1 (n.s.). Operative data showed that 75% vs. 72% of patients received a bioprosthesis of size #23 or #25. ACC (64±19min vs. 56±15min) and ECC (79±22min vs. 76±20min) were slightly higher in JHS compared to FS (n.s.). Operative mortality was 0% in both; 30d mortality was 2.7 % vs. 3.4% (n.s.). Postoperative complications (de novo) were as follows: myocardial infarction 0.9%vs. 0.5%, deep sternal infection 0.9%vs. 0.8%, stroke 0.9% vs. 1.9% (all n.s.), transient neurologic deficit 6.3% vs. 11.1% ( p<0.05), prolonged ventilation 4.5% vs. 8.2% ( p<0.05), renal failure and dialysis 1.8% vs. 3.9% (p<0.05), and atrial fibrillation 17.1% vs. 33.8% (p<0.05) in JHS vs. FS. Conclusions: In patients with comparable EuroSCORE JHS can be performed safely as compared to FS. Postoperative ventilation was significantly prolonged and the incidences of transient neurologic deficits, renal complications and atrial fibrillation were significantly higher in patients with FS. In the advent of sutureless valves JHS may be a valuable approach for increasingly frail patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The number of frail and older patients on dialysis in Europe is growing. In this population, the benefits of dialysis are often questionable, which may result in a dilemma for clinicians and patients on whether to continue or withdraw dialysis. This ERBP initiated study explored how nephrologists in Europe perceive several factors that are potentially associated with this decision. Methods: An electronic, 36-item survey among ERA-EDTA members disseminated via an e-mail blast. Results: In total, 514 nephrologists from45 European countries completed the survey. Themajority were >50 years old (52%), and worked in a university centre (53%); 48% had been practising >20 years; 49% spent >75% of their time in direct patient care.More than half (58%) estimated that in the last year withdrawals had occurred in <1% of their patients. Laws and Regulations: Of all respondents, 79% felt that dialysis withdrawal was at least informally permitted in their country, of which 43% were aware of a legal basis. Figure 1 shows that respondents who perceived withdrawal as (in)formally permitted more often reported the estimated occurrence of withdrawals to be at least 1% in the last year compared to those who felt withdrawal was not permitted in their country (45 vs. 27%; P < .05). Patients' Reasons (NOT) toWithdraw: The majority (80%) believed that their patients withdrew from dialysis primarily due to an imbalance between treatment burden and expected survival benefit. Perceived patients' reasons for refraining from withdrawal were: fearing a lack of adequate further medical support (35%); lack of social support at home (28%); lack of suitable palliative care facilities (27%). Organisation of Palliative Care: 26% of respondents answered that after withdrawal patients were mostly referred directly home, without a hospital admission preparing them for the new situation; 17% reported specialised palliative care hospices as a common destination for withdrawn patients. A minority of participants were aware of local protocols on when/how to discuss withdrawal (7%), or on how to organise palliative care (12%). Palliative Care Education: The majority of nephrologists stated that palliative care had not been part of their core curriculum (74%), and that they did not attend any CME session on the topic in the last 3 years (74%). Main reasons for the latter were that such sessions were not organised (70%), and that respondents perceived other topics as more important (32%). Conclusions: Our study shows that -despite lack of (awareness of ) a legal basis- the attitude towards withdrawing dialysis in countries is often perceived as 'permissive'. Yet, more than half of respondents estimated withdrawal to occur in <1% of patients. Our results suggest that there is room for improvement regarding protocolisation of (care after) dialysis withdrawal. Also, better access to specialised facilities, and increasing rates of palliative care education amongst practising nephrologists might make it easier for patients to opt for withdrawal.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is common in hemodialysis patients and is a powerful predictor of adverse outcomes. The aims of this randomized controlled trial were to investigate the effects of a six-month intradialytic physical activity program in addition to an adapted nutritional support on protein-energy wasting (PEW), physical functioning and quality of life in chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods: All 210 patients of 2 dialysis units in Nantes (France) were screened for the presence of PEW according to the criteria of the ISRNM. Eligible patients were then randomly assigned either to a nutrition and exercise group (N+EX) or to a nutrition only group (N). In both groups, the prescription of nutritional supplements (oral or, in case of intolerance, IV) was adapted according to the dietary records, in order to reach goals set by the European Guidelines for Nutrition in terms of protein and energy intake. In addition, N+EX group engaged in a 6-months progressive submaximal intradialytic cycling exercise program. Primary outcome was to compare the number of patients having reached remission of PEW in N+EX vs. N group by 6 months. Secondary outcomes assessed the effects of intradialytic exercise on functional performances (six-minute walk test (6MWT), quiet standing postural control, and maximal quadriceps strength), body composition (estimated by bio-impedance spectroscopy) and self-reported health-related quality of life (SF-36 score). Results: Twenty-one eligible patients (11 men) consented to participate and were randomized: 11 N vs. 10 N+EX. Mean age and dialysis vintage (years) were: 71.0 (range 52-89) and 8.6 (0.8-23.8) in N+EX, and 69.9 (51-93), 11.3 (1.3-25.7) in N respectively. Six patients in N+EX and nine patients in N completed the 6 months of the study. Causes of drop-out were: kidney transplantation (1 N+EX), death due to comorbidities (1 N, 1N+EX), intercurrent disease (2 N+EX) and withdrawal of consent (1 N). No serious adverse effects directly related to exercise occurred. There was no significant difference in the number of patients having reached remission of PEW between the two groups. Two of 6 patients in N+EX and 4 of 9 patients in N had no longer all criteria of PEW, but only one patient in N had normal albumin, prealbumin and LTI at the end of the study. No significant changes were observed between groups over time in measures of serum-albumin, -prealbumin, C-reactive protein, body mass index, lean- and fat-tissue index or quadriceps force. There were statistically significant and clinical meaningful increases in self- assessed quality of life (SF36 mean score +61%) and in the 6MWT (+ 42%) in N+Ex while these parameters declined in N. The postural control (assessed by the quantity of postural sway) worsened over time in N and remained stable in N+EX. Conclusions: The results of this study, made in a limited number of patients, could not show an additive effect of combining intradialytic exercise and nutritional support in the treatment of PEW. However this strategy seems safe, well accepted and increases significantly physical performances and quality of life in this frail population of dialysis patients. Further larger-scale studies are necessary in order to investigate long term clinical outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although individuals with kidney disease, including those dependent on dialysis, often present clinically with signs and symptoms consistent with frailty, there is limited information about sociodemographic and clinical risk factors that may be associated. METHODS: Seven hundred forty-five patients undergoing hemodialysisbetween 2009 and 2011 in 7 Atlanta dialysis clinics and 7 San Francisco bay area dialysis clinics were assessed using the validated Fried frailty index (recent unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk speed, low physical activity) that defines frailty as the presence of 3 or more criteria. Study coordinators interviewed participants; measured grip strength, walk speed, and body composition; and reviewed records for clinical and laboratory parameters. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of patient characteristics with frailty. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, peripheral vascular disease and cardiac diseases, including dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, pericarditis, and cardiac arrest, were associated with higher odds for frailty, whereas black race and higher serum albumin concentration were associated with lower odds for frailty. CONCLUSIONS: In multivariable analyses, the risk for frailty in patients undergoing hemodialysis, as assessed by the presence of 3 or more criteria that comprise the Fried frailty index, was increased in association with peripheral vascular disease and cardiac conditions, such as dysrhythmia and atrial fibrillation, and was decreased for those with higher serum albumin concentration and for blacks compared with whites. Among patients who met the Fried definition of frailty, 78% scored as frail on walk speed and 56% scored as frail on grip strength, the 2 physical performance measures.

N2  - Background: In recent years, the End-Stage Kidney Disease population has increased and is ever more frail, elderly and co-morbid. A care-focused approach needs to be incorporated alongside the disease focus, to identify those who are deteriorating and improve communication about preferences and future care. Yet many renal professionals feel unprepared for such discussions. Aim: To develop and pilot a REnal specific Advanced Communication Training (REACT) programme to address the needs of End- Stage Kidney Disease patients and renal professionals. Design: Two-part study: (1) development of the REnal specific Advanced Communication Training programme informed by multiprofessional focus group and patient survey and (2) piloting of the programme. Setting/participants: The REnal specific Advanced Communication Training programme was piloted with 16 participants (9 renal nurses/health-care assistants and 7 renal consultants) in two UK teaching hospitals. Results: The focus group identified the need for better information about end-of-life phase, improved awareness of patient perspectives, skills to manage challenging discussions, 'hands on' practice in a safe environment and follow-up to discuss experiences. The patient survey demonstrated a need to improve communication about concerns, treatment plans and decisions. The developed REnal specific Advanced Communication Training programme was acceptable and feasible and was associated with a non-significant increase in confidence in communicating about end-of-life issues (pre-training: 6.6/10, 95% confidence interval: 5.7-7.4; post-training: 6.9/10, 95% confidence interval: 6.1-7.7, unpaired t-test - p = 0.56), maintained at 3 months. Conclusion: There is a need to improve end-of-life care for End-Stage Kidney Disease patients, to enable them to make informed decisions about future care. Challenges include prioritising communication training among service providers. © The Author(s) 2013.

N2  - Background: Frailty has been proposed as a predictor of postoperative morbidity and mortality in aging vascular surgery population. We developed a frailty-based vascular risk score (VRS) applicable to range of postoperative outcomes and tested it in patients who have undergone peripheral vascular interventions (PVI). Method: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was accessed for 2005-2011 for patients undergone PVI. A 20-item weighted VRS was developed using mean odds ratio across three outcome models. Items include: albumin < 3.4 g/ dl, weight loss (>10% of body weight in 6 months), DM, COPD, pneumonia, CHF, MI, angina, rest pain or gangrene, steroids, bleeding disorder, paraplegia, impaired sensorium, disseminated cancer, dialysis, dyspnea, ascites, and BMI< 18.5 (all have weight =1); non-independent functional status and sepsis (weight = 2). Three outcomes were measured: 1) 30-day mortality, 2) a broad composite (cardiac, renal, clotting, wound, respiratory and surgical complications), and 3) a narrow composite (DVT, re-intubation, prolonged intubation, and return to operating room). Multivariate testing included pre-treatment patient and surgical variables along with VRS. Results: A total of 4,201 cases with PVI were identified. Mean age was 69 yrs. and 39 % were women. Event rate was 2.8% (death), 5.9 % (broad composite), and 12 % (narrow composite). VRS was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 2.11 [1.77-2.51], p<.0001), broad composite (OR 1.65 [1.45-1.88], p<.0001) and narrow composite (OR 1.53 [1.38-1.70], p <.0001). Mortality, broad, and narrow composite event rates increased with each additional risk level. While receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of VRS were better compared to other models including independent functional status, these were not significant. Conclusion: The frailty based VRS was strong and an independent predictor of mortality, broad, and narrow outcomes in patients with PVI. Our simple-to-derive score may aid in defining operative risk in an increasingly aging population.

N2  - Background: Frailty prevalence is high and predicts mortality in adults of all ages undergoing kidney transplantation (KT). The goal of this work was to understand what happens to frailty scores after KT. Methods: 183 KT recipients in Baltimore, Maryland were enrolled in a prospective cohort study (December 2008 and August 2013) at the time of transplantation and followed after KT. The Fried frailty score was measured at the time of transplantation and during routine clinical follow-up. The predictors of regression in frailty score were identified using modified Poisson regression. Results: At the time of transplantation, 22.3% of all KT recipients were frail. On average, frailty scores got worse at 1 month, were no different than pre-transplantation at 2 months and then improved by 3 months post-KT (Figure). During follow-up 37.5% had regression in their frailty score and 37.0% had progression; however, 65.9% of KT recipients who were frail at the time of KT had regression and 19.5% had progression. There were no differences in the rates of regression and progression between older and younger adults (P>0.05). After adjustment for KT factors, female recipients were 1.62-times (95%CI: 1.09-2.43, P<0.001) more likely to experience a regression in their frailty score and those who were frail at the time of KT were 2.37-times (95%CI: 1.64-3.42, P<0.001) more likely to experience a regression; no differences were observed by race or age. Conclusions: After transplantation, frailty gets worse then improves on average by three months for adults of all ages. (Table Presented).

N2  - Background: To quantify the prevalence of frailty in adult kidney transplantation (KT) recipients of all ages, and its association with adverse KT outcomes. Methods: 544 KT recipients were enrolled at the time of KT in a prospective cohort study (12/2008 and 8/2013). Frailty at KT was measured and subsequent KT length of stay (LOS), death-censored graft loss, and mortality were ascertained. The risk of LOS≥3 weeks by frailty was estimated using adjusted modified Poisson regression and the risk of death-censored graft loss and mortality by frailty was estimated using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model; all models were adjusted for recipient, donor, and transplant risk factors. Results: At KT, 21.9% of recipients were frail; 27.8% of older (age≥65) and 20.8% of younger (age<65) were frail, 36.1% and 31.4% were intermediately frail, respectively. Frail recipients had the highest prevalence of LOS≥3 weeks (nonfrail=8.6%, intermediately frail=12.7%, and frail=16.1%). Frailty was independently associated with a 1.80-fold (95%CI:1.03-3.16, P=0.04) increased risk of LOS≥3 weeks. The incidence rate (per 100,000 person-years) of death-censored graft loss was 3.77 for those who were non-frail, 6.51 for those who were intermediately frail and 9.33 for those who were frail. Frailty was independently associated with a 3.03-fold (95%CI:1.16- 7.88, P=0.02) higher risk of death-censored graft loss. The incidence rate (per 100,000 person-years) of mortality was 5.03 for those who were non-frail, 9.11 for those who were intermediately frail and 13.47 for those who were frail. Frailty was independently associated with a 2.35-fold (95%CI:1.04-5.33, P=0.04) higher risk of death. The association of frailty with LOS, death-censored graft loss, and mortality did not differ between older and younger participants (all P for interaction >0.05). Conclusions: KT recipients of all ages have a very high prevalence of frailty, more than 3-fold higher than community dwelling older adults. In this population, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent predictor of LOS, death-censored graft loss, and mortality. (Table presented).

N2  - The sense of taste is an important constituent of the human chemosensory system and a critical component to the overall sense of well-being. Elderly people who are deprived from this pleasant sensory experience can develop depression and a poor quality of life. Drug-induced taste disturbance is a common phenomenon but most often patients and clinicians are unaware of it. Dysgeusia, the misinterpretation of taste, is one of the most common causes of taste disturbance. We present a case of dysgeusia induced by dorzolamide eye drop. A 79-year-old patient was seen in geriatrics clinic for multiple medical problems including advanced bullous emphysema, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, back pain and open angle glaucoma. During one of the clinic visits, he reported that sweet foods tasted bitter. He lost pleasure in eating, and subsequently lost three pounds in one week. His medications included: aspirin, acetaminophen, levothyroxine, omeprazole, thiotropium, mometasone, albuterol and salmeterol inhalers, in addition he was using dorzolamide and brimonidine eye drops for glaucoma and prednisone. On examination he did not have any signs suggestive of upper respiratory tract infection, ear infection, oral cavity disease or neurological problems. Routine laboratory tests including CBC, electrolyte panel and liver functions were unremarkable. The zinc level was 57 mcg/dL. An MRI of the brain revealed chronic small vessel disease. He was started on zinc supplements. His medications were carefully reviewed. Dorzolamide was thought to be a possible etiology of his dysgeusia. This was demonstrated by him regaining normal taste sensation two weeks after discontinuation of the eye drop. Sudden and delayed onset of drug-induced taste disorders have been described with various medications. Similarly, rapid, delayed and non-resolution of dysgeusia after discontinuation of the offending drug have been reported. Our patient was on dorzolamide for sixteen months before the taste change was noted. It is possible that age and the long term use of steroids potentiated this side effect. Our case demonstrates that even a seemingly minor symptom such as dysgeusia can cause weight loss in a short period of time in a frail, elderly patient. Early recognition of dysgeusia associated with dorzolamide therapy prevents long term adverse effects such as failure to thrive.

N2  - MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is a public threat causing skin infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, UTIs, line infections & endocarditis. Not much is known about Staphylococcus induced Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis (PIGN), which is 3 times more common than Strep in elderly. We report a rare morphological variant, IGA-dominant Post-Infectious Glomerulonephritis (APIGN) which only 49 cases have been so far reported. Age is a very important determinant for this variant. An 83 yr-old male with history of CKD-stage 3, ulcerative colitis & recent outpatient treatment for pneumonia was admitted to hospital with progressive dyspnea, productive cough, weight gain & fatigue. He also reported rusty colored urine & phlegm without fever. On exam, he was hypervolemic with rales, raised JVD & leg edema. Labs showed elevated potassium (6.8 mmol/l) with tall 't' waves on EKG that was aggressively treated. His creatinine was raised to 3.8 mg/dL(bsl 1.5-2). UA was positive for 3+ proteinuria, RBC casts & protein-creatinine ratio of 10 (normal-0.2). Due to nephrotic picture, pulse dose steroids was initiated. He also had low complement C3 level, + P-ANCA (from Ulcerative colitis) & negative workup for hemolysis,anti-GBM & ANA. As renal functions didnot improve, hemodialysis was initiated following renal biopsy on day 3 that showed subepithelial & mesangial deposits of IgA & C3 on immunofluroscence consistent with APIGN. He was also treated for Pneumonia with Vancomycin as his sputum grew MRSA. Immunopathogenesis of Staphylococcal PIGN is still unclear. Unlike Strep infection that follows one month post skin infection among children, Staphylococcal PIGN usually occurs with concurrent staph infection of skin or lungs especially in elderly (61% were older than 65yrs per cases reported). Old age & CKD are independent risk factors for the disease and recovery is seen only in less than 25% of the elderly pts including APIGN. Diagnosis is based on low complement, biopsy findings and concurrent staph infection. Management involves treatment of infection & supportive care including transient Dialysis. Until exact pathogenic mechanisms are determined for future targeted intervention, awareness is needed among physicians about this entity in the setting of very common MRSA related sepsis in the frail elderly population.

N2  - Purpose: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces frailty and worsens quality of life (QOL), even in the early stages of the disease and in young patients. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the relationship between frailty and QOL in CKD patients. Thus, we investigated this relationship in a sample of CKD patients. Methods: A cross-observational study was conducted, in which 61 CKD patients receiving pre-dialysis treatment were assessed. All participants completed the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used valid and reliable methods to classify subjects as frail or non-frail according to Johansen's et al. (2007) criteria. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used to compare the groups. In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to measure associations between identified variables and frailty. We also performed simple linear regression using the SF-36 physical and mental composite scores. Results: Almost half of the sample (42.6%) exhibited evidence of frailty. The groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, and all SF-36 domains, excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Frailty was significantly associated with all SF-36 domains, again excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Regression analysis revealed no significant between-group differences in composite physical and mental health scores generated by the SF-36 (p>0.05). Conclusion: Frail and non-frail CKD patients differed significantly in seven of the eight SF-36 domains. The frail group displayed diminished physical and mental functioning when their SF-36 scores were divided by their physical and mental composite scores. Frailty was correlated with QOL domains, with the exception of the social domain. There is a need for interventions targeting the characteristics of frailty, to provide better treatment and optimize overall QOL.

N2  - • A relationship between blood pressure level and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality can be demonstrated by way of a J-curve.The curve's lowest point, the optimal blood pressure, does not appear to be the same for all patients. • The target blood pressure values found in guidelines are partly based on randomised interventional studies in which different target values have been compared. • The general advised target blood pressure is < 140/90 mmHg for patients with cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. For patients with diabetes mellitus the target blood pressure is < 140/85 mmHg. • It has been proven that blood pressure-lowering agents are effective for patients above 80 years who are hypertensive; the target values in these patients are SBP: 140-150 mmHg and DBP: 70-80 mmHg.Lowering the blood pressure in the fragile elderly should be carried out with caution. • In patients with coronary heart disease or diabetes mellitus, the optimal blood pressure for preventing a stroke could be lower than for preventing a myocardial infarction.

N2  - The objective of this article is to review the current and emerging treatments of CKD prior to dialysis in the elderly. Worldwide, there are increasing numbers of people who are aged over 65 years. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of elderly patients presenting with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in the more advanced stages. The elderly have quite different health care needs related to their associated comorbidity, frailty, social isolation, poor functional status, and cognitive decline. Clinical trials assessing treatments for CKD have usually excluded patients older than 70-75 years; therefore, it is difficult to translate current therapies recommended for younger patients with CKD across to the elderly. Many elderly people with CKD progress to end-stage kidney disease and face the dilemma of whether to undertake dialysis or accept a conservative approach supported by palliative care. This places pressure on the patient, their family, and on health care resources. The clinical trajectory of elderly CKD patients has in the past been unclear, but recent evidence suggests that many patients over 75 years of age with multiple comorbidities have greatly reduced life expectancies and quality of life, even if they choose dialysis treatment. Offering a conservative pathway supported by palliative care is a reasonable option for some patients under these circumstances. The elderly person who chooses to have dialysis will frequently have different requirements than younger patients. Kidney transplantation can still result in improved life expectancy and quality of life in the elderly, in carefully selected people. There is a genuine need for the inclusion of the elderly in CKD clinical trials in the future so we can produce evidence-based therapies for this group. In addition, new therapies to treat and slow CKD progression are needed for all age groups. © 2014 Fassett.

N2  - Background Although dialysis prolongs life for patients with end-stage kidney disease, 20% of deaths in this population are preceded by dialysis therapy withdrawal. Recently, there has been more focus on conservative (nondialytic) care as a legitimate option, particularly for elderly patients. This study aims to describe patients' and caregivers' perspectives on conservative treatment and end-of-life care in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Study Design Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Setting & Population Patients with CKD and caregivers. Search Strategy & Sources MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and reference lists were searched to May 2013. Analytical Approach Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the findings. Results 26 studies involving more than 711 patients (non-dialysis dependent [n = 41], hemodialysis [n = 544], peritoneal dialysis [n = 9]; unspecified dialysis modality [n = 31], conservative management [n = 86]) and 178 caregivers were included. We identified 5 themes: invasive suffering (bodily deterioration, loss of freedom and independence, unyielding fatigue and pain, resignation, treatment burden and harm, financial strain), personal vulnerability (imminence of death, misunderstanding and judgment, autonomy and dignity, medical abandonment, trust and safety), relational responsibility (being a burden, demonstrating loyalty, protecting others from grief), negotiating existential tensions (accepting natural course of life, disrupted aging, worthlessness, living on borrowed time, respecting sanctity of life, life satisfaction, preserving self-identity), and preparedness (decisional clarity, informational power, spirituality and hope). Limitations Non-English articles were excluded; therefore, the transferability of findings to other populations is unclear. Conclusions Some patients with CKD experience physical and psychosocial frailty and feel ambivalent about prolonging life. Some caregivers believe in providing relief from suffering, but are uncertain about making decisions regarding dialysis therapy initiation and discontinuation. We suggest that CKD management should encompass palliative care strategies that promote emotional resilience, sense of well-being, and self-value. Also, respectful and attentive communication may empower patients to convey their values and preferences about their own care.

N2  - Background: Although individuals with kidney disease, including those dependent on dialysis, often present clinically with signs and symptoms consistent with frailty, there is limited information about sociodemographic and clinical risk factors that may be associated. Methods: Seven hundred forty-five patients undergoing hemodialysisbetween 2009 and 2011 in 7 Atlanta dialysis clinics and 7 San Francisco bay area dialysis clinics were assessed using the validated Fried frailty index (recent unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk speed, low physical activity) that defines frailty as the presence of 3 or more criteria. Study coordinators interviewed participants; measured grip strength, walk speed, and body composition; and reviewed records for clinical and laboratory parameters. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of patient characteristics with frailty. Results: In adjusted analyses, peripheral vascular disease and cardiac diseases, including dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, pericarditis, and cardiac arrest, were associated with higher odds for frailty, whereas black race and higher serum albumin concentration were associated with lower odds for frailty. Conclusions: In multivariable analyses, the risk for frailty in patients undergoing hemodialysis, as assessed by the presence of 3 or more criteria that comprise the Fried frailty index, was increased in association with peripheral vascular disease and cardiac conditions, such as dysrhythmia and atrial fibrillation, and was decreased for those with higher serum albumin concentration and for blacks compared with whites. Among patients who met the Fried definition of frailty, 78% scored as frail on walk speed and 56% scored as frail on grip strength, the 2 physical performance measures.

N2  - Needing assistance with activities of daily living (ADL) is an early indicator of functional decline and has important implications for individuals' quality of life. However, correlates of need for ADL assistance have received limited attention among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD). A multicenter cohort of 742 prevalent HD patients was assessed in 2009-2011 and classified as frail, prefrail and nonfrail by the Fried frailty index (recent unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk speed, low physical activity). Patients reported need for assistance with 4 ADL tasks and identified contributing symptoms/conditions (pain, balance, endurance, weakness, others). Nearly 1 in 5 patients needed assistance with 1 or more ADL. Multivariable analysis showed increased odds for needing ADL assistance among frail (odds ratio [OR] 11.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.50-23.41; P<0.001) and prefrail (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.01-3.68; P=0.046) compared with non-frail patients. In addition, the odds for needing ADL assistance were lower among blacks compared with whites and were higher among patients with diabetes, lung disease, and stroke. Balance, weakness, and "other" (frequently dialysis-related) symptoms/conditions were the most frequently named reasons for ADL difficulty. In addition to interventions such as increasing physical activity that might delay or reverse the process of frailty, the immediate symptoms/conditions to which individuals attribute their ADL difficulty may have clinical relevance for developing targeted management and/or treatment approaches. © 2013 International Society for Hemodialysis.

N2  - Background: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement. Objective: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis in France. Methods: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network. We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis. Results: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259 (61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and 19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95% CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16 months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition (13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown (18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001), peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P < 0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality. © The Author 2014.

N2  - Today, old age does not represent a formal contraindication to kidney transplantation. Rather, there is evidence that in elderly patients renal transplantation offers longer life expectancy and better quality of life in comparison with dialysis. Yet, the results of renal transplantation in recipients older than 65. years are inferior to those observed in younger adults, death with functioning graft representing a major cause of failure. Therefore, the selection of aged patients is of paramount importance. Apart from the routine clinical and biological investigations, three aspects have been relatively neglected by the transplant community and may require a careful analysis in elderly candidates to transplantation: the presence and degree of frailty, the presence of comorbidities and the adherence to prescriptions. Although there are rapid and simple tests for assessing the degree of frailty in the elderly, there is no clear cut-off value to decide whether a patient should be accepted or not. With advanced age the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular events and other diseases tend to increase. The use of combined age-comorbidity indices may be helpful to identify patients at high risk of mortality. Another critical point is the poor unintentional adherence to treatment, often caused by forgetfulness and mild cognitive impairment. These drawbacks may be further enhanced by a high number of pills to take and by changes in the dosage or type of prescriptions. A careful screening of the presence and degree of frailty, comorbidity and poor compliance to treatment is highly recommended before admitting older candidates to the waiting list for transplantation.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a high prevalence in the elderly population. Almost half of the population reaches moderate impairment (CKD 3) by 65 years of age. This article describes CKD staging in the geriatric population and several common clinical presentations of renal disease. Diagnosis and treatment regimens of CKD are discussed. Geriatric patients are at an increased risk for renal dysfunction from many causes. Some causes are inherent with aging, such as gross structural and cellular changes, decrease in physiologic function, and lowered vascular compensatory reserve. Exposures, including medications and diagnostic testing, are contributors to acute kidney injury.

N2  - The burgeoning population of older dialysis patients presents opportunities to provide personalized care. The older dialysis population has a high burden of chronic health conditions, decrements in quality of life and a high risk of death. In order to address these challenges, this review will recommend routinely establishing prognosis through the use of prediction instruments and communicating these findings to older patients. The challenges to prognosis in adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) include the subjective nature of clinical judgment, application of appropriate prognostic tools and communication of findings to patients and caregivers. There are three reasons why we believe these conversations occur infrequently with the dialysis population. First, there have previously been no clinically practical instruments to identify individuals undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) who are at highest risk for death. Second, nephrologists have not been trained to have conversations about prognosis and end-of-life care. Third, other than hospitalizations and accrual of new diagnoses, there are no natural milestone guidelines in place for patients supported by dialysis. The prognosis can be used in shared decision-making to establish goals of care, limits on dialysis support or parameters for withdrawal from dialysis. As older adults with ESRD benefit from kidney transplantation, prognosis can also be used to determine who should be referred for evaluation by a kidney transplant team. The use of prognosis in older adults may determine approaches to optimize well-being and personalize care among older adults ranging from hospice to kidney transplantation. © 2013 The Author.

N2  - Objective The ability of nursing home residents to function independently is associated with their quality of life. The impact of amputations on functional status in this population remains unclear. This analysis evaluated the effect of amputations - transmetatarsal (TM), below-knee (BK), and above-knee (AK) - on the ability of residents to perform self-care activities. Methods Medicare inpatient claims were linked with nursing home assessment data to identify admissions for amputation. The Minimum Data Set Activities of Daily Living Long Form Score (0-28; higher numbers indicating greater impairment), based on seven activities of daily living, was calculated before and after amputation. Hierarchical modeling determined the effect of the surgery on postamputation function of residents. Controlling for comorbidity, cognition, and prehospital function allowed for evaluation of Activities of Daily Living trajectories over time. Results In total, 4965 residents underwent amputation: 490 TM, 1596 BK, and 2879 AK. Mean age was 81 years, and 54% of the patients were women. Most were white (67%) or black (26.5%). Comorbidities before amputation included diabetes mellitus (70.7%), coronary heart disease (57.1%), chronic kidney disease (53.6%), and/or congestive heart failure (52.1%). Mortality within 30 days of hospital discharge was 9.0%, and hospital readmission was 27.7%. Stroke, end-stage renal disease, and poor baseline cognitive function were associated with the poorest functional outcome after amputation. Compared with residents who received TM amputation, those who had BK or AK amputation recovered more slowly and failed to return to baseline function by 6 months. BK was found to have a superior functional trajectory compared with AK. Conclusions Elderly nursing home residents undergoing BK or AK amputation failed to return to their functional baseline within 6 months. Among frail elderly nursing home residents, higher amputation level, stroke, end-stage renal disease, poor baseline cognitive scores, and female sex were associated with inferior functional status after amputation. These factors should be strongly assessed to maintain activities of daily living and quality of life in the nursing home population. Copyright © 2014 by the Society for Vascular Surgery.

N2  - Purpose A previous clinical trial showed that radiologic insertion of first peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters by modified Seldinger technique is noninferior to laparoscopic surgery in patients at low risk in a clinical trial setting. The present cohort study was performed to confirm clinical effectiveness of radiologic insertion in everyday practice, including insertion in patients with expanded eligibility criteria and by fellows in training. Materials and Methods Between 2004 and 2009, 286 PD catheters were inserted in 249 patients, 133 with fluoroscopic guidance in the radiology department and 153 by laparoscopic surgery. Survival analyses were performed with the primary outcome of complication-free catheter survival and secondary outcomes of overall catheter survival and patient survival. Outcomes were assessed at last follow-up, as long as 365 days after PD catheter insertion. Results In the radiologic group, unadjusted 365-day complication-free catheter, overall catheter, and patient survival rates were 22.6%, 81.2%, and 82.7%, respectively, compared with 22.9% (P =.52), 76.5% (P =.4), and 92.8% (P =.01), respectively, in the laparoscopic group. Frequencies of individual complications were similar between groups. Adjusting for patient age, comorbidity, and previous PD catheter, the hazard ratio (HR) for catheter complications by radiologic versus laparoscopic insertion is 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.31); the HR for overall catheter survival is 1.25 (95% CI, 0.59-2.65); and that for death is 2.47 (95% CI, 0.84-7.3). Conclusions Radiologic PD catheter insertion is a clinically effective alternative to laparoscopic surgery, although there was poorer long-term survival with radiologic catheter placement, possibly because of preferential selection of radiologic insertion for more frail patients. © 2014 SIR.

N2  - Prognostication is a complex task and often avoided. Most chronic diseases follow well-known trajectories and yield straightforward clinical indicators regarding prognosis. Landmark clinical milestones in chronic disease give clinicians specific prognostication cues to share with patients. Published evidence supports that many chronic conditions have well-defined, readily obtainable bedside landmarks predictive of 50% 1-year or 5-year mortality. Approximating prognosis using bedside landmarks avoids time-intensive application of prognostic scoring systems. Well-informed discussions about prognosis allow patients and their families time to process and plan for end-of-life care choices. Appropriate end-of-life planning improves the quality of patient care. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The equations for estimating kidney function have become very popular in the last decade. However, the clinical and prognostic meaning of these measures may be very different in older populations. Two cohorts of people aged 65-89 years (older sample) and 90 or more (oldest old sample) were used to investigate the prognostic significance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Additionally, we also investigated whether combining frailty and eGFR may improve the accuracy of frailty in predicting mortality. We found that lower eGFR values were significantly more frequent among frail subjects in both groups. eGFR < 30 was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality either in subjects aged 65-89 years (HR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.23-11.2) or in those aged 90 or more (HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.05-2.23). In the latter group, a not significant trend for increasing mortality was also observed among people with eGFR > 60 (HR = 1.28, 95% CI = 0.72-2.26). In addition, the oldest old subjects with eGFR > 60 and eGFR < 30 had the lowest hand-grip strength and ADL values. Combining eGFR and frailty status significantly improved the accuracy of frailty in predicting mortality only in the older sample. In conclusion, a U-shaped relationship exists between eGFR and mortality in the oldest old, but not in older individuals. Our findings suggest that eGFR needs to be adjusted for muscle mass/physical performance when estimating kidney function in people aged 90 or more. Nevertheless, in subjects aged 65-89 years, eGFR may improve the accuracy of frailty status in predicting prognosis, thus suggesting that eGFR may represent an additional dimension of frailty syndrome. © 2014 American Aging Association.

N2  - Results 387 (53%) patients were frail based on self-reported function, of whom 209 (29% of the cohort) met the performance-based definition. Only 23 (3%) met the performance-based definition of frailty only. The self-report definition had 90% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 54% positive predictive value, 93% negative predictive value, and 72.5% overall accuracy. Intracellular water per kilogram of body weight and serum albumin, prealbumin, and creatinine levels were highest among nonfrail individuals, intermediate among those who were frail by self-report, and lowest among those who also were frail by performance. Age, percentage of body fat, and C-reactive protein level followed an opposite pattern. The modified self-report definition had better accuracy (84%; 95% CI, 79%-89%) and superior specificity (88%) and positive predictive value (67%).
Limitations Our study did not address prediction of outcomes.
Conclusions Patients who meet the self-report-based but not the performance-based definition of frailty may represent an intermediate phenotype. A modified self-report definition can improve the accuracy of a questionnaire-based method of defining frailty.
Study Design In a cross-sectional study, we compared prevalence and patient characteristics based on a frailty definition that uses self-reported function to the classic performance-based definition and developed a modified self-report-based definition.
Background A well-accepted definition of frailty includes measurements of physical performance, which may limit its clinical utility.
Setting & Participants Prevalent adult patients receiving hemodialysis in 14 centers around San Francisco and Atlanta in 2009-2011.
Index Tests Self-report-based frailty definition in which a score lower than 75 on the Physical Function scale of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) was substituted for gait speed and grip strength in the classic definition; modified self-report definition with optimized Physical Function score cutoff points derived in a development (one-half) cohort and validated in the other half.
Reference Test Performance-based frailty defined as 3 of the following: weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed.

N2  - Over the past three decades there has been a dramatic rise in the number of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. The fastest expanding group receiving dialysis has been the elderly. However, for those patients who are very elderly with co-morbidity, dialysis may not offer a survival advantage. Therefore, active conservative management is a growing service offered by many renal units in the UK and focuses on non-dialytic correction of fluid and electrolyes, management of renal anaemia, and assessment and management of symptoms. The five-year survival of a patient over 75 years of age starting dialysis is 20% and if a patient is over 75 years, has co-morbidity, or a poor performance status, dialysis may not offer any survival advantage. Whether a patient is managed by dialysis or by conservative management the symptom burden suffered is high. These symptoms are under-recognised and often managed poorly because of increased drug toxicity in renal failure. This complex group of patients require close working between renal, palliative care, medicine for the elderly, and community teams, to allow best quality of life and end of life care. This review describes some of the challenges in providing Advanced Care Planning for dialysis and conservatively managed patients, highlights the symptom burden of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, and offers guidance in how to manage the symptoms effectively.

N2  - Frailty is emerging as an important predictor in kidney transplantation (KT) recipients, including early hospital readmission and delayed graft function. We hypothesized that frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, might serve as a novel, independent predictor of immunosuppression tolerance and mortality in KT recipients of all ages. We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed) in 532 KT recipients at Johns Hopkins Hospital at admission for KT. Time to MMF dose reduction (<2000 mg/day) and mortality was identified from electronic medical records. 46% of recipients were non-frail (0 or 1 component), 32% were intermediately frail, and 22% were frail at KT. The mean change in frailty score from KT increased in the first month post-KT, was no different than at the time of KT in the second month and then decreased in third month post-KT. Compared to those who were non-frail, frailty was an independent predictor of immunosuppression tolerance (adjusted HR=1.37, 95% CI: 1.01-1.86, P=0.047) and mortality (adjusted HR=2.27, 95% CI: 1.03-5.01, P=0.04) in KT recipients. Although frailty improved after KT, recipients who were frail at the time of transplantation were at higher risk of immunosuppression tolerance and mortality. (Figure presented).

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally, studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible short-term effects on markers of physical performance. SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Frail elderly patients with advanced kidney disease experience many of the burdens associated with dialysis. Although these patients constitute the fastest-growing population starting dialysis, they often suffer loss of functional status, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality after dialysis initiation. Nephrology clinicians face the challenges of helping patients decide if the potential benefits of dialysis outweigh the risks and preparing such patients for future setbacks. A communication framework for dialysis decision-making that aligns treatment choices with patient goals and values is presented. The role of uncertainty is highlighted, and the concept of a goaldirected care plan is introduced. This plan incorporates a time-limited trial that promotes frequent opportunities for reassessment. Using the communication skills presented, the clinician can prepare and guide patients for the dialysis trajectory as it unfolds.

N2  - Evidence has recently been building that the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent contributor to decline in physical and cognitive functions in older adults. CKD affects 45% of persons older than 70 years of age and can double the risk for physical impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and frailty. To increase awareness of this relatively new concept of CKD as a risk factor for accelerated aging, we review studies on the association of CKD with physical function, frailty, and cognitive function. We also present a summary of the proposed mechanisms for these associations.

N2  - The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has increased exponentially throughout the world and there is rapid increase in elderly diabetics. DM is associated with increased mortality and considerable morbidity including stroke, heart disease, and diminished quality of life in the elderly. However, the unique features of geriatric diabetes have not been given due a prominence in medical literature. Hypoglycemia remains the biggest complicating factor and needs to be avoided in the elderly. Most people in the geriatric age group have some degree of renal insufficiency and medications need to be adjusted wisely with changing renal profile. Because safer and more effective pharmacological therapy is available, an individual approach to DM in the elderly is essential.

N2  - Conclusion Risk factors for superficial, deep, and organ space SSI differ. More effective prevention strategies may be developed by reporting and examining each type of SSI separately.
Background Most studies and national programs aggregate the different types of surgical site infections (SSIs) potentially masking and misattributing risk. Determining that risk factors for superficial, deep, and organ space SSIs are unique is essential to improve SSI rates.
Methods This cohort study utilized data of 59,365 patients who underwent colon resection at hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2007 to 2009. Four independent, multivariable, predictive models were developed to assess the unique associations between risk factors and each SSI group: Superficial, deep, organ space, and an aggregate of all 3 types of SSIs.
Results Overall, 13% of colon cases developed SSIs: Superficial (8%), deep (1.4%), and organ space (3.8%). Each model was different. Morbidly obese patients were more likely to develop SSIs than normal weight patients across all models; however, risk factors common to all models (eg, body mass index [BMI], duration of operation, wound class, laparoscopic approach) had very different levels of risk. Unique risks for superficial SSIs include diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dyspnea. Deep SSIs had the greatest magnitude of association with BMI and the greatest incidence of wound disruption (19.8%). Organ space SSIs were often owing to anastomotic leaks and were uniquely associated with disseminated cancer, preoperative dialysis, preoperative radiation treatment, and a bleeding disorder, suggesting a physically frail or compromised patient may put the anastomosis at risk.

N2  - In the last years we are witnessing a trend towards reduced numbers of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD), which may cause also a reduction in clinical expertise and research work in this area. We present several key opportunities and strategies for revitalisation of PD programs with a special emphasis on their feasibility and background evidence. Timely referral and proper pre-dialysis education are two crucial factors with largest potential to repopulate PD programs. Clinicians should consider using PD for unplanned acute dialysis starts. Implantation of peritoneal catheters by interventional nephrologists has a potential to alleviate some of the problems and barriers often encountered when other profiles take care of dialysis access. The possibility to offer assisted peritoneal dialysis to elderly frail patients should be part of all modern PD programs, since these are the patients whose quality of life on replacement therapy may benefit most from assisted modality performed in patient's home. The concept of "expiry date for PD" should be abandoned and replaced by a close monitoring, preventing measures, and timely prophylactictherapy in patients judged to be prone to EPS development.

N2  - Context. There are few data on the frequency and current management of clinical ethical issues related to care of seriously ill dialysis patients in free-standing dialysis facilities. Objectives. To examine the extent of clinical ethical challenges experienced by care providers in free-standing facilities and their perceptions about how those issues are managed. Methods. A total of 183 care providers recruited from 15 facilities in North Carolina completed a survey regarding the occurrence and management of ethical issues in the past year. Care plan meetings were observed at four of the facilities for three consecutive months. Also, current policies and procedures at each of the facilities were reviewed. Results. The two most frequently experienced challenges involved dialyzing frail patients with multiple comorbidities and caring for disruptive/difficult patients. The most common ways of managing ethical issues were discussions in care plan meetings (n = 47) or discussions with the clinic manager (n = 47). Although policies were in place to guide management of some of the challenges, respondents were often not aware of those policies. Also, although participants reported that ethical issues related to dialyzing undocumented immigrants were fairly common, no facility had a policy for managing this challenge. Participants suggested that all staff obtain training in clinical ethics and communication skills, facilities develop ethics teams, and there be clear policies to guide management of ethical challenges. Conclusion. The scope of ethical challenges was extensive, how these challenges were managed varied widely, and there were limited resources for assistance. Multifaceted efforts, encompassing endeavors at the individual, facility, organization, and national levels, are needed to support staff in improving the management of ethical challenges in dialysis facilities.

N2  - Background: Population based surveys have renewed the debate and have referred to the high prevalence of anemia among elderly people as a "public health crisis". Anemia of any degree is recognized as a significant independent contributor to morbidity, mortality, and frailty in elderly patients. Efforts to understand anemia in elderly has become a major target of research interest About one third of them have anemia secondary to nutritional defieciency, one third due to chronic inflammation or chronic renal disease, and one third have unexplained anemia. Aim: To study the morphlogical types and etiologies of anemias in elderly Material and methods: 100 patients (either sex, >60yrs) were selected, clinical data and various laboratory investigations, complete hemogram, reticulocyte count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and serum ferritin were done for all and special investigations like bone marrow study, endoscopy, ultrasound examinations etc were done wherever required. Based on history, clinical evaluation and the laboratory investigations, the anemias were morphologically and aetiologically classified. Results: Majority of the patients had hemoglobin levels in the range of 9.8 to 11.4gm%. Anemia was morphologically typed based on the peripheral smear findings and complete blood counts, into normocytic(42%), microcytic(28%), macrocytic(19%), and pancytopenia(11%). Majority of the cases, had anemia of chronic diseases(36%) followed by anemia of unknown etiology(24%). 17% included both hematological and non-hematological malignant cases. Conclusion: Until further data are available, anemia in the elderly should be evaluated and remediable causes treated, but the anemia itself should not be treated unless the patient is severely symptomatic or in danger of needing a transfusion.

N2  - Introduction: Over 100,000 bariatric surgical procedures are performed yearly to treat obesity and its associated complications. The rate of surgical complications from bariatric procedures remains low despite an increase in volume. When complications arise that require intensive care admission, morbidity and mortality is significantly increased up to 33%. Literature is lacking regarding Clavien level 4 (postoperative septic shock, postoperative dialysis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, prolonged ventilatory requirements, need for reintubation) and level 5 (mortality) complications in this patient population. Methods: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) participant use files were used to identify 89,799 patients undergoing elective bariatric procedures from 2005 to 2011, excluding emergency cases. A previously described modified frailty index (mFI) was calculated based on available NSQIP variables, with a higher index suggesting more frail patients. Postoperative critical events were identified and stratified to Clavien level 4 and level 5. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed with SPSS 21 software (IBM NY). Results: Overall 1% of elective bariatric cases experienced Clavien level 4 complications, with a mean frailty index of 0.87, as compared to those who did not experience these complications with a mean frailty index of 0.143. Univariate analysis demonstrated frailty was highly predictive of those with Clavien level 4 complications (p<0.001). Frailty was also significant (p<0.001) for Clavien level 5 complications (0.2% of elective cases), with a mean frailty index of 0.87 of those with complications vs mean frailty index of 0.162 without complications. For frail patients with Clavien 4 complications multivariate logistic regression confirmed an odds ratio of 7.3 (95% CI 4.33 to 12.34). Conclusions: Frailty can be used during patient selection to predict bariatric surgery patients at high risk for critical care level complications.

N2  - Objective To assess the feasibility and outcomes in patients undergoing transvenous transseptal (TS) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Background TS approach for TAVR was abandoned in favor of retrograde transfemoral, transaortic, or transapical approaches. TS TAVR may still be warranted in patients for whom no other approach is feasible. Methods Observational consecutive case series at a single center, to evaluate technical outcomes in inoperable patients with aortic stenosis who had contraindications for other approaches and who underwent TAVR via a transvenous TS antegrade approach using the Edwards-Sapien (ES) valve. Results Over a 4-month period, 9 patients underwent TS TAVR with 26 mm (n = 4) and 23 mm (n = 5) ES valves. Mean age was 84.5 ± 6.6 years and Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality was 7.8 ± 2.8%. Specific contraindications for other access included iliofemoral arterial diameter <7 mm in 9 (100%), porcelain aorta in 6 (66%) patients, multiple (≥2) sternotomies in 2 (22%) patients, severe pulmonary disease in 3 (33%), extreme frailty in 1 (11%), spinal stenosis with impaired ability to rehabilitate postsurgery in 1 (11%) and apical left ventricular thrombus in 1 (11%) patient. Antegrade deployment of the ES prosthetic valve was technically feasible in 8 patients. Major bleeding occurred in 4 patients, two patients suffered acute kidney injury without need for dialysis and one patient required a permanent pacemaker. The median (25th, 75th percentiles) fluoroscopy time was 49 (34, 81) minutes and contrast volume was 150 (120, 225) ml. No patient had hemodynamically significant post-TAVR aortic insufficiency nor damage to the mitral valve. At 6 months follow-up, there were no cerebrovascular events or rehospitalizations and mean NYHA Class improved from 3.4 to 1.7. Conclusions The antegrade TS approach to TAVR is a technically feasible option for "no-access" patients. Prospective assessment of the safety and efficacy of this approach in the current era warrants further study. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical outcomes. Methods. We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes. Results: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88]. Conclusions: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with clinical outcomes. © 2013 Walker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Background: Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of falls, with subsequent complications including fractures, loss of independence, hospitalization, and institutionalization. Factors associated with falls are poorly understood in this population. We hypothesized that insights derived from studies of the elderly might apply to adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis; we focused on frailty, a phenotype of physiological decline strongly associated with falls in the elderly. Methods. In this prospective, longitudinal study of 95 patients undergoing hemodialysis (1/2009-3/2010), the association of frailty with future falls was explored using adjusted Poisson regression. Frailty was classified using the criteria established by Fried et al., as a combination of five components: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed. Results: Over a median 6.7-month period of longitudinal follow-up, 28.3% of study participants (25.9% of those under 65, 29.3% of those 65 and older) experienced a fall. After adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidity, disability, number of medications, marital status, and education, frailty independently predicted a 3.09-fold (95% CI: 1.38-6.90, P=0.006) higher number of falls. This relationship between frailty and falls did not differ for younger and older adults (P=0.57). Conclusions: Frailty, a validated construct in the elderly, was a strong and independent predictor of falls in adults undergoing hemodialysis, regardless of age. Our results may aid in identifying frail hemodialysis patients who could be targeted for multidimensional fall prevention strategies. © 2013 McAdams-DeMarco et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Increasing numbers of frail elderly with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and multiple comorbidities are undertaking dialysis treatment. This has been accompanied by increasing dialysis withdrawal, thus warranting investigation into why this is occurring and whether a different approach to choosing treatment should be implemented. Despite being a potentially life-saving treatment, the physical and psychosocial burdens associated with dialysis in the frail elderly usually outweigh the benefits of correcting uraemia. Conservative management is less invasive and avoids the adverse effects associated with dialysis, but unfortunately it is often not properly considered until patients withdraw from dialysis. Shared decision-making has been proposed to allow patients active participation in healthcare decisions. Through this approach, patients will focus on their personal values to receive appropriate treatment, and perhaps opt for conservative management. This may help address the issue of dialysis withdrawal. Moreover, shared decision-making attempts to resolve the conflict between autonomy and other ethical principles, including physician paternalism. Here, we explore the ethical background behind shared decision-making, and whether it is genuinely in the patient's best interests or whether it is a cynical solution to encourage more patients to consider conservative care, thus saving limited resources. © The Author 2013.

N2  - Background Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults but is underrecognized and undertreated. The approach to pain assessment and management in older adults requires an understanding of the physiology of aging, validated assessment tools, and common pain presentations among older adults. Objective To identify the overall principles of pain management in older adults with a specific focus on common painful conditions and approaches to pharmacologic treatment. Methods We searched PubMed for common pain presentations in older adults with heart failure, end-stage renal disease, dementia, frailty, and cancer. We also reviewed guidelines for pain management. Our review encompassed 2 guidelines, 10 original studies, and 22 review articles published from 2000 to the present. This review does not discuss nonpharmacologic treatments of pain. Results Clinical guidelines support the use of opioids in persistent nonmalignant pain. Opioids should be used in patients with moderate or severe pain or pain not otherwise controlled but with careful attention to potential toxic effects and half-life. In addition, clinical practice guidelines recommend use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with extreme caution and for defined, limited periods. Conclusion An understanding of the basics of pain pathophysiology, assessment, pharmacologic management, and a familiarity with common pain presentations will allow clinicians to effectively manage pain for older adults. © 2013 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

N2  - The current practice of hemodialysis for the frail elderly frequently ignores core bioethical principles. Lack of transparency and shared decision making coupled with financial incentives to treat have resulted in problems of overtreatment near the end of life. Imminent changes in reimbursement for hemodialysis will reverse the financial incentives to favor not treating high-risk patients. In this article, we describe what is empirically known about the approach to hemodialysis today, and how it violates four core ethical principles. We then discuss how the new financial system turns physician and organizational incentives upside down in ways that may exacerbate the ethical dilemmas, but in the opposite direction. © 2013 Society of General Internal Medicine.

N2  - Purpose of Review: Despite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of physical functioning and encouragement of physical activity in management of the patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), implementation has been undermined by a lack of understanding of the evidence for this recommendation. The purpose of this review is to present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic cohorts that report associations between low levels of physical functioning and/or low physical activity and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD. Recent Findings: Low levels of physical activity and poor physical functioning are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical outcomes in adult patients with CKD, regardless of treatment modality. Low physical performance and activity limitations are more prevalent in patients with CKD, regardless of age, compared to older community-dwelling adults. Summary: The strength of the evidence presented should strongly motivate a focus of treatment on assessing and improving physical activity and physical function as part of routine patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical activity interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that is similar to or higher than the general population of elderly adults; physical activity, physical function, and performance are strongly associated with all-cause mortality; and exercise training and exercise counseling have been shown to improve measures of physical functioning.

N2  - Background Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) develop in the setting of immunosuppression following solid organ transplant or allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT). Other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders ('PTLD-like') can occur with the use of immunosuppressive agents for autoimmune or related disorders. The optimal first-line treatment and risk stratification tool for PTLD remains unclear and rituximab (R) monotherapy is often used following a reduction of immunosuppression (RIS), reserving combination chemotherapy for those failing this initial approach. However, this approach may not be suitable in those with high risk disease. The aim of this study was to review the outcome of patients with PTLD and PTLD-like disease, Methods Using the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) Lymphoid Cancer Database, all patients diagnosed with PTLD and PTLD-like conditions from 1981-2013 were identified, excluding primary CNS lymphoma, low-grade lymphomas and HIV associated lymphomas. Results 104 patients were identified: 86 PTLD and 18 PTLD-like. PTLD: Median age 47 y (range 6-71); 64% male; 60% late onset (> 1 year from transplant); 71% extranodal (EN) disease; 14% graft involved; 49% elevated LDH (n=36, missing n=13); 59% PS > 2 (n=45, missing n=10); 60% prior renal transplant. Pathology: 57% EBV positive (n=43, missing n=11); 2% early lesions, 13% polymorphic, 79% monomorphic (83% DLBCL), 1.1% classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) and 4.7% unknown. All patients underwent initial RIS, followed by: observation (n=23, 27%), single agent rituximab (n=37, 43%), anthracycline based combination chemotherapy + R (n= 9 (n=6 + R), 10%), single agent chemotherapy + R (n=8 (n=4 + R), 9%); 4 (5%) were too frail to treat. With a median follow-up for living patients of 4.0 y (range 0.8-16.2 y), the 3-y OS and 3-y TTP were 50% and 48%, respectively. Polymorphic cases had a more favorable outcome compared to monomorphic cases with a 3-y OS of 91% vs. 45% (p=0.029) and a 3-y TTP of 73% vs. 44% (p=0.037). Monomorphic PTLD prognostic factors (n=63): In univariate analysis for TTP, an elevated LDH (p=0.006), poor PS >2 (p=.0012), EN sites > 1 (p=0.005), B symptoms (p=0.0019) and GI (p=0.022), kidney (p=0.009) and hepatic (p<0.00001) involvement were all associated with an inferior TTP. Similarly, elevated LDH (p= 0.028), poor PS (p=0.0001) and kidney involvement (p=0.027) were associated with a poor OS. A high IPI score was associated with an inferior outcome: 3-y OS and 3-y TTP for low (0,1) (n=20), intermediate (2,3) (n=34) and high risk (4,5) (n=14) groups were 69%, 40%, and 21% (p=0.03) and 83%, 28%, and 14% (p<0.0001), respectively. For monomorphic DLBCL cases receiving single agent rituximab (n=29), a higher IPI was also associated with a worse 3-y OS (76%, 64%, and 20%, p=0.018) and 3-y TTP (67%, 27%, and 20%, p=0.03) for the low, intermediate and high risk groups, respectively. PTLD-like: Median age 63 y (range 26-74); 50% male; 51% EN disease; 33% LDH elevated (n=6); 44% PS > 2 (n=7, missing n=2); 92% EBV positive (n= 12, missing n=5). Pathology: 1 polymorphic (6%); 15 monomorphic (83%) (DLBCL n=11, 73%, DLBCL/CHL grey zone lymphoma n=2, 13%), 1 CHL (6%), 1 Hodgkin-like (6%), 1 unknown (6%). The majority of patients had a history of rheumatoid arthritis (n=10, 56%) and had been on treatment with methotrexate (n=10, 56%). The median time from onset of autoimmune disorder to the development of PTLD-like disease was 11 y (0.16-50) and the median duration of drug exposure prior to the development of the PTLD-like disease was 5 y (0.16-15y). All patients underwent RIS, followed by observation (n=6, 32%); single agent rituximab (n=4, 21%); anthracycline based combination chemotherapy + R (n=6, 37%; R, n=4); or single agent chemotherapy + R (n=1, 5.3%); 1 was too frail. With a median follow-up of 4.9 y (range 0.3-17 y), the 3-y TTP and OS were 65% and 77%, respectively. Conclusion For PTLD, a select group of patients with a low IPI score appear to have high cure rates with single agent rituximab. For those with multiple IPI factors a risk-adapted strategy with earlier use of chemotherapy may be preferred. In the group with PTLD-like disease we observed Hodgkin lymphoma and Hodgkin-like proliferations but also grey zone lymphomas, the latter of which has not been previously reported. Patients with PTLD-like disorders have a more favorable outcome than those with PTLD.

N2  - Background: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established. Methods: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty status. Results: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49 (36-62) ml/min/1.73 m2, and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m2, the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61 points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p = 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated with worse frailty status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Conclusions: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted interventions. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - The global population is progressively aging, to the extent that over 1.5 billion people worldwide will be aged 65 years or more by 2050, and the prevalence of end-stage renal disease in the elderly will remain high in forthcoming years. Since older patients typically suffer from several comorbidities, the above issue poses a hefty financial burden on healthcare systems. Although current guidelines might be useful for older individuals with fewer comorbidities and no significant disability, a tailored therapeutic approach is often essential in individuals with severe comorbidities, short life expectancy or poor treatment compliance. In such patients, rather than aggressively pursuing different therapeutic targets, physicians should strive to enhance quality of life by treating comorbidity-related symptoms and addressing common geriatric syndromes, including cognitive impairment, depression, incontinence, falls and polypharmacy, and the decision about starting dialysis should be guided not only by medical reasons, but also by patients' personal beliefs and preferences. © 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - Background: In-hospital incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients on warfarin undergoing coronary stent implantation (PCI-S) has been shown to be affected by procedural and patientrelated variables. As elderly patients are a more frail population, we aimed at evaluating whether the inhospital management and outcome were different compared to younger patients. Methods: The WARfarin and coronary STENTing (WAR-STENT) registry is a prospective, multicenter, observational study and included 411 consecutive patients on chronic warfarin undergoing PCI-S at 37 Italian centres between November 2008 and June 2010. The outcome measures were MACE, including death, myocardial infarction, need for urgent revascularization, stroke and venous thromboembolism, and major and minor TIMI bleeding. Results: Patients undergoing PCI-S ≥ 75 years showed a higher prevalence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (74% vs 63%, p = 0.014) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (35% vs 21%, p = 0.002). No significant differences regarding peri-procedural management were observed, except the preferred use of bare metal stent in older patients (64% vs 53%, p = 0.034). MACE rate was similar, however an excess of major bleeding in patients ≥ 75 years was observed (3,5% vs 0,5%, p = 0.045). Conclusions: In a real-world population of warfarin treated patients undergoing PCI-S, patients ≥ 75 years are slightly more frequent, and are at higher overall risk, as shown by the higher prevalence of ACS and CKD. In-hospital management is generally carried out according to current recommendations, with no differences in the two groups, except for the preferred use of bare metal stent in older patients. Nonetheless, a significantly higher incidence of in-hospital major bleeding was observed in patients ≥ 75 years, thereby confirming the greater frailty of such subgroup also among patients on chronic warfarin.

N2  - Most patients starting dialysis can choose between peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. There is little evidence proving that one form of dialysis is better than the other; although there may be an early advantage to peritoneal dialysis (PD) in young patients with residual function this effect is short-lived. Technique failure develops after years on PD so dialysis modality will often change during a long dialysis career. Quality of life studies, which must be interpreted carefully, indicate that patients require information about the impact of dialysis on their lifestyle as well as health-related outcomes so that they can choose the most suitable dialysis modality. Increasing numbers of frail elderly patients are starting dialysis; support in the home by nursing staff may facilitate the use of PD in this group. In the UK guidelines prioritise the patient's choice of dialysis modality (where feasible) based on good quality predialysis education. Cost of treatment is generally lower on PD, which is particularly recommended for patients with residual renal function and few comorbidities.

N2  - Aims: The Cockcroft-Gault (CG), the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) formulae are often used to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The objective was to determine the best method for estimating GFR in older adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the geriatric wards of two hospitals in The Netherlands. Patients aged 70 years or above with an estimated (e)GFR below 60mlmin-11.73m-2 were included. The CG, CG calculated with ideal bodyweight (IBW), MDRD and CKD-EPI formulae were compared with a criterion standard, sinistrin clearance. Renal function was classified into five stages according to the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative chronic kidney disease classification, as follows (in mlmin-11.73m-2): stage1, eGFR≥90; stage2, eGFR of 60-89; stage3, eGFR of 30-59; stage4, eGFR of 15-29; and stage 5, eGFR<15. Results: Sixteen patients, 50% male, with a mean age of 82 years (range 71-87years) and mean body mass index 26kgm-2 (range 18-36kgm-2), were included. On average, all formulae slightly overestimated GFR, as follows (in mlmin-11.73m-2): CG +0.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) -28 to +28]; CG with IBW +0.03 (95% CI -20 to +20); MDRD +9 (95% CI -16 to +34); and CKD-EPI +5 (95% CI -20 to +29). They classified kidney disease correctly in 68.8% (CG), 75% (CG with IBW), 43.8% (MDRD) and 68.8% (CKD-EPI) of the participants, respectively. Conclusions: The CG, CG with IBW, MDRD and CKD-EPI formulae estimate the mean GFR of a population rather well. In individual cases, all formulae may misclassify kidney disease by one stage. © 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.

N2  - Background: Alzheimer's disease and other dementia are mainly encountered in the elderly, who use numerous medications. Some of these drugs may be considered as potentially inappropriate if their benefit/risk ratio is not judged favourable in this frail and old population. Objectives: To assess the prevalence and the risk factors of potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) use in the elderly with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. Methods: A cross-sectional observational multicentre study was conducted from 1/2009 to 6/2011 in six metropolitan regions and 1 over-sea region of France. Patients with dementia aged 75 years and more, treated with cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine were included. They were selected according to a representative sample based on their usual dwelling place (home or institution). Socio-demographic data, history, drugs given were registered. PIM use was estimated using the French PIM list (Eur J Clin Pharmacol 2007; 63:725- 31). Results: 594 subjects were included; 63.6% living at home and 36.4% in institution. Mean age was 84.2 ± 5.0 years [75-99] and 73.7% of subjects were women. Mean MMSE was 16.9 ± 6.0 [0-29]; 74.9% of the patients suffered from Alzheimer's disease. The mean number of drugs (6.6 ± 2.8) and the PIM use prevalence (44.6% [95%CI: 40.6-48.7%]) were not significantly different between the metropolitan (44.1%) and the overseas areas (51.1%). The most often used PIM were (87.5%): benzodiazepines, association of psychotropics, cerebral vasodilators, association of anticholinesterasics and anticholinergics. The risk factors of PIM use were polymedication (OR = 4.0, 95%CI: 2.5-6.4), life in institution (OR = 1.9, 95%CI: 1.3-2.7) and being a woman (OR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.0-2.2). Conclusions: The use of PIM is high in the French population of patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. These drugs should be used cautiously in these patients as they could aggravate memory and dementia.

N2  - Introduction Therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest has been shown to favorably impact survival and neurologic outcome. The risk of cooling a patient with scleroderma and Reynaud's phenomenon would appear to be significant. Results A 45 year old female with end stage renal disease, CAD, scleroderma, and Reynaud's phenomenon was undergoing her daily dialysis when she arrested. Initial EKG showed ventricular fibrillation. CPR/ACLS was initiated with ROSC in 20 minutes. She did not immediately regain consciousness. Patient was cooled to 33 degrees and maintained at that temperature for 24 hours per protocol. Surface cooling was necessitated because of access issues. She was counterwarmed from the initiation of hypothermia using active warming blankets, Rooke boots, and Rooke mitts. Norepinephrine drip was needed for blood pressure support in the first 24 hours. Extremities were closely monitored for signs of vascular compromise during cooling and re-warming phase. Rewarming was carried out at 0.2 degrees per hour. Patient was following commands and extubated by day 4 post-arrest with neither neurologic deficit nor ischemia of extremities or digits. Conclusions Patients with scleroderma and Reynaud's phenomenon would appear to be at very high risk for ischemic complications of therapeutic hypothermia. There is a previous case report that details a scleroderma/Reynaud's patient who suffered digit ischemia after cooling for cardiac arrest. In our rather frail 50kg patient, we chose to aggressively counter-warm and protect her extremities from the outset of cooling because she had previously lost a digit to ischemia. Intravascular cooling would have been our first choice in this patient, but was not an option due to access graft in one groin and a previous vascular reconstruction of the other. The risk of therapeutic hypothermia in a patient with Reynaud's might discourage the provider from considering its use in such seemingly high risk paitients. We have demonstrated that it can be successfully accomplished in a patient who has previously suffered ischemic complications of Reynaud's.

N2  - Although sarcopenia is thought to underlie the manifestations of frailty, association of frailty with measures of body composition is underinvestigated. Methods: Eighty hemodialysis patients were included in the study. Performance-based frailty (PbF) used gait speed over 20 feet and 5 sit-to-stand (1 point each for lowest quintile) for the physical components of the frailty phenotype plus exhaustion (Short Form-36 [SF-36] vitality score <55) and physical activity (lowest quintile of weekly kcal energy expenditure on leisure activity on the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly questionnaire; 1 point). Function-based frailty (FbF) defined by questionnaire measures of physical functioning (SF-36 Physical Function score <75; 1 point), exhaustion, and physical activity as for PbF. A score of 2 or greater was defined as frail. Outcomes related to muscle size included muscle area of the contractile tissue of the anterior tibialis and quadriceps muscles using magnetic resonance imaging, phase angle using bioimpedance analysis, lean body mass using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and body mass index (BMI). Linear regression was used to analyze associations between frailty and muscle size, with and without sex and age covariates. Results: Fifty-nine percent of individuals met PbF criteria, 63% met FbF criteria, and 55% met both. In univariate analysis, PbF and FbF were associated with smaller muscle area of the quadriceps, smaller phase angle, and higher BMI. Associations remained significant for the quadriceps after adjustment for age and sex. The magnitude of association of PbF with quadriceps muscle area wasgreater than 10 years of age (-30.3 cm2 P = .02 vs. -6.6 cm2 P < .0001) in multivariate analysis. There was no significant association between either measure of frailty and other measures of body composition after adjustment for age and sex. Conclusion: Frailty was associated with measurements related to muscle size in a population of individuals with chronic kidney disease, a known contributor to muscle wasting. © 2013.

N2  - The prevalence of chronic pain increases with age, although solid and comparable epidemiological data addressing the oldest old and specific settings are still sparse. Chronic pain is associated with multimorbidity, disability and reduced quality of life. However, in many cases it goes undetected, it is not adequately screened and assessed, and treatment is suboptimal. Most drugs used for pain treatment carry a higher risk of side effects in older subjects. This paper explores the epidemiology, screening, diagnosis and management of chronic pain in old age in three European countries. Chronic pain may go undiagnosed, as screening programs for identification of this problem are yet uncommon, both in community care and in hospitals and nursing homes. Pain assessment is increasingly (but not universally) a part of comprehensive geriatric assessment, and most geriatricians receive training and seem to be confident in the diagnosis and management of chronic pain in complex or frail patients. Primary care physicians are usually the first providers to manage chronic pain, and only some patients are referred for specialist care. Pain clinics are widely available in the three countries, but older patients do not usually reach them. Acetaminophen is the mainstay of treatment of chronic pain, with reducing - but yet significant - use of NSAIDs and increasing use of weak opioids, mostly tramadol. Strong opioids are not widely used in older subjects, and concerns about side effects and on the choice of drugs in chronic renal disease are still present. Non-pharmacological therapies are not standardised. Attitudes towards chronic pain may hinder identification and management of this highly prevalent geriatric problem. © 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS and European Union Geriatric Medicine Society.

N2  - Introduction.- Anemia is more prevalent among the elderly and mostly among those with multiples comorbidities, who represent the frailest elderly. It constitutes a risk of decompensation of this frailty. Aims of this study was to evaluate impact of anemia on fatigue and quality of life (QoL) among elderly over 75, based on the hemoglobin level, and to identify the etiologies of anemia, the treatment prescribed and the clinical and functional impact of the treatment. Methods.- A prospective and observational cohort study was conducted in the acute geriatric unit of the Hospital of Reims among patients over 75. Socio-demographic and geriatric characteristics, hemoglobin level, assessment of fatigue and QoL (FACT-An and SF- 36) were collected at admission and on discharge. Etiology and treatment of anemia were collected from medical records. Results.- A total of 66 patients were included, 36 of them presented anemia (54.5%). Mean hemoglobin level was 104.6 g/L. Fatigue and QoL were impacted by anemia with a reduction in FACT-An (P = 0.0296), FACT-F (P = 0.0356) and “anemia score” of FACT-An (P = 0.0369) scores. Main etiologies of anemia were chronic kidney disease, inflammation and nutritional deficiencies. A treatment of anemia was prescribed to 15 patients (42.8%). Key conclusion.- There is a functional impact of anemia in the elderly in terms of Qol and fatigue. Medical management of anemia in this population can't be a transposition of the one applied to the general population and must be adapted to the specificities of the elderly in terms of tolerance to anemia.

N2  - Because the fastest-growing group of patients undergoing dialysis is older than 75 years, geriatricians will be more involved in decisions regarding the appropriate treatment of end-stage renal disease. A thoughtful approach to shared decision making regarding dialysis or nondialysis medical therapy (NDMT) includes consideration of medical indications, patient preferences, quality of life, and contextual features. Determination of prognosis and expected performance on dialysis based on disease trajectories and assessment of functional age should be shared with patients and families. The Renal Physician Association's guidelines on shared decision making in dialysis offer recommendations to help with dialysis or NDMT decisions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease prevalence will continue to rise due to increased life expectancy and population ageing. It is likely that the decline in glomerular filtration rate with increasing age represents a renal manifestation of widespread vascular disease. In addition to its associated cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease in older people is associated with increased prevalence of geriatric syndromes such as functional and cognitive decline, which lead to disability and frailty. Competing risks for mortality, because of the co-existence of multiple co-morbidities in old age, means that the majority of older people with chronic kidney disease will not progress to end-stage renal disease. Management of chronic kidney disease in older people is complex and an individualized and holistic, rather than disease-orientated, approach is necessary, which takes into account patients' priorities and wishes, especially frail and very elderly populations with multiple co-morbidities. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.

N2  - Early hospital readmission (EHR) after kidney transplantation (KT) is associated with increased morbidity and higher costs. Registry-based recipient, transplant and center-level predictors of EHR are limited, and novel predictors are needed. We hypothesized that frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics and recently associated with early KT outcomes, might serve as a novel, independent predictor of EHR in KT recipients of all ages. We measured frailty in 383 KT recipients at Johns Hopkins Hospital. EHR was ascertained from medical records as ≥1 hospitalization within 30 days of initial post-KT discharge. Frail KT recipients were much more likely to experience EHR (45.8% vs. 28.0%, p = 0.005), regardless of age. After adjusting for previously described registry-based risk factors, frailty independently predicted 61% higher risk of EHR (adjusted RR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.18-2.19, p = 0.002). In addition, frailty improved EHR risk prediction by improving the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (p = 0.01) as well as the net reclassification index (p = 0.04). Identifying frail KT recipients for targeted outpatient monitoring and intervention may reduce EHR rates. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study of kidney transplant recipients, the authors find that frailty was a strong predictor of hospital readmission within 30 days of transplantation, improving risk prediction above and beyond registry-based predictors. © Copyright 2013 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.

N2  - Anemia is an important healthcare concern among the elderly. In these patients, the anemia is often mild, with a hemoglobin level >10g/dL. It is usually well tolerated, but might be responsible for several proteiform and/or atypical presenting complaints. In the elderly, anemia is usually of multifactorial origin, including chronic inflammation, chronic kidney disease, nutrient deficiencies and iron deficiency (approximately two-thirds of all cases). The remaining cases are unexplained (unknown etiology). In the elderly, the classic diagnosis of anemia, which is based on the mean corpuscular volume associated with a low hemoglobin level, might not be accurate. A predefined standardized diagnostic procedure should be followed. In the common case of frail elderly patients, all investigations should be carefully considered and invasive examinations undertaken where justified (risk-benefit balance). Nevertheless, most cases of anemia require further investigation and the underlying cause should be identified and treated whenever possible.

N2  - Nephrologists have focused on the uremic syndrome as an indication for dialysis. The elderly frail renal patient approaching ESRD represents a complex biologic system that is already failing. This patient phenotype exhibits progressive geriatric disabilities and dependence interspersed with shrinking periods of stability regardless of whether dialysis is started. Consequently, the frail renal patient faces challenging treatment choices underpinned by ethical tensions. Identifying the advanced frail renal patient and optimizing the shared decision-making process will enable him or her to make well informed choices based on an understanding of his or her overall condition and personal values and preferences. This approach will also permit nephrologists to fulfill their ethical obligations to respect patient autonomy, promote patient benefit, and minimize patient harm. © 2013 by the American Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Bone fracture risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher than that in healthy subjects. Frailty caused by neuromuscular impairment as well as bone fragility due to bone loss and impaired bone quality is thought to be involved in the elevated fracture risk in CKD. Altered material and structural properties might be attributed to the reduced bone strength. The structural properties in CKD patients are characterized in 1) cortical thinning and cortical porosity, and 2) irregular thickening and loss of connectivity in trabecular bone. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that skeletal changes in the structural properties may be initiated at earlier stage of CKD than we expected.

N2  - Objectives To quantify the prevalence of frailty in adults of all ages undergoing chronic hemodialysis, its relationship to comorbidity and disability, and its association with adverse outcomes of mortality and hospitalization. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Single hemodialysis center in Baltimore, Maryland. Participants One hundred forty-six individuals undergoing hemodialysis enrolled between January 2009 and March 2010 and followed through August 2012. Measurements Frailty, comorbidity, and disability on enrollment in the study and subsequent mortality and hospitalizations. Results At enrollment, 50.0% of older (≥65) and 35.4% of younger (<65) individuals undergoing hemodialysis were frail; 35.9% and 29.3%, respectively, were intermediately frail. Three-year mortality was 16.2% for nonfrail, 34.4% for intermediately frail, and 40.2% for frail participants. Intermediate frailty and frailty were associated with a 2.7 times (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-7.07, P =.046) and 2.6 times (95% CI = 1.04-6.49, P =.04) greater risk of death independent of age, sex, comorbidity, and disability. In the year after enrollment, median number of hospitalizations was 1 (interquartile range 0-3). The proportion with two or more hospitalizations was 28.2% for nonfrail, 25.5% for intermediately frail, and 42.6% for frail participants. Although intermediate frailty was not associated with number of hospitalizations (relative risk = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.49-1.16, P =.21), frailty was associated with 1.4 times (95% CI = 1.00-2.03, P =.049) more hospitalizations independent of age, sex, comorbidity, and disability. The association between frailty and mortality (interaction P =.64) and hospitalizations (P =.14) did not differ between older and younger participants. Conclusions Adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis have a high prevalence of frailty, more than five times as high as community-dwelling older adults. In this population, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent predictor of mortality and number of hospitalizations. © 2013, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2013, The American Geriatrics Society.

N2  - Background: Many people on dialysis suffer a variety of conditions that can affect frailty (the condition or quality of being frail), such as comorbidities, disabilities, dependence, malnutrition, cognitive impairment and poor social conditions. Frailty is suspected to affect quality of life (QoL). Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of the different components of frailty on the QoL of people on dialysis. Methods: We enrolled 203 out of 233 prevalent patients on dialysis in the Trieste area of Italy. We applied the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire, Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Subjective Global Assessment scales and Karnofsky Index. In addition we analysed their social conditions. Results: Dependence, malnutrition and disability had a negative role on QoL. Living with family and good social-economic conditions were significantly related to a better QoL. Conclusions: Dependence, malnutrition, disability, poor social and economic conditions have a significant effect on life quality. The role of comorbidities appears to be less important. Screening of patients, nutritional and functional rehabilitation and prevention of social isolation appear to be indispensable in guaranteeing a satisfactory life quality. © 2013 European Dialysis and Transplant Nurses Association/European Renal Care Association.

N2  - The number of elderly patients with end stage renal disease is constantly increasing. Conventional hämodiaylsis as the mainstay of renal replacement therapy is often poorly tolerated by frail eldery patients with multiple comorbidities. Although many of these patients would prefer a home based dialysis treatment, the number of elderly patients using peritoneal dialysis (PD) is still low. Impaired physical and cognitive function often generates insurmountable barriers for self care peritoneal dialysis. Assisted peritoneal dialysis can overcome many of these barriers and give elderly patients the ability of a renal replacement therapy in their own homes respecting their needs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Frailty is a common concern in chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, which is significantly related to fall, disability, hospitalization and mortality. However, there are few reports evaluating the frailty phenotype in a relatively stable, prevalent maintenance dialysis (MD) population.We studied the prevalence, correlates and clinical consequences of frailty in MD patients. Methods: This ongoing study has recruited ambulatory MD patients aged ≥20 years old on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis ≥6 months, without hospitalization history for the previous 3 months. Study participants completed the Korean version of Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 36 (KDQOL-36) and clinical data were obtained by review of medical records.We adopted frailty phenotype composed of the following components; 1) unintentional weight loss more than 4.5 Kg or 5% of the previous body weight for the last 1 year, 2) physical inactivity, 3) RAND-36 physical function (PF) scale <75 and vitality (VT) scale <55 as surrogates for weakness/slowness and exhaustion, respectively. Low PF scale was scored as 2 points and other components as 1 point for each. Those with 3 or more points were considered as “frail”. Results: The 1,100 participants evaluated were 55.5±13.2 years of age (mean±SD) on MD for 5.2±4.6 years; 55.8% were male. The overall prevalence of frailty was 33.4%, increased with aging (P<0.001); 19.4% in less than 40 years old, 18.2% in 40s, 32.6% in 50s, 38.4% in 60s and 61.3% in 70 years or older. Frail patients were more likely to be female (39.9 vs 28.2%; P<0.001), lower education level (P<0.001) and unemployed (39.4 vs 18.1%; P<0.001) and they also had significantly lower mean value of hemoglobin (10.4 vs 10.6 g/dL; P<0.001), blood urea nitrogen (58.1 vs 61.3 mg/dL; P =0.001) and serum creatinine (9.5 vs 10.8 mg/dL; P<0.001). Interestingly, frailty was associated with higher level of inflammation markers such as high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (1.0 vs 0.7 mg/dL; P =0.019) and ferritin (219.3 vs 187.5 ng/mL; P =0.002). In multivariate analysis. female gender (odds ratio (OR), 2.01 [95% CI, 1.21-3.31]), older age (OR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.03-1.07]) and higher hs-CRP (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.13-1.51]) showed significant association with frailty. The presence of frailty was associated also with fall-related injury for the past 1 year (OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.14-2.30]) and current disability (OR, 8.27 [95% CI, 5.35-12.78]). Conclusions: Frailty is extremely common even in a relatively healthy subset of prevalent MD patients. Frailty is independently associated with female gender, older age and higher inflammation state, which appears to be related also with adverse clinical outcomes such as fall-related injury and disability. Nephrologists should be more aware of and rank the prevention, early detection and treatment of frailty into high priority in the management of MD patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy that often leads to end stage kidney disease (ESKD), and consequently dialysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether dialytic treatment increased the risk for death in myelomatous patients with ESKD. Methods:We studied the causes of death in 170 patients with a novel diagnosis of MM and kidney impairment. Results: 65 patients (38%) presented with ESKD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 15 mL/min. This was the cohort analyzed for the aim of the study. Median age at presentation was 67.0 (43-86) years, males were 53.8% of the cohort, median eGFRwas 7.0 (1-14) mL/min. During a median follow-up time of 2.8 years (IQR 0.9-6.2), 47 patients (72.3%) died and 43 (66.2%) were treated with dialysis, either in the form of hemodialysis (70.4%) or peritoneal dialysis (29.6%). 80% of the patients who required renal replacement therapy (RRT), needed it within 7 days from presentation. The untreated uremic patients (33.8%) were deemed to be too frail to undergo any kind of RRT, and received a conservative management for ESKD. Both cohorts had the same hematologic treatment for MM, except for 3 patients who only received palliative care. The most common causes of death in the two groups were: infections (89.2%), uremia (7.6%, only in the conservatively managed group), bleeding (1.6%), myocardial infarction (1.6%). Patients with ESKD, who were treated with RRT did not have a higher risk for overall death than the untreated (39.5% vs. 21.1%, p= 0.245). We also found that the RRT treated cohort did not have a higher risk for infective death than the untreated (93.8% vs. 86.7%, p= 0.417). Conclusions: Our study highlights that MM is highly associated with ESKD at diagnosis. MM-related ESKD often requires RRT within few days from its development. Patients should promptly receive RRT if needed, as they may benefit from this therapy with a good quality of life. RRT does not represent a cause for increased overall or infective death.

We report a case of a 43-year-old HIV-positive, dialysis-dependent patient with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and severe MR, who was considered at high operative risk because of frailty. She was treated with a MitraClip as part of the REALISM high-risk registry. Her symptomatic MR improved but severe symptomatic mitral stenosis developed 28 months after the MitraClip procedure. At that point, she was felt to be a better operative candidate but required open mitral valve replacement. Pathologic examination demonstrated significant calcification of the leaflets around the MitraClip devices. © 2013 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

N2  - Background: Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) have a higher rate of falls than the general population, which contributes to their high morbidity and mortality. Although frailty has been shown to be an important predictor of falls in community-dwelling older adults, it is unclear whether frailty is associated with an increased risk of falls in adult hemodialysis patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional study of 140 patients undergoing hemodialysis in Baltimore, Maryland between 1/2009 and 3/2010, frailty defined by Fried criteria, number of comorbidities, and disability were measured on enrollment into the study. Participants reported whether they had experienced ≥1 falls in a six month period. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between frailty and falls adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, comorbidity, and disability. Effect modification was tested for by stratifying for age (>65 vs. ≤65) and sex. Results: Participant mean age was 60.6 years, 45.7% of participants were female and 83.6% were African American. 25.7% of the participants had ≥1 falls: 17% of nonfrail participants and 43% of frail participants (P=0.003). Of the 5 risk factors included in the model, the odds of ≥1 falls was greatest for those who were frail (Table 1). Frailty was associated with a 3.18-fold (95% CI: 1.39-7.27, P=0.006) increased odds of ≥1 falls adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, comorbidity, and disability. The association of frailty and falls did not differ between older and younger participants (interaction P=0.57) or male and female patients (interaction P=0.21). Conclusions: Frail patients on hemodialysis have increased odds of experiencing a fall regardless of age. Frailty may be a useful, novel metric to identify hemodialysis patients of all ages at increased risk of falls. (Table Presented).

N2  - Body: Black and Hispanic children with end-stage renal disesase (ESRD) experience longer waiting times for deceased donor kidney transplantation. However, prior studies have not examined whether these disparities in transplant access persist after adjustment for differences in organ availability at the organ procurement organization (OPO) level.Methods and Results: We used national data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to examine racial variation in time from waitlisting to receipt of deceased donor kidney for all children < 18 years from 2005-2010 (n=3943). Hispanic children had longer waiting times compared to children from other racial and ethnic groups (334 days (95% CI: 296-367) versus 279 days (95% CI: 233-308) for African-Americans and 250 days (95% CI: 226-282) for Caucasian children). In unadjusted analyses and in a multivariable Cox regression model that adjusted only for individual characteristics (age, gender, insurance, disease etiology), Hispanics had a 10% lower probability of transplant (HR 0.90, HR 0.038). However, waiting time for Hispanic children varied greatly across OPOs. With further adjustment for OPO level characteristics through the use of a multivariate frailty model, Hispanics no longer had reduced probability of transplant vs. whites (HR 1.03, p 0.585). We observed that Hispanics living in OPOs with longer overall waiting times had equally long wait times compared with white children.Conclusions: Previously observed longer waiting times for Hispanic vs. white children with ESRD may be partially explained by the finding that Hispanic children tend to live in OPOs with longer waiting times for kidney transplant. Future studies to reduce racial disparities in pediatric waiting times for deceased donor kidneys may need to closely consider geographic disparities. National sharing of kidneys for children may be one approach to reach racial parity in access to transpalnt. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: Falling and fall related injuries are a rising healthcare problem in the United States, costing approximately $28 billion and severely impacting quality of life and functional independence. Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) present with numerous co-morbidities and impairments limiting mobility and community access. In the general population, ∼30% of patients over 65 years of age, fall each year, causing approximately 20% to be dead within a year, 25% to be institutionalized for the remainder of their lives, increasing the chances of survivors to fall again by 2-300%, and significantly impacting the lives of all affected. The increased incidence of peripheral neuropathy, weakness, and immobility in patients with ESRD increase their fall risk. The prevalence of frailty and metabolic bone disease in the ESRD population increase fall related injuries, disability, morbidity, and mortality in this at risk population. In a seminal article Fried and colleagues describe patients diagnosed with frailty as having three (3) or more of the following criteria: 1) poor gross handgrip strength, 2) unintentional weight loss of more than 4.5 kg within a year, 3) exhaustion, 4) slow nor-mal walking speed, and 5) physical inactivity. Patients with ESRD on HD often present with the frail criteria, along with numerous other medical complexities and co-morbidities, contributing to physiological, psychological, and functional limitations. There have been few studies which have demonstrated reduced impairments in frail patients by reducing the criteria needed for a diagnosis of frailty. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a highly skilled outpatient physical therapy program on falls and functional outcome measures in frail patients with ESRD on HD. Methods: One hundred and seventy six (176) (85 females, mean age 67.11 ±12.3 and 91 males, mean age 65.74 ±11.38) patients from nine (9) different dialysis facilities participated in this quasi-experimental study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Touro College, New York, NY, and all study participants signed informed consents prior to participation. All study participants were evaluated by licensed physical therapists (PT) and non-randomly assigned into either a control (n = 89) or an experimental (n = 87) group. The following functional outcome measures were assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks: Falls during the intervention period (# of falls), hospitaliza-tions (#of hospitalizations), Sit to Stand repetitions in 30 seconds (STS30), 6 Minute Walk Test 6MWT, feet), Gross Grip Strength (Grip, lbs./sq. inch), 360° Turn (seconds), Timed Up and Go (TUG, seconds), 20' Normal Gait Speed (NGS, seconds), and 20' Fast Gait Speed (FGS, seconds). The experimental group participated in the skilled restorative physical therapy program (RPTP), 2-3x/week for 12 weeks. The RPTP included therapeutic activities and exercise, neuromuscular re-education, manual techniques, and therapeutic modalities. Patients in the experimental group were cued for proper technique and closely monitored via pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate, and rate of perceived exertion before, during and after all therapy interventions. Rest periods were timed, monitored, and utilized for postural cues, breath control, and patient education. Innovative, functional dynamic balance and mobility treatment techniques such as distracted walking, walking while talking, water carrying, lifting while gripping, and assisted multi-directional lunges were utilized during therapy sessions. The control group received standard HD care. Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics were used to summarize all demographic data, falls, hospitalizations, and functional outcome measures. The Mann-Whitney U Test was used to determine initial group equivalence (pretest) and to determine differences between groups (posttest). All data were analyzed at the 0.05 level of significance using IBM SPSS PASW Statistics© 18.0. Results: Study participants were not randomized into groups, however, pretest scores between groups for most outcome measures demonstrated group equivalence. Statistically significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups for falls, fall related hospitalizations, the STS30, 6MWT, Grip, 360° Turn, NGS, FGS, and hip fractures. During the 12 week study period, there were 37 falls in the control group, while only 14 falls in the experimental group. There were 29 fall related hos-pitalizations in the control group with only 8 in the experimental group, with 3 confirmed hip fractures in the control group, and none in the experimental group. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a RPTP implemented by skilled PTs on frail patients with ESRD on HD may significantly decrease falls and hospitalizations, and improve numerous functional outcome measures. The RPTP also identi-fied effective interventions that may be beneficial in improving mobility, physical activity, independent function, and quality of life in this very challenging, underserved, and medically complex patient population. A skilled PT program focused on fall prevention, increasing physical activity, enhancing grip strength, improving walking speed, and improving overall functionality may reduce the risk factors associated with frailty, thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality in this at risk population. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that a fall prevention initiative may decrease fall related hip fractures and hospitalizations, which when implemented properly, would pay for themselves in terms of cost savings to the healthcare system in the United States. Future studies with larger sample sizes, multi center programs, and more varied patient populations utilizing randomly assigned groups, should examine the long-term implications of such programs.

N2  - Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition) due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition, comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW. © 2013.

N2  - Older people constitute an increasingly greater proportion of patients with advanced CKD, including those patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment. Frailty is a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors that results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and causes vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty is common in elderly CKD patients, and it may be associatedwith protein-energywasting (PEW), sarcopenia, dynapenia, and other complications of CKD. Causes of frailtywith orwithout PEWin the elderly with CKDcan be classified into three categories: causes primarily caused by aging per se, advanced CKD per se, or a combination of both conditions. Frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients are associated with impaired physical performance, disability, poorer quality of life, and reduced survival. Prevention and treatment of these conditions in the elderly CKD patients often require a multifaceted approach. Here, we examine the causes and consequences of these conditions and examine the interplay between frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients. Copyright © 2013 by the American Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Introduction: More than 25% of the US population over 65 has diabetes mellitus (DM). The elderly population will double in the next four decades, and DM will triple. DM in older adults is associated with higher morbidity, mortality, and financial burden. Despite the high prevalence of diabetes in this group, they have often been excluded from randomized controlled trails. (Especially those over 75). There is a paucity of evidence to determine DM management strategies for these patients. Current guidelines are based on expert opinion and do not address the impact of multiple comorbidities or psychosocial variables. 1st case: 76 yo man with hx of DM for 20 years, peripheral and autonomic neuropathy, ESRD on HD, CAD, HTN, s/p B/L BKA, and gout presents with uncontrolled DM. He was prescribed insulin glargine (IG) 10 units TID, and insulin aspart (IA) sliding scale. He has been using (IG) and (IA) as a sliding scale but does not know the insulin doses secondary to cognitive impairment. He also has hypoglycemia unawareness. He presents with repeated ER visits for hypoglycemia. 2nd case: 83 yo veteran with hx of DM for 30 years, peripheral neuropathy, HTN, CHF, CAD, CVA, metastatic prostate cancer, glaucoma, and poor appetite with a 23 lb weight loss over 5 months. He is under hospice care. He was prescribed (IG) 80 units BID and (IA) 5 units BID. The hospice physician decreased IG dose to 15 units due to severe hypoglycemia, blood sugars were erratic, alternating between hyper and hypoglycemia. Conclusion: DM management in elderly people is complex, and the evidence base is lacking for treatment in this population. Due to multiple factors: cognitive deficits and dementia, (leading to inappropriate doses of hypoglycemic agents), renal disease (causing decreased clearance of insulin leading to hypoglycemia), visual and auditory impairment (causing errors in self administration of drugs), polypharmacy (causing adverse effects of hypoglycemic agents and higher risk of patient errors), decreased po intake at the-end-of-life (causing dehydration and hypoglycemia), and lack of family support (leading to irregular meal preparation and risk for hypoglycemia.) Due to the impact of multiple comorbidities and social factors, there is a need to individualize diabetic therapy in the frail older person to avoid hypoglycemia, while maximizing quality of life. This requires a multidisciplinary approach, as well as more research in this vulnerable population.

N2  - Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor is recommended for use as first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) who undergo high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention. However, revascularization may not be a beneficial option for some subgroups of patients with ACS. This includes a broad spectrum of lower risk patients as well as high-risk patients with numerous previous revascularizations and those who are at high risk for complications, such as those with complex coronary anatomy and co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or advanced age and frailty. For such patients, there remains an unmet need for evaluation of alternatives to the currently recommended treatment options. Notably, there is a paucity of prospective data regarding management approaches to medically managed patients with ACS. Thus, this group of medically managed patients with ACS would benefit from inclusion in clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for patients not scheduled to undergo invasive procedures, such as those who are targeted for pharmacologic management only. In conclusion, in this review, the investigators revisit data from clinical studies of dual-antiplatelet therapy in ACS to highlight areas of unmet need in antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS and to examine the use of newer agents in subgroups, such as medically managed patients with ACS, that would potentially benefit from more potent platelet inhibition after ACS. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Frailty is a physiologic state of increased vulnerability to stressors that results from decreased physiologic reserves or dysregulation of multiple physiologic systems. The construct of frailty has been operationalized as a composite of poor physical function, exhaustion, low physical activity, and weight loss. Several studies have now examined the prevalence of frailty among chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and have found frailty to be more common among individuals with CKD than among those without. Furthermore, frailty is associated with adverse outcomes among incident dialysis patients, including higher risk of hospitalization and death. Recent evidence shows that frail patients are started on dialysis earlier (at a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) on average than nonfrail patients, but it remains unclear whether these patients' frailty is a result of uremia or is independent of CKD. The survival disadvantage that has been associated with early initiation of dialysis in observational studies could be mediated in part through confounding on the basis of unmeasured frailty. However, available data do not suggest improvement in frailty upon initiation of dialysis; rather, the trajectory appears to be toward higher levels of dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs) after dialysis initiation. Overall, there are no data to suggest that frail patients derive any benefit from early initiation of dialysis either in the form of improved survival or functional status. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Background: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established. Methods: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty status. Results: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49 (36-62) ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61 points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p = 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated with worse frailty status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Conclusions: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted interventions.

N2  - The features of ageing complicate the management of end-stage renal disease. These complicate all dialysis modalities and will greatly affect the ability to cope with interventional treatments and quality of life. The presence of other illnesses and comorbidity associated with kidney disease mean that many patients have a poor prognosis. It is therefore important to consider the impact of dialysis on lifestyle and whether survival will actually be improved for frail older patients. This review article considers how haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be adjusted for older patients, and, in particular, how the use of assistance makes peritoneal dialysis more feasible. Most importantly, older patients should be given realistic information about their prognosis and how they can cope with different treatment options, and then they should be involved in the decisions about their management. © 2014 S.

N2  - Patients treated with dialysis have low levels of physical functioning and activity. Whether this translates into frailty or not may depend on how the frailty phenotype is operationalized. This is a secondary analysis of data from the Renal Exercise Demonstration Project to evaluate two methods of operationalizing the Fried phenotype for frailty: Using measured walking speed and muscle weakness (FRAILmeas) and using substitution of the Physical Function Scale (PF) from the SF-36 questionnaire for walking speed and muscle weakness (FRAILsubst). Complete data for both measures were available for 188 hemodialysis patients. The frailty score (FRAILmeas) was the sum of criteria scores for measured gait speed, chair stand, body mass index, vitality, and physical activity. The frailty score (FRAILsubst) substituted the PF scale score (<75) as a surrogate measure for gait speed and for weakness. The frailty score ranged from 0 to 5. Scores ≥3 were categorized as frail, and <3 as not frail. The substitution of the PF score for walking speed and muscle weakness resulted in 78% of patients being categorized as frail compared to 24% using actual measured walking speed and muscle weakness (P<.001). The component of frailty that had the highest prevalence was low physical activity (average 54% of subjects). Frailty (using the FRAILmeas) was higher in patients with increasing age, female gender, and lower self-reported PF. Frailty is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients; however, measured constructs of the components of frailty should be used to report the frailty phenotype.

N2  - Purpose of the Study: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid malignancy worldwide. Its incidence increases with age and about 40% of cases occur in patients over 70 years. Herein, we describe a case of a frail elderly patient with renal insufficiency and DLBCL treated with R-mini-CHOP. Case Report: A 77-year-old man on maintenance hemodialysis started experiencing persistent fatigue. He was diagnosed with a large mass on the left lobe of the lung. Biopsy demonstrated a DLBCL, CD20 positive. The patient was assigned clinical stage IIBX, with a high age-adjusted international prognosis index. A proper geriatric assessment revealed a frail patient. Thus, an adapted chemotherapy regimen was proposed which consisted of R-mini-CHOP every 21 days, with a reduction of 10% in the doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. During the treatment, the patient went through regular dialysis sessions, 3 times per week, with an extra session performed 12 h after each chemotherapy administration. The patient experienced no adverse events or grade 3/4 toxicities. After 6 cycles of R-mini-CHOP, the patient achieved unconfirmed complete remission, and consolidation radiotherapy was performed. At the last follow-up, he was still in unconfirmed complete remission, with a progression-free survival of 11.3 months. Conclusions: R-mini-CHOP represented a reasonable treatment option for this patient with renal failure. The oncogeriatric approach led to a successful management of this frail patient, highlighting that an adapted plan of care is a key issue to improve the outcomes of elderly cancer patients. © 2013 S.

N2  - Next to a high morbidity, patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) suffer from a complex spectrum of clinical manifestations. Both the phenotype of patients with ESRD as well as the pathophysiology of uremia show interesting parallels with the general aging process. Phenotypically, patients with ESRD have an increased susceptibility for both cardiovascular as well as infectious disease and show a reduction in functional capacity as well as muscular mass (sarcopenia), translating into a high prevalence of frailty also in younger patients. Pathophysiologically, the immune dysfunction, telomere attrition and the presence of low-grade inflammation in uremic patients also show parallels with the aging process. System models of aging, such as the homeodynamic model and reliability theory of Gavrilov may also have relevance for ESRD. The reduction in the redundancy of compensatory mechanisms and the multisystem impairment in ESRD explain the rapid loss of homeodynamic/homeostatic balance and the increased susceptibility to external stressors in these patients. System theories may also explain the relative lack of success of interventions focusing on single aspects of renal disease. The concept of accelerated aging, which also shares similarities with other organ diseases, may be of relevance both for a better understanding of the uremic process, as well as for the design of multidimensional interventions in ESRD patients, including an important role for early rehabilitation. Research into processes akin to both aging and uremia may result in novel therapeutic approaches. © 2013 The Author.

N2  - Purpose of the Study: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid malignancy worldwide. Its incidence increases with age and about 40% of cases occur in patients over 70 years. Herein, we describe a case of a frail elderly patient with renal insufficiency and DLBCL treated with R-mini-CHOP. Case Report: A 77-year-old man on maintenance hemodialysis started experiencing persistent fatigue. He was diagnosed with a large mass on the left lobe of the lung. Biopsy demonstrated a DLBCL, CD20 positive. The patient was assigned clinical stage IIBX, with a high age-adjusted international prognosis index. A proper geriatric assessment revealed a frail patient. Thus, an adapted chemotherapy regimen was proposed which consisted of R-mini-CHOP every 21 days, with a reduction of 10% in the doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. During the treatment, the patient went through regular dialysis sessions, 3 times per week, with an extra session performed 12 h after each chemotherapy administration. The patient experienced no adverse events or grade 3/4 toxicities. After 6 cycles of R-mini-CHOP, the patient achieved unconfirmed complete remission, and consolidation radiotherapy was performed. At the last follow-up, he was still in unconfirmed complete remission, with a progression-free survival of 11.3 months. Conclusions: R-mini-CHOP represented a reasonable treatment option for this patient with renal failure. The oncogeriatric approach led to a successful management of this frail patient, highlighting that an adapted plan of care is a key issue to improve the outcomes of elderly cancer patients.

N2  - Background: Heart failure (HF) disease management can improve health outcomes for older community dwelling patients with heart failure. HF disease management has not been studied in skilled nursing facilities, a major site of transitional care for older adults. Methods and anticipated results: The objective of this trial is to investigate if a HF- disease management program (HF-DMP) in skilled nursing facilities (SNF)s will decrease all-cause rehospitalizations for the first 60 days post-SNF admission. The trial is a randomized cluster trial to be conducted in 12 for-profit SNF in the greater Cleveland area. The study population is inclusive of patients with HF regardless of ejection fraction but excludes those patients on dialysis and with a life expectancy of 6 months or less. The HF-DMP includes 7 elements considered standard of care for patients with HF documentation of left ventricular function, tracking of weight and symptoms, medication titration, discharge instructions, 7-day follow-up appointment post-SNF discharge, and patient education. The HF-DMP is conducted by a research nurse tasked with adhering to each element of the program and regularly audited to maintain fidelity of the program. Additional outcomes include health status, self-care management, and discharge destination. Conclusions: The SNF-Connect Trial is the first trial of its kind to assess if a HF-DMP will improve outcomes for patients in SNFs. This trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness of HF-DMP to improve outcomes for older frail HF patients undergoing postacute rehabilitation. © 2013 American Medical Directors Association, Inc.

N2  - The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation, Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease (CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis) and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the oldest old with CKD.

N2  - The age of patients with end-stage renal disease is increasing in Europe and United States. In France, patients older than 75 years represent 40% of the patients who start renal replacement therapy (dialysis or renal transplantation). In these elderly patients with many comorbidities, the benefit of dialysis remains controversial. To provide clear information to patients about diagnosis, prognosis, and all treatment options, more data are needed on their clinical characteristics, therapeutic projects, and outcome. Researchers present here the ongoing Parcours de Soins des PersonnesAgées (PSPA) multicenter prospective study, which includes 581 patients with a mean age of 82±5 years and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (by sMDRD) of 14±4ml/min/1.73m(2) without dialysis. Despite a high prevalence of associated comorbidities, most of the patients are autonomous, living at home. Less than 10% are followed jointly by a nephrologist and a geriatrician. At inclusion, postponed dialysis decision due to stable estimated glomerular filtration rate was reported in 43%, 17% of the patients are under evaluation, the decision to start dialysis was chosen in 24% of the patients, nondialysis decision was decided in 16%. Geriatricians' expertise may help nephrologists to identify patients at high risk of early death for who nondialysis care may be discussed. They also may be more able to evaluate and anticipate the impact of such restricting treatments. A multidisciplinary approach of these old and frail patients' needs to be reinforced.

N2  - During the last century the considerable increase in life expectancy has led to important demographic changes and, consequently, to new clinical scenarios. Nowadays, chronic conditions, comorbidities and socio-economic factors constitute a relevant health management issue. In particular, the definition of frail elderly individuals has proven to have a strong role in the identification of high-risk patients, their clinical management and prognosis. Reorganization of the medical system has been associated with the development of new instruments for clinical assessment, focused on clinical and socio-economic issues, resulting in a multidimensional geriatric assessment. A large number of approaches have been validated in different clinical settings and populations, until the development of multidimensional instruments demonstrated to have a crucial role in the identification of frail individuals and in their clinical management. Interestingly, some of these, such as the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), proved to play a relevant role in mortality risk stratification even in particular clinical settings such as chronic kidney disease. © 2012 Società Italiana di Nefrologia.

N2  - Background: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Study Design: Observational study. Setting & Participants: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (by the CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Outcome: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy. Measurements: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum cystatin C concentrations (eGFRcys) to minimize confounding due to relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty. Results: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFRcys was 51 mL/min/1.73 m2. The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes, eGFRcys categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m2 were associated with a 2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of frailty compared with GFR cys <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. There were 63 events during a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or dialysis therapy. Limitations: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal relationships between CKD and frailty. Conclusions: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is associated with lower eGFRcys and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy. © 2012 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

N2  - Elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or who are on dialysis should be able to live as fully and comfortably as possible. Geriatric patients are most interested in outcomes that will optimize mental and physical function and limit suffering and pain. Nephrologists must help them answer the question: "How will my kidney problem affect the way I live now and in the future?" This means management must move beyond glomerular filtration rate-related targets and incorporate geriatric principles that focus on assessment of function, comorbidities, geriatric syndromes, and quality of life issues. Therapeutic decisions should be individualized and directed by patient goals of care, which must be explored and documented. Accomplishing this requires inclusion of the patient's family-support system in the shared decision-making process. There is no substitute for spending time listening to and understanding the patient and family agenda, providing timely medical and prognostic updates; discussing realistic scenarios to balance expectations; and planting the seeds of change as the quantity and quality of medical events, geriatric syndromes, and comorbidities accumulate. Synergy of the interdisciplinary renal team with geriatric and palliative medicine specialists provides the expertise to achieve these goals. This falls into the domain of geriatric renal palliative or supportive care (1) and is the subject of this practical review.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a cause of worsening physical functioning in older patients. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is highly reliable in older populations, but no data on older hospitalized patients with different degrees of kidney function are available. We aimed at testing the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and SPPB, either global score (range 0-12) or its individual components (muscle strength, balance, and walking speed, each ranging from 0 to 4), in a sample of older hospitalized patients. Our series consisted of 486 patients aged 65 or more consecutively enrolled in 11 acute care medical wards participating to a multicenter observational study. eGFR was obtained by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiological Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Physical performance was objectively measured by the SPPB. The relationship between eGFR and SPPB was investigated by multiple linear regression analysis. Physically impaired patients (SPPB total score<5) were older, had lower serum albumin and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores as well as higher overall co-morbidity, prevalence of stroke, cancer, and anemia compared to those with intermediate (SPPB=5-8) and good physical performance (SPPB=9-12). Fully adjusted multivariate models showed that eGFR (modeled as 10 mL/min per 1.73 m2 intervals) was independently associated with the SPPB total score (B=0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.18-0.66; p=0.003), balance (B=0.30; 95% CI=0.10-0.49; p=0.005), and muscle strength (B=0.06; 95% CI=0.01-0.10; p=0.043), but not with walking speed (B=-0.04; 95% CI=-0.09-0.11; p=0.107). In conclusion, reduced renal function is associated with poorer physical performance in older hospitalized patients. SPPB is worthy of testing to monitor changes in physical performance in elderly CKD patients. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - The ability to predict outcomes following kidney transplantation (KT) is limited by the complex physiologic decline of kidney failure, a latent factor that is difficult to capture using conventional comorbidity assessment. The frailty phenotype is an inflammatory state of increased vulnerability to stressors resulting from decreased physiologic reserve and dysregulation of multiple physiologic systems, recently described and validated in geriatrics patients. We hypothesized that frailty would be associated with delayed graft function (DGF), based on similar associations between inflammatory cytokines, frailty, and early graft dysfunction. Methods: We prospectively measured frailty (grip strength, walking speed, unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity, based on the Fried scale) in 183 KT recipients between 12/08-4/10. We also collected recipient factors (age, BMI, race, gender, time on dialysis, pre-emptive KT, history of cerebrovascular event and diabetes) as well as donor factors (donor type, creatinine, donation after cardiac death (DCD), extended criteria donors (ECD), and cold ischemia time (CIT)). Parsimonious models were designed by examining AIC and likelihood ratio tests for nested models. Independent associations (adjusted for donor and recipient factors) between frailty and DGF were analyzed using modified multivariate Poisson regression. Results: Rate of DGF was 30% in frail and 15% in non-frail recipients. After adjusting for multiple donor and recipient factors, frailty was independently associated with twice the risk of DGF (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.13-3.36, p-value=0.02). Conclusion: Frailty, an inflammatory construct developed in the geriatrics community, may provide further insights into the pathophysiology of allograft dysfunction and improve our ability to preoperatively risk-stratify KT recipients.

N2  - Novel antimyeloma agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib) may induce high rates of hematologic responses in patients with AL amyloidosis in whom they are increasingly used. Due to the multisystemic involvement many patients with AL are frail and vulnerable to treatment related toxicity and often succumb to their disease early after initiation of therapy, mainly due to complications associated with cardiac amyloidosis. In order to investigate the outcomes of AL patients in the era of novel agents and explore strategies to reduce complications and early mortality, we analyzed 81 consecutive patients in a single center (Department of Clinical Therapeutics, University of Athens, Greece). All patients were assessed and followed rigorously and received similar supportive care according to our institution's practice. Bortezomib (B) was given as first line or salvage therapy after 1/9/2005 and lenalidomide (L) was given as primary therapy or salvage after 1/1/2008. Beginning on 1/1/2011, we follow a risk-adapted strategy, in which previously untreated patients with AL received bortezomib at a dose and schedule adjusted according to performance status (PS), levels of cardiac biomarkers and age (BDa). Patients were divided in those who started therapy from 2005 to 31/12/2007 (23 patients), those who received therapy between 1/1/2008 to 31/12/2010 (36 patients) and those who started therapy after 1/1/2011 (22 patients): 54% received first line therapy with B, 40% with L and 6% received conventional therapy upfront (mostly melphalan with dexamethasone; all received novel agents at later stages of their disease). Most patients (57%) were males; the median age was 67 years (range 42-82 years); 55% had a PS 2; the heart was involved in 68% of patients, the kidneys in 70%, the liver in 9%, and the peripheral nerve in 25%. Median eGFR was 70 ml/min and 4% required dialysis at diagnosis. Median NTproBNP was 2318 ng/l (range 36-75000 ng/l) and according to cardiac biomarkers, 26% were Mayo stage 1, 42% stage 2 and 32% stage 3. There were no significant differences in the demographic and disease characteristics between the three groups but 80% of patients, who started therapy from 2005 to 31/12/2007, received upfront BD, 80% of patients, who started therapy from 1/1/2008 to 31/12/2010, received upfront L and 82% of patients after 1/1/2011 received upfront BDa. On intent to treat, 65% of patients achieved hematologic response to first line therapy, including 20% hemCRs. Hematologic response rates were not different between the three groups (p=0.118); however, hemCRs were more frequent in patients treated before 31/12/2007 and after 1/1/2011 (30% and 27% vs. 9% in those treated from 1/2008-12/2010). The respective hemCR rates for patients treated with B vs. L were 32% vs. 6% (p=0.025). On intent to treat, organ responses were achieved by 28% of patients. Hematologic or organ progression or death has occurred in 60.5% of patients; the median PFS was 10 months and the 1-year PFS rate was 50%, 27% and 59% for patients treated in the three consecutive time periods, respectively (p=0.011). For patients treated upfront with B- vs. L-based regimens the respective 1-year PFS rate was 51% vs. 31% (p=0.054). After progression to first line therapy, 21 (26%) patients received second line therapy: 17 received B and 4 L. The median survival of all patients was 34 months; the 1-year survival rate for patients with Mayo stage 1 disease was 94%, for stage 2 was 56% and for stage 3 was 28% (p<0.001); 18 (22%) patients died within the first 3 months from initiation of therapy (all except one had cardiac involvement). The respective early death rates were 17%, 34% and 4% for patients treated in the three time periods, respectively (p=0.024) and were 22% and 25% for B- and L-based regimens (p=0.443), indicating that the reduction of early deaths was mainly due to the risk-adapted treatment strategy after 1/2011. In conclusion, our data indicate that novel agents, and especially bortezomib, resulted in significant response rates in patients with AL amyloidosis; however, 22% of AL patients die within 3 months form initiation of therapy due cardiac amyloidosis-associated complications. A risk-adapted treatment strategy with bortezomib dose and schedule adjusted according to individual patient characteristics may reduce early mortality and allow patients to achieve a hematologic response. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.

N2  - Objectives: This study sought to evaluate the long-term outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in the Multicenter Canadian Experience study, with special focus on the causes and predictors of late mortality and valve durability. Background: Very few data exist on the long-term outcomes associated with TAVI. Methods: This was a multicenter study including 339 patients considered to be nonoperable or at very high surgical risk (mean age: 81 ± 8 years; Society of Thoracic Surgeons score: 9.8 ± 6.4%) who underwent TAVI with a balloon-expandable Edwards valve (transfemoral: 48%, transapical: 52%). Follow-up was available in 99% of the patients, and serial echocardiographic exams were evaluated in a central echocardiography core laboratory. Results: At a mean follow-up of 42 ± 15 months 188 patients (55.5%) had died. The causes of late death (152 patients) were noncardiac (59.2%), cardiac (23.0%), and unknown (17.8%). The predictors of late mortality were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53 to 3.11), chronic kidney disease (HR: 1.08 for each decrease of 10 ml/min in estimated glomerular filtration rate, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.19), chronic atrial fibrillation (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.03), and frailty (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.07 to 2.17). A mild nonclinically significant decrease in valve area occurred at 2-year follow-up (p < 0.01), but no further reduction in valve area was observed up to 4-year follow-up. No changes in residual aortic regurgitation and no cases of structural valve failure were observed during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Approximately one-half of the patients who underwent TAVI because of a high or prohibitive surgical risk profile had died at a mean follow-up of 3.5 years. Late mortality was due to noncardiac comorbidities in more than one-half of patients. No clinically significant deterioration in valve function was observed throughout the follow-up period. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

N2  - Background: The influence of comorbid conditions on ventricular remodeling, functional status, and clinical outcome after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is insufficiently elucidated. Methods and Results: The influence of different comorbid conditions on left ventricular remodeling, improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, hospitalizations for heart failure, and all-cause mortality after CRT implantation was analyzed in 172 consecutive patients (mean age 71 ± 9 y), implanted from October 2008 to April 2011 in a single tertiary care hospital. During mean follow-up of 18 ± 9 months, 21 patients died and 57 were admitted for heart failure. Left ventricular remodeling and improvement in NYHA functional class were independent from comorbidity burden. However, diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio [HR] 3.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-9.65) and chronic kidney disease (HR 3.11, 95% CI 1.10-8.81) were predictors of all-cause mortality, and the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.02-3.53) was independently associated with heart failure admissions. Importantly, those 3 comorbid conditions had an additive negative impact on survival and heart failure admissions, even in patients with reverse left ventricular remodeling. Conclusions: Reverse ventricular remodeling and improvement in functional status after CRT implantation are independent from comorbidity burden. However, comorbid conditions remain important predictors of all-cause mortality and heart failure admissions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease, including end stage, is more common with increasing age. It most commonly occurs alongside other diseases. There are therefore increasing numbers of older people living with chronic kidney disease alongside their other chronic conditions and the general problems associated with aging. Therefore, the quality of life needs to be a key outcome when considering management and interventions. Guidelines for referral to renal clinics should be followed in order to avoid unnecessary outpatient visits and investigations. Discussions with patients and families about dialysis should include impact on lifestyle and honesty about likely prognosis. For frail patients, there may be no difference in survival rates between those receiving conservative care and those on dialysis. Development of assisted peritoneal dialysis provides the option of home treatment rather than default hospital hemodialysis. Measures of quality and standard of treatment for older people with chronic kidney disease should move away from purely medical targets and include measures of patient outcomes. © 2012 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - Steal syndrome is a feared complication of dialysis vascular access in a population becoming older and frailer. The aim of this study was to determine the predictor factors of steal syndrome. All proximal arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), patent at day 30, inserted between January 2008 and December 2009 were studied. Data on age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM) status, presence of coronary or peripheral artery disease, date of initiation of renal replacement therapy, date of access construction, localization, type of anastomosis, previous interventions, and outcome for AVF and patients were analyzed. There were 324 AVFs placed into 309 individual patients. The mean age was 66.7±15.3 years, and the majority (53.7%) of the patients was male. Mean follow-up of all 324 fistulas was 18.6±8.5 months. During follow-up, steal syndrome occurred in 26 (8%) of the AVFs. Univariate analysis revealed correlations between steal syndrome and DM (P=0.002), brachiomedian fistulas (P=0.016), and side-to-side (STS) anastomosis (P=0.003). However, in multivariate analysis, the presence of DM, STS anastomosis, and female gender were found to be the independent risk factors. The strongest predictive factor was DM (odds ratio: 6.7; 95% confidence interval: 2.5-17.9). Being diabetic is the factor most predictive of having steal syndrome. In diabetic women, with a proximal access, it seems preferable to construct fistulas with end-to-side anastomosis to minimize the risk. © 2012 The Authors.

N2  - Objective: Assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD) is PD with assistance of district nurses educated by the dialysis nurses. The main group of patients needing assisted PD is that of the frail elderly patients, especially those patients who cannot lift the heavy bags of solutions and patients with impaired hearing and vision, as well as decreased physical and mental activity. Since the start of PD in the early 1960s in Europe, Canada, and the USA, many international research findings have been published especially on subjects such as peritonitis rates, quality of life, and costs connected to assisted PD. In 2007 and 2008 research results from Denmark and France showed the importance of continuing education in PD of district nurses, especially in hygiene. Evaluations done by a Dutch quality institute of dialysis showed the same results. Methods: In March 2008 the Dutch project “Thuis in PD Zorg” started with the aim to educate district nurses and to inform home organizations about assisted PD. Delegates of 9 dialysis centers in one of the biggest province in The Netherlands developed a new refresher course for district nurses who already have worked with PD in the past and who need training. It is a 4-hour course starting every 6 weeks. Nurses can sign up via the website THUISINPDZORG.NL, run by persons from the project group. The course is free and is audited by the dialysis nurses of the participating centers. Retraining every year is recommended. Results: Until now (March 2010) 9 persons have been trained and 15 persons have signed up for the course. Evaluations show that district nurses are satisfied with the easy way of signing up and with the content of the course. Home-care organizations are interested and satisfied. Conclusions: Assisted PD is a treatment with advantages for the frail elderly. The continuing course given to district nurses assures that the treatment will stay of high quality. As a side effect we have seen a growth in patients with assisted PD.

N2  - Background: A rebound of cryoglobulins in up to 52% of patients has been reported after Rituximab use in Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinaemia (WM). Recently a few case reports have emerged of post-Rituximab acute CryoGN in WM (2 patients) and in Hep C cryoglobulinaemia (2 patients). Case Report: An 80 year old female was diagnosed with NHL in April 2007. BM trephine demonstrated a monoclonal B cell population (CD19+, CD20+, CD22+, HLA-DR+). IEPG showed IgG-Lambda paraprotein 3 g/L. She was initially treated with Chlorambucil then in late 2008 she was given R-CVP (Rituximab + Cyclophosphamide + Vincristine + Prednisone) and went into excellent remission until Nov 2011. Relapse was associated with splenomegaly and marked intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy. She was given 4 weekly cycles of R-CHOP (Rituximab + Cyclophosphamide + Doxorubicin + Vincristine + Prednisone) In Jan 2012 she presented with fever, rash, diarrhoea, cachexia, and anuric renal failure. She had profound hypocomplementaemia (C3 = 0.49 g/l, C4 = 0.02 g/l), pancytopenia, marked hypogammaglobulinaemia but no paraprotein. Hepatitis B/C serology was negative. RF and cryoglobulins were not detected. Her serum creatinine peaked at 795 umol/l before commencing dialysis. Renal biopsy showed multiple glomerular capillary loops with hyaline PAS+ plugs and focal BM reduplication with minimal cellular proliferation, typical of acute CryoGN. After 2 weeks dialysis urine output spontaneously improved and her serum creatinine ultimately improved to 155 umol/l. She remained frail, bed-bound, developed DVT and died without leaving hospital. Conclusions: This is the first report of CryoGN following Rituximab use in NHL. It is likely that it is an under-recognised cause of acute kidney injury post- Rituximab use in B-lymphocyte proliferative disorders. Monitoring of such patients for a 'flare' of IgMkappa-RF complexes has been suggested. A review of the literature will be presented.

N2  - Background and objectives Peritonitis is the most common infectious complication seen in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Traditionally, exit site infection (ESI) has been thought to predispose PDpatients to peritonitis, although the risks have not been quantified. This study aimed to quantify the risk of PD peritonitis after ESI. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Data from 203 clinically stable PD patients > 18 years of age who were followed as part of a randomized controlled trial over 18 months were used to estimate the risk of developing peritonitis within 30 days of an ESI compared with individuals who did not have a recent ESI. Sensitivity analyses were performed at 15, 45, and 60 days. Results Patientswere mostly male (64.5%) and Caucasian,with amean age of 60.5±14.4 years. Therewere 44 ESIs and 87 peritonitis episodes during the 18-month study. Seven patients had an ESI followed by peritonitis within 30 days. Using a frailty model, patients who had an ESI had a significantly higher risk of developing peritonitis within 30 days, even if the ESI was appropriately treated. This risk was maximal early on and diminished with time, with hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 11.1 at 15 days (HR=11.1, 95% CI=4.9-25.1), 5.3 at 45 days (2.5-11.3), and 4.9 at 60 days (2.4-9.9). In 2.3% of patients, subsequent peritonitis was caused by the same organism as the previous ESI. Conclusions A strong association between a treated ESI and subsequent PD peritonitis was present up to 60 days after initial diagnosis. © 2012 by the American Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Objectives: The objective of this pilot study was to determine if frailty predicts surgical complications among elderly women undergoing gynecologic oncology procedures. Methods: A cohort of gynecologic oncology patients age ≥ 65, undergoing surgery between March and December 2011 was identified. Frailty was evaluated using a validated assessment tool. The primary outcome measure was 30 day postoperative complication rate. Results: Forty women were approached for study entry and 37 (92%) enrolled. The mean age was 73 years (range 65-95). The majority of women had a malignancy and underwent a major abdominal surgical procedure. Twenty-one women (57%) were not frail, 10 (27%) were intermediately frail and 6 (16%) were frail. There was no difference in age or prevalence of medical comorbidities between groups. Frail women had a significantly higher BMI compared to intermediately frail and not frail women, (36.0, 31.5 and 26.1 kg/m2, p = 0.02). The rate of 30-day surgical complications increased with frailty score and was 24%, versus 67% for women who were not frail as compared to the frail (p = 0.04). Conclusions: Pre-operative frailty assessment is well accepted by gynecologic oncology patients and feasible in a clinic setting. Frail women had a higher BMI, indicating that low body weight is not a marker for frailty, and had a significantly higher rate of 30-day postoperative complications in this pilot study. Initial findings support the concept of measuring frailty as a possible predictor for postoperative morbidity that will allow for improved patient counseling and decision making. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Prescribing medicines for older patients is more challenging than prescribing for younger adults as there is less room for error. The physiological changes associated with ageing have important consequences for the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Water-soluble drugs are cleared more slowly with increasing age by virtue of reduced functioning nephrons. In contrast, lipid-soluble drugs are cleared more slowly via hepatic metabolism and are distributed into a larger volume of distribution as a result of the physiological reduction in body water. This results in two separate mechanisms via which the elimination half-life is prolonged. These changes need to be considered together with the changes in pharmacodynamics seen with increasing age. In addition, a number of characteristic changes are seen in the presence of organ disease such as cardiac failure or chronic kidney disease. Finally, the prevalence of frailty rises dramatically with increasing age and is associated with changes over and above those seen as a result of age alone. Reductions in protein binding and consequent increases in volume of distribution and elimination half-life, as well as reduced hepatic enzyme activity are seen in frail elderly patients. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Background: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases with age. Older patients have lower lean muscle mass and therefore using serum creatinine alone as marker of renal function can lead to underdiagnosis of CKD. Objective: The aim of this study was to review the prevalence of CKD amongst a cohort of elderly patients with normal serum creatinine. Methods: Doctot application on the smartphone was used to calculate eGFR in a cohort of patients over 65 years with a normal serum creatinine on admission. 40 patients were included. This application is based on the MDRD formula (includes age, sex, ethnicity and serum creatinine). Patients were then classed into the various stages of CKD. Results: Of the 40 patients reviewed, 35 had renal disease. Interestingly, only 5 had a diagnosis of renal impairment recorded in the medical notes. 20 of the 35 patients had stage 1 CKD and the other 15 had stage 2 CKD. 18 of the 35 patients with renal impairment especially stage 2, were found to be frail females over 75 years. This group also had a number of co-morbidities including diabetes and hypertension. Conclusion: eGFR is better than serum creatinine alone for assessment of renal function in the elderly. It is important not only for diagnosis but also for appropriate medical investigation and drug prescribing. As the MDRD formula excludes BMI, further research is warranted to compare measurement of eGFR using MDRD formula with The Cockcroft and Gault equation in this older population.

N2  - Background. Incidence rates of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) vary geographically not only between but within countries. This study uses data from the French REIN registry to quantify the extent to which socio-economic environment, health care supply and medical practice patterns such as early dialysis initiation or greater propensity to accept frail or elderly patients for dialysis, may explain spatial patterns of ESRD incidence in 85 French districts.Methods.The association between age-and sex-adjusted incidence rates of RRT in 2008-09 and 17 indicators was explored at the district level with geographically appropriate methods, before and after controlling for the effects of diabetes and the other significant indicators. Rate ratios (RR) and credible intervals (CI) were estimated for a 1-SD increase of each covariate.Results.Crude RRT incidence by district ranged from 85.8 to 225.5 per million inhabitants. The age-and sex-adjusted RRT incidence increased with the proportion of people unemployed (RR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09), the population density (RR: 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.12) and the prevalence of diabetes (RR: 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.12). It also increased with the proportions of incident ESRD patients >85 years (RR: 1.02, 95% CI 0.99-1.06), of deaths within the first 3 months of RRT (RR: 1.03, 95% CI 1.0-1.06) and of nephrologists in private practice (RR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08) and with the median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis initiation (RR: 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.09).Conclusion.This study confirms that socio-economic factors and diabetes explain substantial between-area variations in RRT incidence and highlights the variability of practice patterns, especially decisions about RRT and their potential impact on incidence. © 2012 The Author.

N2  - Frailty is a physiological vulnerability status of the patient which is associated with the increased number of hospitalization and death. To evaluate the prevalence of frailty and its associated factors in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on conservative treatment (CT), hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Frailty was assessed in 146 patients (86 CT, 37 HD and 23 PD) and characterized as muscle weakness and exhaustion--by the physical aspect and vitality domains, respectively, evaluated in the SF-36 quality of life instrument; physical inactivity--if he or she answered "never" or "hardly ever" when asked about physical activity; and as unintentional weight loss (> 4.5 kg per year). Patients were divided into three groups: non-fragile (NF), pre-fragile (PF) and fragile (F). The demographic, clinical and laboratory data were extracted from patient charts. Frailty was diagnosed in 36% of patients on CT, 37.8% in HD and 47.8% in PD. It was characterized in 36.8% of patients aged between 20 and 40 years and 40.3% of those between 41 and 60 years. Frailty was significantly associated with the use of vitamin D (r = 0.16; p = 0.03), hemoglobin (r = -0.14; p = - 0.02) and intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.16; p = 0.03). Frailty is common among patients with CKD on conservative treatment and dialysis, even in those who are not elderly. In the patients studied, the phenotype of frailty was associated with no usage of vitamin D, lower serum levels of hemoglobin and higher levels of parathyroid hormone.

N2  - ESRD has become an important problem for elderly patients. The segment of the ESRD population age 65 years or older has grown considerably, and this growth is expected to accelerate in coming years. Nephrologists caring for the elderly with advanced kidney disease will encounter patients with comorbid conditions common in younger patients, as well as physical, psychological, and social challenges that occur with increased frequency in the aging population. These challenging factors must be addressed to help inform decisions regarding the option to initiate dialysis, the choice of dialysismodality,whether to pursue kidney transplantation, and end-of-life care. This article will highlight some common problems encountered by elderly patients with ESRD and review data on the clinical outcomes of elderly patients treatedwith differentmodalities of dialysis, outcomes of kidney transplantation in the elderly, and nondialytic management of CKD stage 5. © 2012 by the American Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Contemporary Japan is known both for its high tech culture and its rapidly aging population, with 22 % of people currently 65 years and older. Yet there has been little attention to the material culture of the elderly. This paper explores the way aging bodies, official ideology, and consumption of what are called "assistive devices" and "life technologies" come together in the experience of frail old people who depend not only on human caregivers but on "things" such as walkers, kidney dialysis machines, and electric massage chairs. It begins to consider the questions: What technology to aid failing bodies is available, and to whom? How does the advocacy of independence create new forms of consumption? How do "things" mediate ideological change regarding elder care and help to create new understandings of self and one's relation to others? Data come from interviews conducted in 2003-2007 as part of a study of elder care in Japan under the public long term care insurance system that began in 2000. These interviews point both to acceptance of the technology as a way to avoid over-dependence on caregivers, and to resistance to the limitations of aging and to its 21st century definition by the state. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Background and Aims. The tolerability of 5-azacytidine allow its use in frail and/or elderly patients who comprise the majority of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) population. Nevertheless, despite the increased incidence of renal impairment (RI) in older individuals, patients with RI were not included in the approval trials. As a result, the optimal use of 5-azacytidine in patients with RI is currently unknown. Only one single center, retrospective study addressed the efficacy and toxicity of 5-azacytidine in patients with RI, but no comparative analysis between patients with or without RI has been performed yet. (Figure presented) Methods. We retrospectively analyzed 41 IPSS intermediate-2 and high-risk MDS patients (30 male, 11 female) with a median age of 73. 5 (range 55-81) years. Patients were classified according to WHO as RAEB-II (n=18), AML/MDS (n=5), CMML-II (n=8), MDS/MPN (n=4), RAEB-I (n=3) and RCMD (n=3). All patients had bilirubin level <2mg/dl, 11 (27%) had RI not requiring dialysis with median GFR 45 ml/min (range 22. 3-55, RI group) and 30 had median GFR 91 ml/min (73-140, non-RI group) as assessed by using the MRDM or the Cockroft-Gault formulas depending on patient's weight. Median follow up and number of completed cycles for all patients were 8. 6 months and 5(1-26), respectively. In all patients 5-azacytidine was started at 75mg/m2 SC for 7 days on 28-day cycles. Response to therapy and toxicity were evaluated using the IWG 2006 and NCI-CTC criteria, respectively. Significance of differences was assessed by Mann-Whitney U-test, Chi square or Fisher Exact tests as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used for survival analysis. Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time from first 5- azacytidine administration to leukemic transformation or death. Results are presented as median values. Results. Patients with RI were significantly older than the non-RI ones (median age 76 vs 70, respectively, p=0. 004) and exhibited a trend for higher treatment discontinuation rate (54. 5% vs 23. 3%, respectively, p=0. 057). By contrast, no differences regarding gender, MDS subtype, transfusion needs and cytogenetics were noticed among the two groups. Likewise, patients with or without RI completed similar number of cycles (5 vs 7, respectively, p=0. 13) and displayed comparable rates of overall (not reached vs 14 months, p=0. 8) and event-free (10. 9 months vs 9,5 months, p=0. 8) survival (Figure 1), overall response (54. 5% vs 60. 7%, p=0. 9), dose adjustment (27. 3% vs 31%, p=0. 8), bleeding (45. 5% vs 38%, p=0. 8), infections (81% vs 72%, p=0. 73), days of hospitalization (14 vs 19. 5 p=0. 35) and grades 3-4 neutropenia (p=0. 14) and thrombocytopenia (p=0. 16). Renal function transiently deteriorated during the first 2 cycles, but then improved in 5/11 (45%) of patients with RI and 4/30 (13%) of non-RI group. Notably, adding the latter patients in the RI group did not alter the results of the comparisons. Conclusions. We conclude that 5-azacytidine is effective and safe in patients with moderate renal impairment who thus should be treated in a similar manner to patients with normal renal function. Transient decline in renal function may be observed in patients either with or without RI, but does not appear to affect the outcome.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in older patients ( pts) is a complication that impacts morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, its association with acuity of illness at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, presence of comorbidities and pre-hospital functional status has not been previously described. Methods: A total of 100 elderly pts. admitted to the ICU between September/2011 and January/2012 were prospectively evaluated for AKI, defined as an increase in serum creatinine (SCr) > 0.3 mg/dL over baseline value in 48 hours, according to AKIN definition. Univariate analysis was used to study ICU admission parameters associated with AKI development during ICU stay. The severity of acute physiological derangement at ICU admission was assessed with SAPS 3 Score, the presence of co-morbidities with Charlson Comorbidity Index and functional status with VES-13 Score. Goodness of fit and discrimination of the three severity scores evaluated for AKI were calculated with Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) and area under the ROC curve (AUC ROC), respectively. Results: AKI incidence was 28 % (n=28), with a mortality rate of 35,7% (n=10), compared to 11% (n=8) for non-AKI pts. The mean age of all pts. was 75,4 ± 8.2 y/o and 48% (n=48) were male. Post-operative (36%) and sepsis (23%) were the major reasons for admission at the ICU. At univariate analysis, the following variables at ICU admission were significantly associated with AKI development during ICU stay: serum potassium (4.4 mEq/L, 3.6-5 vs 3.9 mEq/L, 3.6-4.3; p=0.02), baseline SCr (2 mg/dL, 0.9-3.2 vs 1.1 mg/dL, 0.9-1.4; p=0.001), hemoglobin (10.2 g/dL, 9.2-12.8 vs 12 g/dL, 10.9-13; p=0.03), age (78.5 y/o, 72.2-84.7 vs 74 y/o, 67-81; p=0.03), systolic blood pressure (140 mmHg, 121-155 vs 121 mmHg, 92.5-148; p=0.01), unplanned ICU admission (38% vs 17.4%; p=0.02), diabetes (52% vs 19%; p=0.001), low cardiac output (53.6% vs 18.3%; p=0.0001), heart failure (83.3% vs 24.7%; p=0.002) and acute infection (57% vs 23.5%; p=0.01). The AUC ROC for SAPS III, Charlson and VES-13 Scores were 0.73, 0.68 and 0.66, respectively and the HL p values were 0.73, 0.68 and 0.66, respectively. Variables previously thought to be indicative of a poor prognosis for the elderly, such as functional status, institutionalization and frailty (Figure Presented) were not predictive of AKI. Conclusions: AKI is frequent in critically ill elderly pts. and is associated with a high mortality. AKI incidence can be better estimated by evaluation of the acute organ dysfunctions at ICU admission than by the presence of comorbidities or pre-hospital functional status.

N2  - Frailty is a state of high vulnerability and adverse health outcomes in the elderly. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), frailty is also predictive of poor outcomes, but, interestingly, it is not exclusive of aged patients. In this study we assessed the prevalence of frailty and its associated risk factors in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis. Sixty one patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 were assessed for frailty defined by the presence of ≥3 of the following abnormalities: muscle weakness by physical domain and weakness by the vital domain of the SF-36 assessment the Quality of Life; exhaustion; physical inactivity, if the patient answered “never” or “almost never” when asked about physical activity; and unintentional weight loss more than 4.5 kg in the last year. The patients were categorized as not frail, pre-frail and frail. Besides the clinical and laboratory data, the following variables were assessed: Flow mediated vasodilatation (as a marker of endothelial dysfunction), bone densitometry, 6 minutes walking test, and grip strength (hand grip). Frailty was diagnosed in 36.1% of the patients, and pre-frailty in 44.3%. Among the patients with CKD and frailty, 50% were not elderly. Exhaustion and physical inactivity were more frequent among the frail patients compared to the pre-frail ones. The following variables were significantly associated with frailty in CKD patients: Exhaustion (r= 0.53; p= 0.000); Weakness (r= 0.77; p= 0,000); Physical inactivity (r= -0.60; p= 0,000); Parathyroid hormone (r= 0.25; p= 0,04); Intravenous iron administration (r= -0.26; p= 0,04); and Flow mediated vasodilation (r= -0.33; p= 0,009). In conclusion, frailty was diagnosed in 36% of our patients, half of whom were not elderly. The high prevalence and early occurrence of frailty in CKD might be due to shared mechanisms to both syndromes.

N2  - Background: In 2008, there were 110, 000 incident cases of ESRD, of which the fastest growing group are patients ages 65+. Many ESRD patients are placed on aggressive hemodialysis (HD) treatment, regardless of their comorbidities. Patients with ESRD experience high symptom burden, even when compared with other chronic, debilitating conditions, and HD itself can be associated with side effects (e. g. excess blood volume removal causing fatigue). This project investigated which symptoms are deemed most burdensome by HD patients and whether some symptoms may be related to HD treatment. Method: Participants were recruited from two outpatient dialysis clinics in New York City. All patients were receiving HD and categorized as “frail” (i. e. ineligible for transplant) by their treating nephrologist. Other eligibility criteria included fluency in English and intact cognition. Participants were interviewed using the Dialysis Symptom Index (DSI) and the MOS SF-36. Chart reviews identified comorbidity using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Results: Of the 31 participants enrolled as of 12/1/11, the mean age is 71 (range 44-89); 39% are female and the mean CCI Score is 6. 4 (range 1-15). Patients reported a mean of 14 symptoms of the 30 that were asked. Symptoms with high prevalence were Feeling Tired or Lack of Energy (90%), Dry Skin (70%), Trouble Staying Asleep (65%), and Nausea (48%). Results of Worrying (61%) and Feeling Sad (58%) within the past week suggest high rates of depression. When asked which symptoms were felt to be HD treatment related, the most common responses were Feeling Tired or a Lack of Energy (93%), Muscle Cramps (90%), Feeling Anxious (77%) and Lightheadedness (67%). Our sample demonstrated higher symptom burden when compared with a general HD population1, with double-digit differences in prevalence of 20 symptoms, the most prominent being Feeling Sad (58% vs. 30%), Dry Skin (70% vs. 42%) and Dyspnea (48% vs. 21%). Conclusion: Frail ESRD patients receiving HD experience immense symptom burden, even when compared to the general HD population, and patients attributed many symptoms to HD itself. Many of the symptoms may be reduced by modifying treatment (e. g. reducing the time spent in HD). These pilot data support future efforts to investigate palliative care interventions in this target population.

N2  - Background: The risk of herpes zoster in the dialysis population relative to the general population is not known. The aim of this study was to perform a population-based cohort study to investigate the risk of herpes zoster after the initiation of hemodialysis therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Taiwan, a country with the highest incidence of ESRD in the world. Study Design: Matched cohort study. Setting & Participants: Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. 843 patients who were beginning hemodialysis therapy in 1999-2003 were included as the study cohort and 3,372 patients without ESRD matched for age and sex were included as a comparison cohort. A multivariate frailty Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to adjust for confounding and compare the 6-year herpes zosterfree survival rate between these 2 cohorts. Predictors: Hemodialysis. Outcomes: Herpes zoster. Results: Mean years of follow-up were 4.73 and 5.49 for the hemodialysis and comparison cohorts, respectively. 868 patients developed herpes zoster throughout the study period, 294 from the hemodialysis cohort and 574 from the comparison cohort. The incidence rate of herpes zoster (73.34 events/1,000 person-year) was significantly higher in the hemodialysis cohort than in the control cohort (31.03 events/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for potential confounders, the adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.72-2.27). Limitations: We expect that some patients with mild zoster chose not to seek medical help. Conclusions: We conclude that patients treated with long-term hemodialysis are at an increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population. © 2012 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

N2  - Background: Frail and polypathological patients (PP) are often undertreated with evidence-based cardiovascular drugs, as their benefits are uncertain in this population. Objectives: To determine the effects of treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers/inhibitors (ACEI/ARB), statins and/or beta-blockers on survival rates and functional decline in PP with evidence-based clinical indications for treatment with any of these drug families. Method: Prospective observational multicentre cohort study with a 12-month follow-up period. We selected PP with any condition of the following: chronic heart failure, coronary heart disease, chronic renal disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus with any visceral involvement, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. Clinical, functional (Barthel index), socio-familial risk data and drug prescriptions were measured at baseline. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models were used to identify variables independently associated with survival and functional decline. Results: The analysis included 1260 PP. The mean age was 79 ± 9.5 years. The mortality rate was 34.5%. Statin (aHR 0.671; P = 0.001), beta-blocker plus statin (aHR 0.645; P = 0.007), ACEI/ARB plus statin (aHR 0.680; P = 0.002), or combined ACEI/ARB plus statin plus beta-blocker (aHR 0.541; P = 0.000) prescriptions were associated with longer survival times. Additionally, PP whose Barthel index was ≥ 60 showed a lower risk of disability progression if treated with statins (aOR = 0.476; P = 0.000), or their combinations, mainly with ACEI/ARB plus beta-blockers (aOR 0.563; P = 0.031). Conclusions: The prescription of statins, alone or in combination with other drugs, may impact the survival and functional decline in polypathological patients. Further prospective blinded randomised assays are needed to confirm these observations. © 2011 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

N2  - Case Presentation: A 58-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department with a three-month history of worsening dyspnea, productive cough, low-grade fevers and chills. Past medical history was significant for 60 pack year smoking history, paranoid schizophrenia and end stage renal disease currently receiving hemodialysis. On physical exam, patient was afebrile, hypotensive with an oxygen saturation of 96%, frail with overall poor hygiene, in moderate distress with decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion on the right side. Patient also had significant left upper extremity swelling. Chest x-ray revealed a massive right pleural effusion. Patient was (Figure presented) admitted to the hospital and antibiotics were started for possible pneumonia. He then underwent thoracentesis, and the obtained pleural fluid showed an elevated triglyceride level of 693 mg/dl indicating chylothorax. Furthermore, a CT chest showed right pleural effusion, a small left pleural effusion, spiculated mass within the anterolateral aspect of the right lung, occlusion of the superior vena cava with collateralization, and extensive mediastinal and axillary adenopathy. However, video assisted thoracoscopy was performed which did not show any mass lesions. After a week into the admission, patient had continued respiratory distress and underwent bronchoscopy with transbronchial lung biopsy and lavage. No obstruction, lesions, or ulcerations were visualized in the bronchial segments. Bronchial wash was negative for gram stain, acid fast bacilli and Pneumocyctis (Figure presented) Carinii organisms. The pathology of the bronchial wash showed bacteria with morphologic features of actinomyces, RBC's and acute inflammation. Discussion: The patient presented with massive right-sided pleural effusion and adenopathy. Pleural fluid analysis was consistent with chylothorax, which is an indication of disruption of lymphatic flow usually due to malignancy, lymphoma or trauma. Diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis in the patient was based on histologic examination. Actinomyces has propensity to extend across fissures and invade the chest wall. In this patient, actinomyces caused bronchopulmonary infection and chest wall disease by disruption of lymphatic flow resulting in chylothorax, and the SVC occlusion. Conclusions: Awareness of this rare disease and its clinical presentation is important for hospitalist. It is usually unsuspected and under diagnosed due to lack of familiarity and failure to culture or culture appropriately this microaerophilic bacterium.

N2  - Frailty is associated with a pro-inflammatory state, which has been characterized by elevated levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers, but has not been related to the number of co-existing chronic diseases associated with inflammation. We sought to determine the extent to which a higher number of inflammatory-related diseases is associated with frailty and to identify the most common disease patterns associated with being frail in older adults. We performed binomial regression analyses to assess whether a higher count of inflammatory-related diseases increases the probability of frailty using data from the WHAS I and II, companion cohorts composed of 70-79-year-old community-dwelling older women in Baltimore, Maryland (n= 620). An increase of one inflammatory-related disease was associated log-linearly with frailty (Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 2.28, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.81-2.87). After adjusting for age, race, education, and smoking status, the probability of frailty remained significant (PR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.52-2.55). In the frail population, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and depressive symptoms (Prevalence = 22.9%, 95%CI = 14.2-34.8%); CVD and depressive symptoms (21.7%, 95%CI = 13.2-33.5%); CKD and anemia (18.7%, 95%CI = 11.1-29.7%); cardiovascular disease (CVD), CKD, and pulmonary disease (10.7%, 95%CI = 5.2-21.0%); CKD, anemia, and depressive symptoms (8.7%, 95%CI = 3.9-18.2%); and CVD, anemia, pulmonary disease, and depressive symptoms (5.0%, 95%CI = 1.6-14.4%) were among the most frequent disease combinations. Their prevalence percentages were significantly higher in the frail versus non-frail women. A higher inflammatory-related disease count, perhaps reflecting a greater pro-inflammatory burden, increases the likelihood of frailty. Shared mechanisms among specific disease combinations may further contribute to this risk. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background: Current literature suggests that nocturnal home hemodialysis (NHD) has several clinical advantages. However, selection for NHD leans toward healthier patients. An analysis of the outcomes for dependent vs. independent NHD patients may help us determine the feasibility of extending NHD to frail patients. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of all consecutive NHD patients from 01/1995 to 03/2011 (date of last follow-up was 07/2011). The primary outcome of this study was time to first hospitalization or technique failure for dependent vs. independent patients. Dependency was defined as reliance on a caregiver for the management of all or part of NHD therapy. Secondary outcomes included hospitalization rate and hospital days. Results: One hundred forty-nine NHD patients were included, 49 (33%) were dependent. Baseline characteristics and secondary outcomes are noted below. There was no difference in the primary outcome for dependent vs. independent patients (HR 1.422, 95% CI 0.914- 2.213, P = 0.125). (Table Presented) Conclusion: NHD is feasible in dependent patients.

N2  - Background: For chronic hemodialysis, the ideal permanent vascular access is the arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Temporary catheters should be reserved for acute dialysis needs. The AVF is associated with lower infection rates, better clinical results, and a higher quality of life and survival when compared to temporary catheters. In Brazil, the proportion of patients with temporary catheters for more than 3 months from the beginning of therapy is used as an evaluation of the quality of renal units. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated with the time between the beginning of hemodialysis with temporary catheters and the placement of the first arteriovenous fistula in Brazil. Methods. This is an observational, prospective non-concurrent study using national administrative registries of all patients financed by the public health system who began renal replacement therapy (RRT) between 2000 and 2004 in Brazil. Incident patients were eligible who had hemodialysis for the first time. Patients were excluded who: had hemodialysis reportedly started after the date of death (inconsistent database); were younger than 18 years old; had HIV; had no record of the first dialysis unit; and were dialyzed in units with less than twenty patients. To evaluate individual and renal unit factors associated with the event of interest, the frailty model was used (N = 55,589). Results: Among the 23,824 patients (42.9%) who underwent fistula placement in the period of the study, 18.2% maintained the temporary catheter for more than three months until the fistula creation. The analysis identified five statistically significant factors associated with longer time until first fistula: higher age (Hazard-risk - HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00); having hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.98) as the cause of chronic renal disease; residing in capitals cities (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95) and certain regions in Brazil - South (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.8-0.87), Midwest (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94), Northeast (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94), or North (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94) and the type of renal unit (public or private). Conclusion: Monitoring the provision of arteriovenous fistulas in renal units could improve the care given to patients with end stage renal disease. © 2011 Bonfante et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - There is an ongoing increase in the number of elderly or frail patients requiring renal replacement therapy. Assisted automated peritoneal dialysis (aAPD) is one treatment option for this patient group and is becoming increasingly recognized as a distinct dialysis modality. In this article, we review the current status of aAPD and its evolution across Europe, describing the differences in service provision. We also report our experience locally of outcomes on our aAPD population over the last 4 years. We found that aAPD is a viable dialysis modality in the frail and elderly with limited lifespan, and complications of peritoneal dialysis are perhaps lower than would be expected in this population. This form of therapy also avoids the disruption to life which results from hospital-based dialysis. © 2011 The Author.

N2  - Background-For the large and growing population of elderly patients with cardiovascular disease, it is important to identify clinically relevant measures of biological age and their contribution to risk. Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine denoting increased vulnerability and decreased physiological reserves. We analyzed the manner in which the variable frailty predicts short-term outcomes for elderly non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients. Methods and Results-Patients aged â‰¥ 75 years, with diagnosed non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were included at 3 centers, and clinical data including judgment of frailty were collected prospectively. Frailty was defined according to the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale. The impact of the comorbid conditions on risk was quantified by the coronary artery disease-specific index. Of 307 patients, 149 (48.5%) were considered frail. By multiple logistic regression, frailty was found to be strongly and independently associated with risk for the primary composite outcome (death from any cause, myocardial reinfarction, revascularization due to ischemia, hospitalization for any cause, major bleeding, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and need for dialysis up to 1 month after inclusion) (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.7), in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-16.8), and 1-month mortality (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-13.0). Conclusions-Frailty is strongly and independently associated with in-hospital mortality, 1-month mortality, prolonged hospital care, and the primary composite outcome. The combined use of frailty and comorbidity may constitute an ultimate risk prediction concept in regard to cardiovascular patients with complex needs. © 2011 American Heart Association.

N2  - Background. Twenty-five to 30% of new renal replacement therapy (RRT) patients present late to renal services. The proportion in whom this is avoidable, and whether awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has reduced its incidence is not known.Methods. Adult patients starting RRT (2003-2008) in a single unit were grouped according to the time interval between first presentation to the unit and start of RRT: <90 days (late presenters); 90-364 days; ≥365 days. 'Late presenters' were classified as follows: acute kidney injury - patients who had acute but irreversible renal failure; 'avoidable' late referrals, if they had known pre-existing CKD and 'unavoidable' late referrals, if they had unpredictable rapid progression of their CKD or had no prior contact with health care. Mortality risk associated with late presentation was explored using multivariable Cox regression.Results. Late presentation was common (24.3%) but late referrals accounted for only 7.4% and 3.9% were avoidable. The incidence of late referrals decreased from 9.2% in 2003-2005 to 5.5% in 2006-2008 (trend P = 0.07). Late presentation was associated with increased mortality after adjusting for comorbidity, transplantation and permanent vascular access, and the majority of late presenters died due to malignancy or withdrawal of RRT.Conclusions. The lower incidence of late referrals and the falling trend could be due to implementation of automated estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting and the increased awareness of CKD in primary care. Future prospective studies are needed to examine the extent to which frailty contributes to this mortality risk. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.

N2  - Elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk of developing aging-related problems, such as frailty, impaired physical function, falls, poor nutrition and cognitive impairment. These factors affect dialysis outcomes, which can be very poor in frail, elderly patients who often experience a decline in overall health and physical function and have short survival. The default treatment option for these patients is hospital-based hemodialysis, often with little consideration of how this modality will affect the survival or quality of life of individual patients. A comparison of quality of life of elderly patients on hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis shows that those on peritoneal dialysis have less illness intrusion. Assisted peritoneal dialysis enables a greater number of frail, elderly patients to have dialysis in their own homes. Dialysis may not extend survival for those with multiple comorbidities, so conservative care (nondialysis treatment) should be considered. To improve the outcomes of elderly patients with ESRD, it is necessary to develop a realistic approach to overall prognosis, quality of life and how the patient copes with the disabilities associated with aging. This approach includes having discussions regarding choice of treatment and end-of-life goals with patients and families. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

N2  - The global population is aging, and the number of people above the age of 85 years is growing faster than any other age group. There is an age-related decline in kidney function; however, not all individuals will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) with advancing age. Those who are genetically predisposed and exposed to lifetime cardiovascular risk factors are likely to develop systemic atherosclerosis and CKD as a part of its manifestation. CKD promotes poor health through its association with inflammation and oxidative stress. Malnutrition, weight loss and sarcopenia are common in CKD patients, leading to poor outcomes, such as physical and cognitive dysfunction, manifesting as major geriatric syndromes. Frailty is likely to be one of the underlying processes that leads to the clinical manifestations of geriatric syndromes in patients with CKD. Therefore, functional outcomes, such as cognition and physical functioning, might be more relevant outcomes to older patients with CKD. Interventions should be developed and assessed in terms of maintaining quality rather than quantity of life before disability develops. © 2011 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - Background: Elderly patients contribute increasingly to the kidney recipient patient pool and they show favourable outcomes concerning renal graft survival. It could be shown that graft survival itself, was not negatively influenced by evolving patient age and that older patients seem to derive a survival benefit from transplantation compared to those remaining on dialysis treatment. There are several reports in the literature dealing with quality of life assessment as well as functional ability of elderly patients on haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Little is known about functionality and social integration of old kidney transplant recipients so far. Method: In a prospective single-center cohort analysis 121 renal kidney transplant reciepients (> 60 years) underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment (ADL, CCT, TUG, GDS-15, MNA, vigorimetry). Frailty index was then determined by the Cardiovascular Health Scale (CHS Frailty index). Results: In total 70 men and 51 women were recruited. Mean duration from transplantation was 8.3±6.1 years (male 7.6±4.9/female 8.5±5.9). The overall prevalence of frailty was 9.9% (male 11,3, female 10.9). 21.9% were considered to be pre-frail (male 22.7/female 15.6). Frailty index war significantly correlated to numer of drugs prescribed (p=0,001) as well as number of chronic concimittant conditions (p=0,001). Personal well-being as indicated by GDS-15 was attributed to somatic and health associated functionality. Conclusion: One fifth of the recipients tend to develop a functional decline. This observation positively correlates wit co-morbidities and number of drugs prescribed. Nephrologists have to bear in mind that improvement of prescription methods in elderly renal transplant recipients may not only have an impact not only on course of disease but also on functional properties of their patients.

N2  - Objective. Recruitment is one of the most serious challenges in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), especially in the old and frail population. A Norwegian multicentre RCT targeting end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients older than 70 years was initiated to compare the impact on quality of life of early or late start of dialysis. Owing to poor inclusion the RCT was closed. The aim of the present study was to explore possible reasons for the recruitment failure. Material and methods. A questionnaire was distributed to all Norwegian nephrologists. The questionnaire presented 11 statements which cited possible reasons for not including elderly ESRD patients in the RCT in question. Results. The highest rated reasons for non-inclusion were the physician's wish to decide the timing of dialysis individually and the patient's wish to postpone the start of treatment. High mean scores were also found for reasons related to workload and capacity at the dialysis unit, whereas the influence of the doctorpatient relationship and competing studies were judged not to be important. Conclusions. The results indicate that confidence in individually decided treatment and fear of losing professional autonomy make Norwegian nephrologists reluctant to include patients in RCTs. To succeed in recruitment, there seems to be a need for cultural changes as well as increased resources to meet practical challenges. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.

N2  - Background: detecting chronic kidney disease (CKD) may have important implications for the management of older and frail people. We aimed at investigating whether clinical setting (nursing home: NH versus hospital: H) affects the agreement between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values estimated by Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), Cockcroft-Gault (CG) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equations. Design: observational study. Setting: comparison between NH residents and H patients. Subjects: we used data from 177 NH residents, and 439 H patients. Methods: the agreement between estimating equations and the odds of a discrepancy >25% between formulas in relation to setting (NH versus H) were investigated. Results: the agreement between MDRD and CKD-EPI formulas was good either in NH (k = 0.82) or H (k = 0.87) patients, while corresponding figures for CG indicate only a fair agreement with CKD-EPI (k = 0.50 for both populations). Setting (NH versus H) was associated with discordance between MDRD and CKD-EPI (OR = 3.97; 95% CI = 1.75-9.01), but not between CG and EPI (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.87-1.81). Conclusions: in NH residents, MDRD and CKD-EPI formulas yield highly concordant GFR values, but CG behaves differently in up to one-third of patients. Such findings have important implications in dosing drugs cleared by the kidney. Setting should be taken into consideration in studies for validation of GFR equations. © The Author 2011.

N2  - The numbers of older patients requiring dialysis therapy is rising, reflecting the ageing of the general population. Older dialysis patients have a tendency to present later for dialysis, have a higher number of comorbid conditions, are at higher risk of cognitive dysfunction and have increased levels of frailty. These are all barriers to home dialysis therapy so hospital haemodialysis (HD) is the predominant dialysis modality for older patients. Evidence suggests, however, that home treatment with peritoneal dialysis (PD) intrudes less into the life of older patients than hospital HD. Assisted PD is available in some countries and this enables more older patients to be treated in their own homes. Adjustments to patient education also need to be made to accommodate the barriers to learning and decision-making that often exist in older people. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - As people age and live for longer they are more likely to develop comorbid conditions including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This paper discusses the treatment options for stage 5 CKD including haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, transplantation or conservative management, also known as supportive care, for those who decide not to undertake dialysis. It also highlights the complexity of offering a treatment such as dialysis, viewed as a requirement to prolong life, without which people will die, which is unable to restore the kidneys to normal function, only substitute for. Dialysis is also an arduous therapy known to shorten life. In the past refusal of dialysis was viewed as akin to suicide and it is not until more recently that the needs and experiences of those who decide not to embark on dialysis have started to be recognized. Clearly dialysis is not suitable for all, particularly those who are frail with multiple comorbidities and so supportive and palliative care may be a more suitable option for some.

N2  - Background: Frailty is common in older adults but its association with health status (patients' symptoms, function and quality of life) is unknown. Methods: We prospectively recruited patients ≥65 years (n = 629) who underwent PCI at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) and Franciscan Skemp Hospital (LaCrosse, WI) and survived until hospital discharge (10/2005 to 09/2008) to assess for frailty and health status. Frailty status was determined based on deficits due to weight loss, exhaustion, physical activity, gait speed, and grip strength (≥3 features = frail; 1-2 features = intermediate frailty; 0 features = not frail) and compared with comorbidities and health status [Short-Form 36 (SF-36) and Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ)]. A multivariable linear regression model was used to estimate the association of frailty with health status. Results: Of 629 patients, 117 (19%) were frail, 298 (47%) had intermediate frailty, and 130 were not frail (21%). Incomplete data precluded classification in 84 patients (13%). Frail patients had higher rates than non-frail patients of hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, prior stroke, and prior myocardial infarction (p <0.05 for each comparison), including more prevalent left main or multivessel disease (p<0.05). Multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, sex, and comorbid illnesses demonstrated poorer health status in PCI-treated patients with any frailty (Figure). Frail patients reported lower general (SF-36) and disease-specific (SAQ) health status than non-frail patients, with estimated effect sizes 1.8 to 8.8 times greater than the impact of a 10-year increase in age. Conclusions: One-fifth of older patients referred for PCI are frail and frailty is associated with greater comorbidity and poorer health status. Frailty may add a new dimension to risk prediction in the elderly and its assessment should be incorporated into risk stratification. Graph Presented.

N2  - Introduction: Cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis is an uncommon cause of stroke. It is characterized by cerebral edema and hemorrhagic extravasation in the affected territory. It is poorly described in the geriatric population. Case Report: An 85 year old female was transferred from a long term care facility to the hospital because of confusion and lethargy. She has a past medical history of dementia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, stroke with residual left hemiparesis, chronic kidney disease, anemia, deep vein thrombosis s/p IVC filter. At baseline, the patient was verbal, oriented to person and place. She was non-ambulatory. Medication: aspirin, simvastatin, metoprolol, clonidine. Physical examination: frail, elderly patient in no acute distress. Neurological examination: Awake non-verbal, not following commands but responsive to noxious stimuli. Left pupil was non-reactive to light. Motor exam revealed an old left hemiparesis and new onset right sided weakness. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable. Hospital Course: On arrival in the emergency department she had a seizure which was treated with lorazepam and phenytoin. Laboratory results demonstrated normal coagulation and liver function tests. Her CBC and chemistry results were consistent with her previous diagnosis of mild anemia and chronic kidney disease. CT head was initially read as multiple punctate hemorrhagic strokes in the left temporal lobe and a left subdural hematoma. On further review of the imaging, the question of a venous thrombosis was raised. A magnetic resonance venogram subsequently revealed a thrombosis involving the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as the internal jugular vein on the left side. After discussing the poor prognosis with the family, the patient was transferred to the palliative service where she expired two days later. Discussion: Cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis is a cause of stroke most commonly seen in young patients with underlying precipitants including coagulapathies, infection, trauma, vascular malformations and pregnancy. Cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis is considered uncommon in older adults and there are no studies regarding the natural history, prognosis and treatment in geriatric patients. This case highlights an unusual etiology of a stroke in an older adult. However, with the availability of MRI the diagnosis is being made more frequently.

N2  - Introduction: Latent tuberculosis (TB) is a condition in which a person is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis but does not have active tubercular disease. Isoniazid (INH) is the mainstay of treatment for latent TB. Unfortunately INH is associated with serious adverse reactions including hepatotoxicity. Older patients are at increased risk for developing INH induced hepatotoxicity. Currently no guidelines exist which address the use of this toxic medication in frail, older patients with limited life expectancy. This case illustrates INH induced hepatotoxity in an elderly patient with advanced dementia. Case Report: A 68 year old Caucasian nun with advanced dementia and a positive PPD but negative chest x-ray was admitted to the hospital with severe jaundice. The health department had mandated she be treated with INH therapy for latent TB, 8 weeks prior to her presentation. Evaluation found a severely demented obese female with a bright orange hue in her skin, sclera icterus, dry mucous membranes, lethargy, and confusion. Bilirubin was 11.5 and continued to increase peaking at 17.9; transaminases were also elevated (AST 1061, ALT 1604). Other etiologies of liver failure were ruled out and a diagnosis of INH induced hepatotoxicity and associated renal failure with severe dehydration was made. Renal and hepatic consults were called given concern she may require dialysis and other aggressive supportive measures. Her health care surrogate reported she was a do not resuscitate patient and that her family would not want hemodialysis. With withdrawal of the INH and ongoing supportive therapy she gradually improved over the next few weeks and was able to be discharged with her transaminases returning to normal values. Discussion: This case highlights that frail elderly patients, especially those with dementia and other comorbidities, are more susceptible to INH induced hepatotoxicity. While current recommendations are to treat everyone with latent TB with aggressive INH therapy, the decision to treat latent TB should be made after risks of therapy are closely weighed with the benefits of said treatment. Life expectancy, fragility and dementia should be included in this decision to treat. This patient's risk factors for negative outcomes clearly outweighed potential benefit from INH therapy.

N2  - A frail 75-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, diabetic foot ulcers, hypertension, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, chronic renal insufficiency, and recent left foot methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis status post trans-metatarsal amputation developed delirium and was found to be markedly hypoglycemic at home. The patient's condition improved with oral glucose provided by emergency medical services and she was transferred to the hospital. History revealed that the patient had developed decreased appetite since her recent hospitalization for osteomyelitis that was exacerbated after administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. She became symptomatic following administration of glipizide 5mg, nateglinide 60mg, and metformin 1000mg. Of note, the patient was recently initiated on glipizide and discontinued from metformin. Physical exam revealed bilateral, 3+ pitting lower extremity edema, left lower extremity warmth without erythema, and a clean and dry wound dressing. Labs were not significant for infection or electrolyte abnormalities, and renal function was at baseline. Chest x-ray was unremarkable. Despite close monitoring and oral intake the patient developed a seizure in the setting of severe hypoglycemia. Previous finger sticks were low, but as the patient was asymptomatic there was no change in management. Subsequently, she required intravenous dextrose for nearly 24 hours. Further history and exam suggested multiple etiologies for both her anorexia and hypoglycemia. These included acute and chronic disease burden, inappropriate medication administration, and polypharmacy. In addition, the patient's most recent discharge summary contained a vital medication omission, oxycodone, and did not discuss the potential for antibiotic and/or narcotic induced anorexia and the threat of secondary hypoglycemia. This case illustrates not only the unpredictable consequences of polypharmacy in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, but also the sometimes adverse results of inadequate discharge documentation during transitions of care. It sheds light on the necessity that hospital summaries not only reflect current medication reconciliation but also clearly state the possible side effects of medications with attention to early recognition of adverse reactions and communication of a clear contingency plan in vulnerable elderly patients.

N2  - Frail elderly people are particularly vulnerable during hurricanes. Of the 1,330 people known to have perished along the Gulf Coast as a result of Hurricane Katrina, 71% of those in Louisiana were older than 60 years, 47% were older than 75 years, and at least 68 died in nursing homes. Unfortunately, community disaster planning frequently fails to allow for the needs of the frail elderly before, during, and after hurricanes. This paper discusses the particular vulnerabilities of the frail elderly, especially those with chronic diseases, those in residential care facilities, and those who are dialysis-dependent. The importance of the Incident Management System (IMS) is discussed, and those who care for the frail elderly in long-term care facilities must understand and use IMS in dealing with hurricane-related disasters. Recommendations are made that will improve hurricane disaster planning for the frail elderly. From a policy viewpoint, it is critical that the elderly, especially those with chronic diseases, be included in disaster planning at the federal, state, and local levels to ensure that a repeat of the Hurricane Katrina debacle does not occur. © 2011 Policy Studies Organization.

N2  - Patients with ESRD have extensive and unique end-of-life care considerations and needs. Despite substantial advancements in renal palliative care over the past decade, much research is still required. Identifying CKD patients whose illness trajectory has shifted and would likely benefit from a palliative approach to care should be a priority of all nephrology programs. Further research on symptom management, the effectiveness of ACP, the life expectancy of conservatively managed and incident dialysis patients, anticipated changes in functional status and HRQL with the initiation of dialysis (especially among the frail elderly), and the best way to deliver renal palliative care is required to maximize the integration and effectiveness of renal palliative care services.

N2  - Older patients on dialysis have unique needs and characteristics and their outcomes vary from that of their younger counterparts. Comparatively fewer will start or be maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to younger patients, despite the fact that hemodialysis is often poorly tolerated. Barriers to PD for older patients include poor vision, frailty, cognitive dysfunction, accommodation issues, and a bias from renal teams that older patients cannot do PD. The development of assisted PD can overcome many of these barriers. The ability of older patients to use PD as their dialysis modality should not be determined by whether they live in an area where the nephrologist is a PD enthusiast. All patients should be given nonbiased information so they can choose the dialysis modality that gives them the best quality of life and suits their and their family's lifestyle. © 2011 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis.

N2  - Background and objectives: Elderly patients (>65 years old) are a rapidly growing demographic in the ESRD and intensive care unit (ICU) populations, yet the effect of ESRD status on critical illness in elderly patients remains unknown. Reliable estimates of prognosis would help to inform care and management of this frail and vulnerable population. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: The effect of ESRD status on survival and readmission rates was examined in a retrospective cohort of 14,650 elderly patients (>65 years old) admitted to 11 ICUs in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada between 2000 and 2006. Logistic regression models were used to adjust odds of mortality and readmission to ICU for baseline case mix and illness severity. Results: Elderly ESRD patients had twofold higher crude in-hospital mortality (22% versus 13%, P < 0.0001) and readmission rate (6.4 versus 2.7%, P = 0.001). After adjustment for illness severity alone or illness severity and case mix, the odds ratio for mortality decreased to 0.85 (95% CI: 0.57 to 1.25) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.55 to 1.23), respectively. In contrast, ESRD status remained significantly associated with readmission to ICU after adjustment for other risk factors (OR 2.06 [95% CI: 1.32, 3.22]). Conclusions: Illness severity on admission, rather than ESRD status per se, appears to be the main driver of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients. However, ESRD status is an independent risk factor for early and late readmission, suggesting that this population might benefit from alternative strategies for ICU discharge.

N2  - Background. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is directly associated with survival. However, the prognostic significance of GFR might be different according to the formula used to estimate it. We aimed at comparing the association between GFR estimated using three different formulas and 1-year survival in elderly patients discharged from acute care hospitals.Methods. Our series consisted of 439 patients aged 65 and older admitted to 11 acute care medical wards enrolled in a multicentre prospective observational study. GFR was estimated by body surface area-adjusted CockcroftGault (CG-BSA), Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulas. The relative risk of mortality in patients with estimated GFR = 3059.9 or < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared to people with estimated GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was calculated using Cox regression analysis.Results. Participants with reduced GFR showed an increased mortality, regardless of the equation used, and the highest one was associated with CG-BSA-estimated GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. After adjusting for potential confounders, CKD-EPI-estimated GFR remained significantly associated with the outcome [3059.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.70, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.022.98; < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, HR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.205.66], while the strength of the association was clearly reduced for MDRD (3059.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.832.38; < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, HR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.014.30) and CG-BSA (3059.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, HR = 1.79, 95% CI = 0.674.53; < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, HR = 2.68, 95% CI = 0.927.55).Conclusion. GFR adds to the list of prognostic indicators in elderly and frail people, and CKD-EPI-derived GFR, which outperforms to some extent MDRD and CG-BSA-derived GFR in a multivariable predictive model, seems worthy of testing in wider populations. © 2010 The Author.

N2  - Management of chronic uremia in elderly patients presents several clinic and organizational difficulties. Hemodialysis (HD) and chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) are both available for the elderly, and the choice depends on the individual, clinical and familial conditions. Several reports have compared the outcomes for older patients treated by HD or peritoneal dialysis, with those for younger or older patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. CPD is a successful dialysis option for elderly patients, in both patient and technique survival terms. All nutritional parameters are of pivotal importance. Several barriers, such as medical and social factors, physician bias, late referral and education irrespective of the needs of older patients, influence the choice of CPD. The development of assisted peritoneal dialysis, using community-based nurses or health care assistants, can overcome some of the barriers and enable frail older patients to have home-based dialysis treatment. Increasing age is associated with higher peritonitis rates among patients who started CPD in the 1990s, while age is not associated with peritonitis in more recent CPD cohorts, and no greater frequency of adverse outcomes of peritonitis has been seen among those who began CPD after the year 2000. In elderly dialysis patients, the management of quality of life (QOL) is important as well as adequacy of dialysis, nutritional status and survival rate. To obtain a good standard of QOL, it is essential to select carers who are properly educated and who can access an adequate support system, both physical and psychological, to help them cope with their burden. © 2010 Società Italiana di Nefrologia.

N2  - Introduction:: Frailty, characterized by decrease in overall function and physiologic reserve, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the general population. We investigated the burden of frailty across the spectrum of ankle brachial index (ABI). Methods: We used data from National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999-2002 to determine association of frailty with ABI in respondents aged >50 years. Criteria used to classify participants by frailty status included: ≥5% unintentional weight loss in prior year or low body mass index (<18.5 kg/m2); slow walking speed (lowest sex-adjusted quintile); weakness in carrying a 10-pound load; self-reported exhaustion and low physical activity. Participants fulfilling 1 or 2 criteria were classified as pre-frail, and those meeting ≥3 criteria were classified as frail. We evaluated whether ABI categories (<0.9, 0.9 ≤ABI <1.1, 1.1 ≤ABI <1.4 and ≥1.4) were independent predictors of frail and pre-frail state in multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses that adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, smoking, history of non skin cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, arthritis, cardiovascular disease (history of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure or stroke), lean body mass, and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Results: Among 3571 respondents, prevalence of frailty in respondents with ABI <0.9 (17.5%) and 0.9 ≤ABI <1.1 (6.7%) was higher than in subjects with normal ABI-1.1≤ ABK1.4 (4.7%). In multivariable regression analysis, the presence of PAD (ABI <0.9) was associated with increased odds of frailty (OR 2.31, 95% CI, 1.08-4.94) and pre-frailty (OR 1.36, 95% CI, 0.90-2.07). This association persisted after additional adjustment for plasma CRP and lean body mass. We also observed a higher prevalence of frailty in participants with ABI ≥1.4 (7.3%), although this association was not statistically significant (P=0.39). Conclusion: In a nationally representative sample of adults we observed a higher burden of frailty and pre-frailty in respondents with PAD independent of potential confounders. Frailty may be one of the pathways that mediate increased morbidity and mortality seen in patients with PAD.

N2  - Although most investigators still define as 'elderly those older than 65 years of age, recently, many would consider elderly to be those 75-80 years or older, mainly because those 65-75 years of age are still active, continue working and are relatively healthy. The care of the elderly who require chronic dialysis is more complex than the management of their younger counterparts owing to their frequent comorbid conditions, numerous impairments, functional limitations and lack of social support. The ideal timing of dialysis initiation in the elderly with slowly progressing chronic kidney disease has not been clearly defined because we have not defined predictors that may negatively affect their outcomes. Recent developments in the management of hypertension and other complications, and the addition of an appropriate diet, may delay progression to dialysis. In the absence of severe comorbidity, the choice of dialysis rather than conservative nondialysis therapy is associated with longer survival in elderly patients but not in those with multiple comorbidities. Quality of life and survival rates seem to be similar in elderly patients on either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, although selection bias may confound these findings. Assisted peritoneal dialysis is a suitable method for frail elderly patients who choose to be dialyzed at home. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  - Results: The first clinical guideline to recognize the unique needs of older adults with diabetes was released in 2003 and encourages providers to consider the quality of life (QOL) of older adults with diabetes when making recommendations, and to screen for and manage geriatric syndromes. However, the extent to which geriatric syndromes affect QOL relative to traditional complications is poorly understood. Eligibility included adults ≥60 years, enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California's Diabetes Registry, who completed the full version of the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) survey. This cross-sectional survey included the SF-8TM, which measures QOL with physical (PCS) and mental component scores (MCS). We constructed multiple linear regression models including either all geriatric syndromes (chronic pain, frailty, depression, falls, and urinary incontinence in women) or all traditional complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, amputation, foot ulcer, neuropathy, end-stage renal disease, retinopathy and severe hypoglycemia) as predictors of QOL. Models were adjusted for demographics, health behaviors, and diabetes factors. We report R2 and adjusted R2 (Ra2) to describe the variability in QOL explained by either all syndromes (Syn) or complications (Cx). Subjects had a mean age of 67 (N=6317) and the SF-8 scores were 51.2 (PCS) and 45.0 (MCS). The R2s of PCS syndrome models were 0.41 for women (W) and 0.43 for men (M); for MCS syndrome models, the R2s were 0.44 (W) and 0.38 (M). For complication models, the R2s were 0.27 (PCS) and 0.10 (MCS). The R a 2s for models including all complications were lower than for models including all syndromes (PCS: 0.26 (Cx) vs. 0.40 (W Syn) and 0.42 (M Syn); MCS: 0.09 (Cx) vs. 0.43 (W Syn) and 0.37 (M Syn)). Geriatric syndromes are more predictive of QOL than traditional complications in older adults. Geriatric syndromes predicted physical and mental QOL to a similar degree; traditional complications predicted physical QOL more than mental QOL. This study provides support for guideline recommendations to screen for and manage geriatric syndromes in older adults with diabetes.

N2  - Critical limb ischemia (CLI) represents one of the most challenging and cost-consuming cardiovascular healthcare problems in the world. It refers to limb-threatening peripheral atherosclerotic ischemia and is typically characterized by multilevel, multivessel infrainguinal and tibial arterial occlusive disease, primarily afflicting patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease (1, 2, 3). It is estimated that almost 1% of all people older than 50 years of age present with symptoms of CLI, accounting for 1.5 million patients in Europe and approximately 2 million patients in the United States (1, 3). Diabetes mellitus is well known to multiply the risk of CLI by a factor of four, and diabetic patients with CLI are as much as 10 times more vulnerable to amputation than normoglycemic patients. Almost half of all amputees suffer from diabetes (1, 2, 3). Without prompt revascularization, CLI entails a high risk of major amputation. Wolfe et al. classically described the poor prognosis of CLI in more than 6000 patients (4). If left untreated, CLI caused major amputation in 73% of patients with rest pain and in 95% of patients with tissue loss at 1 year. On the contrary, revascularization achieved a 75% 1-year limb salvage rate. Overall survival was poor, and cumulative probabilities were around 50% after 3 years (4). In the interest of prevention of limb loss, patients with CLI are candidates for revascularization attempts by surgical or percutaneous methods. Although infrainguinal bypass surgery remains the cornerstone of CLI treatment, the majority of the patients are ineligible because of diffuse infrapopliteal arterial occlusions, absence of suitable vein grafts, and multiple underlying comorbidities (6, 8, 9). Compared to surgery, angioplasty is a minimally invasive procedure with a clear benefit of reduced complications and periprocedural adverse events, especially in the frail patient cohort of elderly octogenarians (5, 8). In addition, it may be repeated as necessary, and more than 1 vessel to the foot may be recanalized. Technologic advancements and additions to the “endovascular toolbox” have increased their versatility and applicability in the highly morbid and fragile population of patients with CLI, with consistently favorable clinical results. The primary goal of infrapopliteal angioplasty is to restore at least 1 straight line of blood flow to the distal foot. The secondary objective is to preserve the patency of the treated lesion for as long as possible to avoid recurrence of CLI symptoms. In the majority of the cases, infrapopliteal angioplasty may be combined with more proximal femoropopliteal endovascular procedures (6, 10, 11). Occasionally, it may be applied in tight distal anastomotic lesions of bypass grafts to avoid early graft failure and thrombosis. It is now clear that patency outcomes after superficial femoral artery (SFA) procedures are negatively affected by compromised and poor tibial runoff (12). Reported complication rates range from 3 to 11% and include puncture site hematomas, vessel perforation, dissection, and distal embolism or thrombosis, which may be successfully managed endovascularly. The reported 30-day mortality rate of infrapopliteal angioplasty is <1.7% (8). Scientific evidence regarding safety and overall clinical effectiveness of infrapopliteal angioplasty supports its application as a firstline treatment option for infrapopliteal obstructive arterial disease in the setting of CLI (7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14). The FIRE (Foundation for Interventional Radiology in Europe) registry organized by the Cardiovascular Interventional Radiology Society of Europe enrolled 396 patients with 409 critically ischemic limbs. An 83% cumulative limb salvage rate and a 91% cumulative survival rate were achieved after a mean follow-up period of almost 6 months (15). Univariate analysis within the FIRE registry showed that cardiac disease, carotid disease, and renal insufficiency were unfavorably associated with both mortality and limb salvage (15). A random effects meta-regression analysis of 18 studies published between 1984 and 1997 and including 1280 patients treated with infrapopliteal balloon angioplasty reported overall limb salvage rates of 79% at 1 year and 74% after 2 years (16). A more recent metaanalysis of 30 studies published between 1990 and 2006 reported 3-year limb salvage and patient survival probabilities of 82.4 and 68.4%, respectively (17). For comparison, the 5-year limb salvage rates using autogenous veins for infrapopliteal bypass range from 73 to 81% (18, 19, 20, 21, 22). Theoretically, endovascular alternatives may also relate to reduced healthcare costs as a result of the decreasing number of amputations being performed. The patients' quality of life may also be dramatically improved if we prevent or even lessen the extent of amputation. A systematic review of the literature analyzing outcomes of stenting below-the-knee in 18 non-randomized studies, including 640 patients in total, has shown that sirolimus-eluting stents appear to be superior to bare metal and paclitaxel-eluting stents with regard to both angiographic and clinical outcomes (23). Eighteen nonrandomized studies were analyzed comprising 640 patients in total. After a median follow-up of 12 months, primary patency was 79% (95%CI, 72-86%), improvement in Rutherford class was noted in 91% (95%CI, 86-97%), target vessel revascularization was necessary in 10% (95%CI, 6-14%), and limb salvage was achieved in 96% (95%CI, 95-98%) of the cases. Head-to-head comparisons showed that sirolimus- eluting stents were superior to balloon-expandable bare metal stents in preventing restenosis and increasing primary patency (both p<0.001) (23). In line with the above results, recently released results from the PARADISE study (a nonrandomized single-center study in the United States investigating leg amputations in critical limb ischemia with below-the-knee angioplasty and drug-eluting stents) showed that the 3-year cumulative incidence of amputation was 6±2%, survival was 71±5%, and amputation-free-survival was 68±5% (24). To conclude, minimally invasive infrapopliteal angioplasty procedures are becoming the new gold standard of below-the-knee arterial disease, especially in patients suffering from CLI. Patient survival and limb salvage rates are very promising, exceeding those of historical controls.

N2  - Introduction.- At present there is insufficient data to determine whether the high mortality recorded following heart failure (HF) hospitalisation is a result of the intrinsic characteristics of the geriatric patient or a consequence of cardiac failure. Methods.- We compared baseline characteristics and prognosis of individuals over the age of 75 discharged from an acute geriatric unit (AGU) between January 1st 2007 and January 1st 2009 with or without a diagnosis of HF. Cardiac failure subjects received care in accordance with European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines and all patients underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment and targeted intervention. Results.- A total of 712 patients were included, 344 HF (GroupHF) and 368 without HF (NoHF). Mean age was 85.4 GroupHF and 87.7 NoHF (P = 0.361), 67% were females. Length of stay was 10.3 and 11.7 days (P = 0.57); 12 and 24 month mortality was 32% vs. 34% and 49.1% vs. 50.8% and Charlson comorbidity index was 4.12 and 2.42 (P < 0.001). There was a higher prevalence of chronic diseases in the HF group (P < 0.001): COPD (36.3 vs. 21.7%), Chronic renal disease (34.6 vs. 15.8%), anaemia (35.2. vs. 16%), and hypertension (74.1 vs. 55.7%) but dementia was more common in NoHF (39.1 vs. 19.5%. Moderate functional and cognitive impairment were recorded in 39.2% and 15.8% GroupHF and in 51.8% and 38.9% NoHF (P < 0.001). Leucocytosis and elevated red cell distribution width were more frequent in the GroupHF compared to NoHF (P < 0.001). Conclusions.- HF patients admitted to our AGU are more independent and less cognitively impaired than those without HF, with no statistically significant differences in length of stay, 12 or 24-month mortality. The high fatality recorded in our cohort may be inherent to the nature of our very elderly, frail, multimorbid, dependent subjects rather than determined by underlying specific illnesses such as cardiac failure.

N2  - Introduction.- Elderly patients on dialysis are especially vulnerable for developing disabilities and functional decline, not only because of their age, but also because of high co-morbidity and the impact of dialysis on daily functioning. Care as usual in older dialysis patients is often not equipped to identify domains that need extra attention. Goal of this pilot study was to perform a systematic Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment to study physical and psychosocial functioning of older dialysis patients. Method.- Patients and primary caregivers were interviewed according to the Develop strategies Enabling Frail Elders New Complications to Evade (DEFENCE) care model, a CGA which was earlier developed and validated in the DEFENCE study. This assessment includes different tests and questionnaires concerning risk of functional decline (Identification of Seniors At Risk [ISAR]), activities in daily life (Katz ADL-15), nutritional status (Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire [SNAQ]), global cognitive status (, Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE]; Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in Elderly [IQCODE]), change of behaviour (Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire [NPI-q]), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale [GDS]), quality of life (EuroQol-6D) and caregiver burden. Results.- Fifty patients and their primary caregivers were interviewed (24% female, 68%, >75 yrs old, 76.6% on haemodialysis). According to the ISAR, 74% of patients showed a high risk on functional decline. Professional care was needed by 89% (mostly for household chores) and over 55% of patients received informal care from family or others. Furthermore, 22% were severely malnourished and 24% had depressive symptoms. Cognitive decline was present in 6.7%. Change of behaviour was often observed by caregivers: changes in eating (34%), irritability (28%), apathy (26%) and depression (26%). Conclusions.- Older patients on chronic dialysis have a high risk of functional decline. A systematic CGA reveals many conditions that could be associated with this decline.

N2  - Dialysis-associated steal syndrome with rest pain and ischemic nonhealing ulcers dictates prompt surgical intervention. Distal revascularization with interval ligation is extensive surgery for frail patients in whom calcified distal arteries make anastomosis difficult. Simple banding is appropriate in high-flow fistulas. In low-flow accesses, further flow reduction by simple banding may result in inadequate dialysis and cause thrombosis. However, banding between puncture sites maintains a pressure gradient between the arterial and venous puncture sites that enables adequate flow with effective hemodialysis that would not be possible with banding at the anastomosis. This new technique is a good solution for maintaining access patency and increasing digital pressure while avoiding complicated surgical revisions in high-risk patients. © 2010 Society for Vascular Surgery.

N2  - Introduction: The progression of chronic kidney diseases are strongly associated with the frailty syndrome. However, there is lack of data concerning the impact of renal transplantation on parameters associated with the frailty syndrome such as weight loss, exhaustion, low grip strength and low gait speed as well as diminished physical activity. Methods: In a prospective cohort analysis among persons following renal transplantation we used comprehensive geriatric assessment to estimate the prevalence of frailty associated deficits in various functional domains. Activities of daily living (ADL), clock completion test (CCT), grip strength using vigorimetry, timed-up-and-go-test (TUG), geriatric depression scale (GDS-15) and mini nutritional assessment (MNA) were performed in renal transplanted patients older than 65 years. Data obtained were grouped according to the frailty criteria by Linda Fried to obtain frailty staging. Results: 31 women and 54 men were recruited (mean age: 70.2 ± 4.4 years for females and 70.4 ± 4.4 years for males). Mean duration from transplantation was 8.8 ± 6.5 years for both genders. The overall prevalence of frailty was 13 %, 29 % were considered to be pre-frail. Mean ADL-score was 96.47 ± 7.97, mean CCT-score was 7.48 ± 1.79. The average time needed for the TUG came to 11.14 ± 6.36 seconds. Grip strength on average amounted to 73 ± 18.6 kPa for women and 87.7 ± 23.5 kPa for men. Frailty was associated with a higher amount of prescribed drugs (p = .001) as well as with an increased number of diseases (p = .009) and showed significant correlation to all of the assessment parameters (p < .001). Personal well-being as indicated by GDS-15 showed a wide range of variance (mean score 2.80, range 0 to 12) and seemed to be attributed to somatic and health associated functionality. Conclusion: In regard of the increased rate of hospitalization and mortality in elderly renal transplant recipients comprehensive geriatric assessments are validated tools to identify frailty and to set targets for prevention of functional decline in these patients.

N2  - Introduction: The elderly are often considered to be ineligible for PD. Assisted automated peritoneal dialysis (aAPD) is being developed in the UK to broaden access to PD. It is primarily intended for the frail and elderly but can also be used for younger patients unable to perform self-care PD but who wish to dialyse at home. Aim: Retrospective study of the aAPD program at a single center implemented from 2007 following a successful pilot project in 2005. Method: A third-party health-care agency is used to provide community health-care assistants (HCA) trained and supervised by Baxter Healthcare (UK). The assistance is once a day for a 30-45 minute visit. The HCA dismantles the overnight APD equipment and re-assembles the cycler for use at night. Additional assistance for some patients includes weight, blood pressure measurement and PD exit site dressing. Patient selection: Ability to safely connect/disconnect from cycler is essential. All have ≥2 comorbidity scores and barriers to self-care PD. Results: 12 (9 female, 3 male) patients registered. Mean age starting aAPD 67.5 (32-82) years. Origin of care: 2 hemodialysis, 4 self-care PD, 6 predialysis. 3 patients had shared aAPD (family/personal carer). Outcomes: Length of time on assistance: 29 days-24 months to date. Reason for stopping: 1 ultrafiltration failure and transferred to hemodialysis, 3 deaths, 3 transferred to independent self-care PD. Only 1 patient (on shared aAPD) has had peritonitis; this was due to pseudomonas and was concurrent with PD exit-site infection. Conclusion: aAPD using HCAs is an affordable dialysis modality within the UK NHS (National Health Service). Such assistance enables patients to stay on PD when unable to continue independently and provides a homebased treatment for patients too frail to carry out PD entirely themselves. Of note, some do become independent after time on aAPD.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: With the Dutch population aging, the number of individuals 75 years old or more in need of dialysis is growing. Dialysis can significantly prolong survival in these patients. However, hemodialysis can be perceived as too burdensome as these patients are likely to spend some 50% of their remaining life at or in hospital. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an ideal alternative as it is less aggressive; avoids time at or travelling to hospital and limits exposure to hospital pathogens. When informal help is not available, Dutch patients can be institutionalized in a nursing home where PD is performed safely. Providing nursing services at home (assisted PD) can be an alternative. The aim of this analysis was to verify the cost-effectiveness of assisted PD. Methods: A decision-tree model was constructed in Excel to estimate the cost-effectiveness of assisted automated PD (aAPD). Current treatment pathway (conservative management, CM: 40%; APD in nursing home, nhAPD: 60%) was compared to a new approach including aAPD at home (i.e., CM: 20%, nhAPD: 20%, aAPD: 60%). Data inputs included survival, quality adjusted life year (QALY) and costs. Survival data came from a weighted average of 3 published studies in this type of patients. Official tariffs (2009) were used for costs, except for conservative management where an assumption of 15 000 per year was made. Main data inputs for the base case are shown below: (Table presented) Scenario analyses on the 1-year analysis were performed by varying survival rates, costs (±10%), QALY (±5%) and percent of CM patients (0-40%). Sensitivity analyses on the 5-year analysis were performed by using survival data from the published studies that showed the largest and smallest difference in survival. The healthcare payers perspective was taken. Results: Both 1-year and 5-year analyses showed that aAPD is dominant, i.e., more effective and less costly than the current treatment pathway. All scenarios analyzed gave similar results with incremental cost-efficacy ratios ranging from (-19 705 to -1 698 479/QALY). Over a 5-year period, offering aAPD in addition to CM and nhAPD can generate savings of around 17 500 (13 500-23 055) per patient to the healthcare payers. Conclusions: Dialysis in frail patients can improve their survival and quality of life significantly. However, these patients are likely to need help to perform the procedure at home. In the absence of a spouse, child or carer, paid help may be necessary. Despite the investment required in home nursing activities, providing aAPD in frail elderly ESRD patients is a cost-saving alternative for Dutch healthcare payers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Over half of the adults diagnosed with diabetes in the U.S. are≥60 years. The unique needs of older patients with diabetes were formally recognized in 2003 with the publication of the first clinical guidelines for this population by the California Healthcare Foundation and American Geriatrics Society. These guidelines encourage providers to consider the quality of life (QOL) of older patients with diabetes when making treatment recommendations, and to screen for and manage geriatric syndromes. However, the extent to which geriatric syndromes, relative to traditional complications of diabetes, affect QOL is poorly understood. Understanding factors important to QOL of older adults with diabetes may guide prioritization of medical treatment for these complex patients. METHODS: Eligibility included adults≥60 years, enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California's Diabetes Registry, who completed the full version of the Diabetes Study of Northern California (DISTANCE) survey. This survey included a validated QOL assessment, the SF-8™. Physical (PCS) and mental component scores (MCS) (both ranges: 0-100 and means: 50) were used to assess QOL. To estimate the separate effects of prevalent geriatric syndromes [chronic pain, frailty, depression, falls, and urinary incontinence in women (UI)] and traditional complications of diabetes [myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure (HF), amputation, foot ulcer, neuropathy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), of mental health conditions and current medications. Patient-level ANCOVAs were conducted to determine ethnic/racial differences in 1) self-reported depressive symptomatology, 2) self-reported utilization of mental health services, 3) documention of depression or anxiety, and 4) documentation of psychiatric medication in patients' medical records. We adjusted for patient demographic characteristics including age, gender, education, and marital status. RESULTS: The sample was 59.7% female with a mean age of 58.8 years (sd=11.6). Most Vietnamese (86.0%) and Hispanic (74.8%) patients spoke limited or no English. As noted in Table 1, Vietnamese patients reported significantly higher rates of clinical depression compared to Hispanics and whites. Among patients with depressive symptoms, whites were significantly more likely to be diagnosed and treated compared to Vietnamese and Hispanics patients. Furthermore, Hispanic patients were less likely to report having seen a mental health provider in the past 12 months compared to Vietnamese and white patients. retinopathy and severe hypoglycemia] on PCS and MCS, we constructed weighted multiple linear regressions models for each syndrome/ complication. Each model was adjusted for age, gender, race, marital status, education, income, smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, diabetes medications and duration, and self-monitoring of glucose (e.g. PCS=chronic pain+covariates). To describe the relative strength of association of each of these syndromes/complications, we present the beta coefficients (β) from these models. The change in β indicates the change in PCS or MCS when a geriatric syndrome or traditional complication of disease was present (i.e. chronic pain) or occurs with more frequency (severe hypoglycemia) or worsening severity (e.g. UI). RESULTS: Ninety-five percent (n=6,317) of eligible survey respondents, average age 67, completed the SF-8 (PCS and MCSmeans: 51.2 and 45.0). Dementia was too rare (n=5) to be included. In adjusted models, each geriatric syndromes was associatedwith lower PCSandMCS: chronic pain(β: -10.0 -2.2), frailty (β: -9.4; -6.2), depression (β: -4.0; -6.5), falls (β: -3.5; -1.6), andUI (β: -1.4; -1.1), as were most traditional complications:MI (β: -2.3; -0.7), stroke (β: -2.2; -1.7),HF (β: -4.1; -1.7), amputation (β: -3.3; -1.6), foot ulcer (β: -2.9; -1.8), neuropathy (β: -1.5; -0.6), ESRD (β: -5.2; -2.3), and severe hypoglycemia (β: -2.4; -1.8). Retinopathy, defined by photocoagulation, proliferative retinopathy, or blindness, was not associated with lower PCS or MCS. All p-values for all reported results were <0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Considering all syndromes and complications, the geriatric syndromes, chronic pain, frailty, and depression, were the most predictive conditions of worse quality of life. ESRD and HF were the most predictive traditional complications. While the cross-sectional design precludes causal inferences, this study supports the importance of identifying and prioritizing treatment for geriatric syndromes in the context of diabetes care.

N2  - Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults, affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased importance. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Frailty is a term that describes a biologic syndrome seen in the elderly population. It is characterized by decreased reserve and resistance to stressors resulting from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems. The five domains of frailty are shrinkage, weakness, exhaustion, slow walking speed and low physical activity. Fifty-one per cent of ESRD patients are over the age of 65. Currently, only 7% of patients over 65 years old are listed on the kidney transplant waiting list. Our objective is to describe the level of frailty in our transplant cohort.We measured the five domains of frailty on kidney transplant patients aged 21-81 at the Johns Hopkins Transplant Center in Baltimore,MD. Measurements were taken prior to transplantation. Patients were classified as frail if they were frail by at least 3 out of the 5 domains, pre-frail by 1 or 2 domains, and non frail if they were not frail by any domains. Among 152 patients (mean age 53.16 ± 1.18) we found an overall 19% prevalence of frailty.The prevalence of prefrail patients was 59%, and pre-frail 22% were not frail. Our sample consisted of 32(21%) geriatric patients (65 and older) of which 10% were not-frail 68% were pre-frail and 23% were frail.Women had a 0.7 fold lower odds of frailty than men (p-value=0.049).We explored each component of frailty by age group. In our study population men were more frail than women.There was also a high prevalence of prefrailty among both our geriatric and non-geriatric patients. Though our transplant cohort consisted mainly of non-geriatric patients, both age groups presented with similar frailty profiles. Even though there is a high prevalence of ESRD patients who are older than 65, few of these patients have access to transplantation. This may be a result of selection bias.We acknowledge that the kidney transplant population in our study may not be representative of the ESRD population as a whole. However, more research needs to be conducted in order to characterize cause(s) of frailty, its mechanism in elderly patients with ESRD, and its relationship to outcomes in kidney transplant patients. We have presented preliminary data. Due to the nature of the data collection, more time is needed to gather sufficient data in order to make clinically sound, data-driven inferences.

N2  - It has been shown very recently, that the incidence of frailty and associated parameters such as weight loss, exhaustion, low grip strength and low gait speed as well as diminished physical activity may be correlated to progression of chronic kidney disease. However, there is lack of data concerning the impact of renal transplantation on parameters of the frailty syndrome. Methods: In a prospective cohort analysis among persons following renal transplantation we used comprehensive geriatric assessment to estimate the prevalence of frailty associated deficits in various functional domains. Activities of daily living (ADL), clock completion test (CCT), grip strength using vigorimetry, timed-upand- go-test (TUG), geriatric depression scale (GDS-15) and mini nutritional assessment (MNA) were performed in renal transplant patients older than 65 years. Data obtained were grouped according to the frailty criteria by Linda Fried to obtain frailty staging. Results: 31 women and 54 men were recruited (mean age: 70.2 ± 4.4 years for females and 70.4 ± 4.4 years for males). Mean duration from transplantation was 8.8 ± 6.5 years for both genders.The overall prevalence of frailty was 13 %, 29 % were considered to be pre-frail. Mean ADL-score was 96.47 ± 7.97, mean CCT-score was 7.48 ± 1.79. The average time needed for the TUG came to 11.14 ± 6.36 seconds. Grip strength on average amounted to 73 ± 18.6 kPa for women and 87.7 ± 23.5 kPa for men. Frailty was associated with a higher amount of prescribed drugs (p = .001) as well as with an increased number of diseases (p = .009) and showed significant correlation to all of the assessment parameters (p < .001). Personal well-being as indicated by GDS-15 showed a wide range of variance (mean score 2.80, range 0 to 12) and seemed to be attributed to somatic and health associated functionality. Conclusion: Despite renal transplantation two fifth of elderly multimorbid patients are still considered to be frail or pre-frail. Frailty status is strongly linked to functional decline. Other studies showed frailty prevalence in free-living elderly multimorbid people ranging from 7 to 19 %. In regard of the increased rate of hospitalization and mortality in this group of patients comprehensive geriatric assessment is a validated method to identify frailty and to set targets for prevention of functional decline in elderly renal transplant patients.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the acute and late outcomes of a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) program including both the transfemoral (TF) and transapical (TA) approaches; and 2) to determine the results of TAVI in patients deemed inoperable because of either porcelain aorta or frailty. Background: Very few data exist on the results of a comprehensive TAVI program including both TA and TF approaches for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with the Edwards valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, California) between January 2005 and June 2009 in 6 Canadian centers were included. Results: A total of 345 procedures (TF: 168, TA: 177) were performed in 339 patients. The predicted surgical mortality (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score) was 9.8 ± 6.4%. The procedural success rate was 93.3%, and 30-day mortality was 10.4% (TF: 9.5%, TA: 11.3%). After a median follow-up of 8 months (25th to 75th interquartile range: 3 to 14 months) the mortality rate was 22.1%. The predictors of cumulative late mortality were peri-procedural sepsis (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48 to 8.28) or need for hemodynamic support (HR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.11 to 6), pulmonary hypertension (PH) (HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.38 to 3.84), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.83). Patients with either porcelain aorta (18%) or frailty (25%) exhibited acute outcomes similar to the rest of the study population, and porcelain aorta patients tended to have a better survival rate at 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: A TAVI program including both TF and TA approaches was associated with comparable mortality as predicted by surgical risk calculators for the treatment of patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk, including porcelain aorta and frail patients. Baseline (PH, COPD, CKD) and peri-procedural (hemodynamic support, sepsis) factors but not the approach determined worse outcomes. © 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

N2  - Purpose of Review: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD. Recent Findings: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD. Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD. Summary: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL outcomes remains to be determined. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Nephrologists care for an increasing number of elderly patients on hemodialysis. As such, an understanding of the overlap among complications of hemodialysis and geriatric syndromes is crucial. This article reviews hemodialysis management issues including vascular access, hypertension, anemia and bone and mineral disorders with an attention towards the distinct medical needs of the elderly. Key concepts of geriatrics - frailty, dementia and palliative care - are also discussed, as nephrologists frequently participate in decision-making directed toward balancing longevity, functional status and the burden of therapy.

N2  - Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults, affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased importance.

N2  - Administrative data suggest familiar socioeconomic, race, sex, and age disparities in renal patients' receipt of services such as cardiac rehabilitation. Dialysis facility characteristics and disparities in access to transplantation, home-based dialysis, and more frequent dialysis also may influence patients' access to rehabilitation opportunities. Tested models exist for interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation, exercise/physical conditioning programs, and psychosocial interventions, and several of these programs consider the special needs of particular age groups. Recognition of the importance of physical activity/exercise and depressed mood as predictors of patient outcomes, and research addressing the concept of frailty, effectively may increase the salience of rehabilitation objectives throughout the renal community. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background. The incidence of chronic renal replacement therapy (RRT) varies markedly between Danish nephrology centres. The aim of the present study was to establish if there is regional and social variation in the incidence of chronic RRT in Denmark when analysed according to patient residence. The importance of diabetic nephropathy and patients aged 70 years or older was also studied.Methods. Incident patients on chronic RRT in the period 1995-2006 were identified in the Danish National Registry on Regular Dialysis and Transplantation. Information on residence, income, educational status and ethnic origin was obtained from Statistics Denmark. Rates of incident RRT patients were standardized for regional differences of sex and age as well as income, educational status and ethnic origin. Poisson regression was used when comparing rates.Results. Age- and sex-standardized incident chronic RRT rates among individuals with low income or short educational level were higher (P < 0.0001) compared to other groups. Also, standardized rates of patients in total and patients aged 70 years or older were higher in the catchment areas of the nephrology centres located in the two largest cities than for patients with residence in other areas of the country (P < 0.0001). Standardizing for regional differences of ethnic origin did not change the rates. The incident chronic RRT rate caused by diabetic nephropathy was higher for patients with residence in the catchment area of the nephrology centre in the largest city [49 per million people (p.m.p.) (95% CI = 40-57 p.m.p.)] compared to the catchment area of the nephrology centre located in the second largest city [31 (95% CI = 26-37 p.m.p.)] and other areas [29 p.m.p. (95% CI = 26-31 p.m.p.)] in 2001-06. When standardizing for differences in income among the 30-69-year-old persons, the rate of patients with residence in the catchment area of the nephrology centre located in the largest city decreased but was still higher than in other regions (P = 0.0003).Conclusions. There are marked socio-economic and regional differences in rates of incident RRT patients. The rates of incident RRT patients are highest in the catchment areas of the two largest nephrology centres and this may be partly explained by a higher frequency of end-stage diabetic nephropathy and a new treatment programme targeting frail, mainly elderly, patients. © The Author [2009].

N2  - As a result of the changing dialysis demographics, nephrologists are increasingly faced with problems traditionally considered to be geriatric issues. The specialty of nephrology has often been seen as using intensive, expensive, and complex technologies for patient care. Dialysis programs have evolved into highly efficient, fast-paced units that accommodate a rapid turnover of patients. They are in direct contrast to geriatric programs, which use geriatric principles to offer simple, multidimensional, holistic care to frail older patients. Finding the balance between nephrology and geriatric skill sets is a particular challenge for up-and-coming nephrologists who have an interest in geriatric nephrology. This mini-review addresses some of the challenges, increases awareness of specific issues, and highlights new opportunities in this field. Copyright © 2009 by the American Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Specific laboratory tests and physical findings are available to the practicing clinician that should raise the suspicion of inflammation. Inflammation is related to specific clinical outcomes. Once identified, changes in clinical practice may affect the level of inflammation in individual and or groups of dialysis patients with the hope that these changes may in turn affect outcome in a positive manner. Standard clinical tests and observations associated with inflammation are hypoalbuminemia, erythropoietin resistance, decreased iron saturation accompanied by high ferritin, frailty, low serum creatinine, reduced total and LDL-cholesterol, and increased C reactive protein (CRP). Inflammation is strongly associated with loss of physical function, dyslipidemia (low LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, increased triglycerides), and anemia that is unresponsive to erythropoietin. Inflammation is associated with cardiovascular events, increased hospitalization, and death. Correctible causes of inflammation are tunneled dialysis catheters, arteriovenous grafts, catheter infection, periodontal disease, poor water quality, and dialyzer incompatibility. Obesity also is a source of cytokines but may be less amenable to treatment. Inflammation is multifactorial in dialysis patients. Some sources are recognizable and correctable, such as vascular access type, clinical infection, and water quality, and some are not. Inflammation is strongly associated with outcome.

N2  - Lenalidomide (R) has significant activity in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). R has also shown activity in patients with AL amyloidosis, especially in combination with dexamethasone (D). However, AL patients are usually frail and R at the standard dose of 25 mg/day has been associated with significant toxicity. In MM patients, R with low dose D (Rd) has a better toxicity profile than the combination of R with high dose D. Alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide (C), are active in patients with AL and combinations of R with alkylating agents have given promising results in patients with MM. Thus, we designed a phase I/II trial of R, with low dose D and low dose C (RdC) in patients with AL. Primary objective of the study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for RdC and to assess hematologic response. Patients receive D 20 mg on days 1-4 (total 80 mg per cycle) , C on days 1-10, R on days 1-21 every 28 days, according to dose level (level 0: R 10 mg, C 50 mg, level 1: R 10 mg, C 100 mg, level 2: R 15 mg, C 100 mg). In the phase I part of the study, patients were observed for 2 cycles for determination of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) according to a standard 3+3 design. Patients with a creatinine ≤ 2.5 mg/dL and adequate hepatic function were enrolled. All patients receive low-dose aspirin or LMWH if indicated. So far 23 patients have been enrolled in the study (16 in phase I, 7 in phase II). In the phase I study, 3 patients were enrolled in dose level 0, 7 in dose level 1 and 6 in dose level 2. Dose level 2, (R 15 mg, C 100 mg) is being further explored; 7 patients have been enrolled in phase II and accrual is ongoing. So far, 132 cycles of therapy have been administered; 8 patients have receive > 6 cycles of RdC and 3 have completed 12 cycles of treatment. According to consensus criteria, heart was involved in 65%, kidneys in 61%, liver in 9% and 17% had AL-related peripheral neuropathy; 95% of the patients were Mayo stage II or III. Most patients (70%) were previously untreated. Among 7 pretreated patients, 2 had refractory disease, 2 had prior thalidomide and 5 had prior bortezomib. Hematologic response rates for patients who received at least 2 cycles of treatment, among all cohorts, was 64% and for the patients treated at dose level 2 was 75%. Median time to hematologic response was 2.5 months (range 0.9-4.8 months) for all patients and 1 month (range 0.9-2.9) for those treated at dose level 2. Organ responses have been recorded in 5 patients so far (3 cardiac and 3 renal responses, 1 patient had both cardiac and renal response). After a median follow-up of 7 months, 7 patients have died; 5 due to progressive heart amyloid, one patient had an acute MI followed by acute stent thrombosis and one died due to sepsis. The most common hematologic toxicities were anemia (grade 3/4 in 17%) and neutropenia (grade 3/4 in 17%). Most common non-hematologic toxicities were infection (grade > 3 in 22%), fatigue (grade > 3 in 9%), and rash (in 22%, grade 3 in 4%); also one patient suffered a stroke and one had DVT while on treatment with RdC. In parallel, and on a compassionate basis, AL patients with creatinine >2.5 mg/dL or on dialysis, were offered RdC with R dose adjusted according to CrCl. Initially R was given 15 mg every other day for CrCl <30 ml/min, or 15 mg thrice per week on the day after dialysis but due to toxicity R dose was reduced to 10 mg. So far, 13 patients have been treated with attenuated-dose RdC: 3 patients achieved a CR, one achieved a cardiac and one patient a liver response. However, the non-hematologic toxicity of the combination in patients with renal impairment was significant including fatigue (53%), infections (38%), rash (31%), diarrhea (15%), hyponatriemia (15%). Three patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity after the 1st cycle (including one early death due to non-neutropenic infection). In conclusion, RdC is an effective oral regimen for patients with AL amyloidosis, inducing significant rates of hematologic and organ responses. The recommended dose for RdC was R at dose of 15 mg, C at a dose of 100 mg and 20 mg of D and is further evaluated in the phase II of the study. Toxicity is manageable for patients with serum creatinine <2.5 mg/dL but can be significant for AL patients with more severe renal impairment. Lower doses of R, at 10 mg or less every other day or thrice per week should be used in these patients. Accrual in the phase II study is ongoing and updated results will be presented at the meeting.

N2  - The number of elderly patients requiring renal replacement therapy will continue to increase in the future. Previously, these patients were believed to have a poor prognosis on renal replacement therapy and therefore they were treated with conservative measures. Although there are no controlled randomized studies, an increasing amount of literature indicates that elderly persons with end-stage kidney disease are a heterogeneous population and that, in many of them, dialysis provides a good quality of life and survival. Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis have their own advantages and disadvantages and therefore it is important to individualize treatment to achieve the best result for each patient, taking into account the patient's wishes, local circumstances, availability of dialysis centers, and proper social support. Home treatments are the most suitable for frail elderly patients. In the latter population, peritoneal dialysis may be the method of choice because it can be performed by visiting nurses, thus allowing the patient to receive treatment at home without increasing the overall cost. © 2009.

N2  - Older adults (aged ≥65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging. Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death. Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to identify opportunities to intervene. © 2009 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

N2  - The aging of the US population, and Western society populations in general, has been of concern to demographers and health planners for a number of years. The implications of this demographic shift include both increased economic and health care burdens for the United States. The growth of the end-stage renal disease population in the 1980s and 1990s suggested massive increases in this very expensive and frail population. However, recent incidence rates suggest that future growth may not be as great as thought just a few years ago.

N2  - Background: The clinical characteristics of frail older patients with advanced heart failure have scarcely been studied. Objective: To describe this population and to identify some prognostic factors of mortality. Methods: 104 patients aged 75 years and older hospitalized with refractory heart failure were enrolled in a prospective multicentric study. Results: Mean age was 87.2 ± 5.3 years. Dyspnea (79.8%), crepitant rales (76.9%) and peripheral edema (73.1%) were particularly frequent. Signs of low cardiac output such as renal insufficiency (46.9%), cutaneous low flow (40.4%), and systolic hypotension (≤100 mm Hg) (24.3%) were observed less often. Signs of cognitive impairment including anxiety (55.4%), sleep disorders (43.7%) and delirium (35.5%) were frequent. Asthenia and chronic pain were noted in 92.3 and 37.5% of cases, respectively. Mortality rates were 32.7, 59.6 and 71.2% during hospitalization, at 6 months and at 12 months, respectively. According to the multivariate Cox model, six significant factors suggesting a poor prognosis were observed: chronic renal insufficiency, past neuropsychological pathology, long-term treatment with nitrates, presence of edema, low cutaneous flow, and pain. The ability to sit on a chair was the only significant factor associated with a good prognosis. Conclusion: Our study identified some clinical and prognostic factors which had been observed in very old patients with refractory heart failure. Pain management has to be a priority in these patients in order to improve their quality of life. Copyright © 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - The incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide, especially in the elderly. Recently, functional impairment and frailty have been recognized as factors affecting the quality of life, and outcomes in elderly patients with CKD and therapeutic interventions to improve function and reduce frailty are therefore being considered. Growth hormone (GH) levels decrease with age and GH actions are impaired in CKD patients. GH stimulates protein synthesis, bone, and glucose metabolism, and affects body composition by reducing body fat and increasing lean body mass. An increase in lean body mass may reduce frailty and thus avoid functional impairment. Thus, providing GH to elderly CKD patients could potentially improve outcomes and quality of life by lowering the risk of frailty and associated functional impairment. There are few studies assessing the long-term effects of GH administration on symptoms of frailty in elderly patients with CKD. In this review we will try to shed some light on the trials assessing the administration of GH to elderly subjects and to patients with CKD and focus on the possible role GH administration may play to improve frailty and quality of life in those patients. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Patients older than 75 years of age currently represent more than 35% of the population that begins dialysis each year in most European registries; in our centre, at least 30 patients in this age bracket begin dialysis, which represent 45% of the total incident patients. The absence of systematic studies makes this patient category almost indistinguishable from other categories, even though its peculiarity is now becoming evident. At least 30-40% of elderly individuals are expected to be frail and/or dependent, but the incidence of frailty is likely to be higher in those undergoing haemodialysis. Due to severe physical and/or mental impairment and often because of social hardship, these patients rarely experience clinical stability and are dependent on third parties for their survival. Early symptoms of frailty consist of weakness, anorexia, weight loss, muscular atrophy, reactive depression and cognitive deficits. Commonly, early signs and symptoms are underestimated until patients become dependent as defined by the presence of several pathological conditions, such as instability, immobility, iatrogenic drug reactions, intellectual impairment, and incontinence. The last phase of the condition is that of acute complications - pathological fractures, pressure ulcers, delirium, infectious complications with multiple hospital admissions, which cause a significant reduction in patient survival. The care of these patients presents complex problems for welfare services, and has led to the re-organisation of in-patient and out-patient dialysis units. Repeated patient admissions to the hospital require a much greater use of facilities and staff compared to younger dialysis patients. Of 112 elderly patients consecutively admitted to our dialysis programme over a period of 10 years, we identified 35 dependent (defined here as the need for continual assistance) patients (31.2%). Dependence proved to be the only clinical parameter associated with survival, while co-morbidity (in particular cardiovascular disease that usually affects survival rates in younger age groups) did not seem to be discriminating risk factors in the elderly. Emerging data from larger studies will likely demonstrate that the elderly should be systematically monitored for frailty and dependence during dialysis, as is the case in exclusively geriatric fields.Many of the clinical problems of the dialysed elderly, such as sensory, mental, and functional impairment, are more the result of advanced age, pre-existent diseases, and social deprivation, rather than of uraemia and dialysis per se. Prevention, as well as a therapeutic approach specifically modelled on these conditions, could help to improve the prognosis of this patient category, which is becoming numerically predominant in dialysis units. © W.S.

N2  - Background: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic kidney disease. Methods: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the association between frailty and chronic kidney disease. Results: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality. Conclusion: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection remain elusive. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The majority of countries have enacted edicts to regulate organ transplantation due to mounting recognition of its intricacies and increasing level of global disquiet. Frail national economy and status of health care infrastructure restricts access of the local population to both dialysis and transplantation in Pakistan. There is a surge in kidney transplantation activities, however. I have reported the enormity of organ crime in Pakistan. The number of commercial renal transplants range from 3000 to 4500. Foreign nationals share the marketplace. There are current attempts from the government to stop organ trade by strictly enforcing a recently sanctioned law on organ transplantation. Scarcity of comprehensive reliable data has hampered plausible assessments and indispensable modifications to facilitate designs for the future health care. Alternatives to organ transplantation will augment the choice of treatment modalities for a proliferating end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. The whole array of existing therapeutic modalities for ESRD has to be utilized. Promoting a fresh culture of organ donation by strengthening of the family institution may be another objective. © 2009, International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Objective: To update the evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and management of hypertension in adults for 2009. Options and Outcomes: For lifestyle and pharmacological interventions, evidence from randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews of trials was preferentially reviewed. Changes in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes of interest. However, for lifestyle interventions, blood pressure lowering was accepted as a primary outcome given the lack of long-term morbidity and mortality data in this field. Progression of kidney dysfunction was also accepted as a clinically relevant primary outcome among patients with chronic kidney disease. Evidence: A Cochrane collaboration librarian conducted an independent MEDLINE search from 2007 to August 2008 to update the 2008 recommendations. To identify additional published studies, reference lists were reviewed and experts were contacted. All relevant articles were reviewed and appraised independently by both content and methodological experts using prespecified levels of evidence. Recommendations: For lifestyle modifications to prevent and treat hypertension, restrict dietary sodium to less than 2300 mg (100 mmol)/ day (and 1500 mg to 2300 mg [65 mmol to 100 mmol]/day in hypertensive patients); perform 30 min to 60 min of aerobic exercise four to seven days per week; maintain a healthy body weight (body mass index 18.5 kg/ m2 to 24.9 kg/m2) and waist circumference (smaller than 102 cm for men and smaller than 88 cm for women); limit alcohol consumption to no more than 14 units per week in men or nine units per week in women; follow a diet that is reduced in saturated fat and cholesterol, and that emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fibre, whole grains and protein from plant sources; and consider stress management in selected individuals with hypertension. For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on by the patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to lower than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to lower than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered in all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in elderly patients who are frail). For adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic and/or systolic hypertension include angiotensin - converting enzyme ACE) inhibitors (in patients who are not black), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered as the initial treatment of hypertension if the systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above the target or if the diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above the target. The combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include long- acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement (recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease). Selected high-risk patients with hypertension who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy according to the position paper should nonetheless receive statin therapy. Once blood pressure is controlled, acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered. Validation: All recommendations were graded according to strength of the evidence and voted on by the 57 members of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force. All recommendations reported here achieved at least 95% consensus. These guidelines will continue to be updated annually. © 2009 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Aim: To determine the factors that may prolong the length of stay (LOS) for older patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and also to see if they are applicable to the younger patients. Methods: A retrospective case record review was conducted of all adult patients who were discharged from the general medical service or the geriatric medicine service of an acute care hospital over 6months. Results: During the study period, 393 patients were discharged with the diagnosis of pneumonia. Based on the study criteria, 200 patients were included in the study. Of the elderly patients, 39% had severe pneumonia compared to 9.3% in the younger group (P < 0.001), resulting in a higher mortality rate. All patients with severe pneumonia had serum albumin levels of less than 3.7g/dL. The median LOS was significantly shorter in the younger patients (4days) compared to the elderly patients (9days, P < 0.001). Severe pneumonia, dysphagia, chronic renal disease, hypoalbuminemia and older age group were found to be significantly associated with longer LOS. Conclusion: Compared to younger patients, older subjects aged 65 years and above hospitalized with CAP were more likely to have severe pneumonia and longer LOS. Presence of severe pneumonia, dysphagia, chronic renal disease, hypoalbuminaemia and age of more than 65years were significantly associated with longer LOS for all patients. However, in the younger group, only hypoalbuminaemia remained a significant factor. In the elderly patients, severe pneumonia, dysphagia and type of residence were important factors predicting longer LOS. © 2008 Japan Geriatrics Society.

N2  - Objective. The risk of invasive pneumococcal disease is increased among children with some chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to quantify the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in a wide range of chronic diseases. ATIENTS AND METHODS. Cases of invasive pneumococcal disease among children (aged 0-17 years) were identified from 1977 through 2005 by using a national surveillance program in Denmark. Rate ratios were assessed in a case-control study by using 10 age- and gender-matched controls per case. Chronic diseases were defined a priori. RESULTS. Among 1655 children with invasive pneumococcal disease, 19% had a history of chronic disease, according to our definition, versus 5% of controls. An increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease was observed for children followed >30 days after initial hospital contact for a chronic disease, but it was also increased in children with ≥5 hospital contacts for any other reason. Children with a history of cancer, chronic renal disease, splenectomy, and transplantation were particularly susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease. Adjusted for number of hospital contacts, the risk for children with other types of chronic disease was 1.4-fold more than for those with hospital contacts for any reason. CONCLUSIONS. Cancer, chronic renal diseases, splenectomy, and transplantation were strongly associated with an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in children. For children with other chronic diseases, their excess risk seemed to be attributable mostly to frail children having repeated hospital contact rather than their underlying condition.

N2  - Dedicated European and US clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes in the elderly have been released, but they do not specifically address the issue of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) in older patients with diabetes. General clinical guidelines have been published on the treatment of patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN), but these address the issue of how to prevent progression and treat advanced DN without distinguishing between different age groups. Elderly patients with diabetes and stages 3 to 4 CKD have particular needs that differ from those of younger patients with the same conditions. This is mainly due to their frailty and shorter life expectancy. Differently tailored therapeutic strategies are needed, which may have less stringent targets; and the use of common drugs should be critically evaluated. The management agenda (metabolic control, low-protein diet, controlling BP, preventing progression of advanced DN, preventing cardiovascular outcomes) for these patients is discussed in light of the limits and perspectives of current guidelines. Intensive, simultaneous management of all items on the agenda may not be feasible for a proportion of older patients, and clinicians may have to give priority to reducing some risk factors rather than others, choosing between different therapies.

N2  - Cinacalcet is a very efficient drug to suppress PTH and is well-tolerated, provided hypocalcemia is anticipated and prevented. This is particularly true for CKD patients Grades 3-4, for which a starting dose of 15 mg can be recommended. Besides its high cost, the question of tolerability justifies selecting the patients after the failure of basic treatment for uremia-induced hyperparathyroidism. This basic treatment is controversial. Based on cost-effectiveness and safety, we propose (sometimes in disagreement with NKF, KDOQI) the following measures in dialysis patients: vitamin D insufficiency detection and correction by native or 25-OH-vitamin D rather than by 1α-OH-vitamin D derivatives which blunt the hypophosphatemic effect of cinacalcet and its potency to suppress PTH: oral calcium phosphate binder without any limitation other than an increase of albumin-corrected SCa above 2.37 mmol/l (claimed to be associated with higher mortality in the USRDS data base). If necessary to prevent this mild hypercalcemia, use of noncalcic-phosphate binders or nicotinamide is recommended; in addition, dialysate calcium may be increased to 1.75 mmol/l, while predialysis albumin-corrected total calcium is increased up to 2.45 mmol/l in order to prevent perdialytic serum calcium increase (recently associated with aortic calcification extension). Cinacalcet has no marketing authorization for predialysis patients. Its use may be, however, medically justified in patients with severe hyperparathyroidism resistant to the rational basic treatment in order to prevent surgical parathyroidectomy and/or earlier dialysis treatment, especially in frail elderly patients. In hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism occurring after renal transplantation, cinacalcet at 30-60 mg is usually effective in decreasing elevated serum PTH and calcium levels. The issue whether this treatment is preferable to surgical subtotal parathyroidectomy is still being evaluated. © 2008 Dustri-Verlag Dr. Karl Feistle.

N2  - Background. In frail elderly patients, the chronic use of renal replacement therapy sometimes affords no tangible benefits and may even negatively affect their quality of life (Qol), making prolonged conservative management a reasonable option. Methods. This observational, uncontrolled study was conducted on 11 end-stage renal disease patients over 75 years of age, on prolonged conservative treatment with a follow-up of at least 6 months, to assess compliance with the Italian clinical guidelines concerning the treatment of renal failure, comorbidities, hospital stays, and several psychometric and Qol indicators in the patients and their caregivers. Results. We found a substantial compliance with the targets recommended in the guidelines, a moderate tendency for disease progression and satisfactory psychometric and Qol parameters, which proved much the same as those observed in a parallel (uncontrolled) group of patients on haemodialysis. Conclusions. Our study shows that a conservative strategy is feasible for frail uraemic patients, achieving acceptable clinical results and a Qol comparable with patients on haemodialysis. The study also provides indications on how to plan trials on this topic, to obtain the evidence needed to guide the difficult choice of whether to recommend dialysis or conservative treatment for such frail patients. © The Author [2007].

N2  - The proportion of older dialysis patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is considerably lower than that of younger patients. This is despite the fact that clinical outcome studies show that older patients cope at least as well as younger patients with PD, and that many older patients do not cope well with hemodialysis (HD). Barriers to PD include medical and social factors, physician bias, late referral, and education not tailored to the needs of older patients. The development of assisted PD can overcome some of the barriers and enable frail older patients to have home-based dialysis treatment. © 2008 International Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Hypertension in a nursing home patient is a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher and 130 mm Hg or higher in a patient with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher and 80 mm Hg or higher in a patient with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency. Numerous prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that antihypertensive drug therapy reduces the development of new coronary events, stroke, and congestive heart failure in older persons. The goal of treatment of hypertension in elderly persons is to lower the blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg and to less than 130/80 mm Hg in older persons with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency. Elderly persons with diastolic hypertension should have their diastolic blood pressure reduced to 80 to 85 mm Hg. Diuretics should be used as initial drugs in the treatment of older persons with hypertension and no associated medical conditions. The selection of antihypertensive drug therapy in persons with associated medical conditions depends on their associated medical conditions. If the blood pressure is more than 20/10 mm Hg above the goal blood pressure, drug therapy should be initiated with 2 antihypertensive drugs, one of which should be a thiazide-type diuretic. Other coronary risk factors must be treated in patients with hypertension. © 2008 American Medical Directors Association.

N2  - Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been advocated as a suitable substitution therapy in patients with failure of hemodialysis (HD) blood access, documentation of the performance of PD in such patients is limited. Here, we present an elderly patient with total failure of HD blood access who has had a remarkably successful course on PD. A 78-year-old man with several comorbidities started continuous ambulatory PD after a 3.5-year course of HD complicated by repeated vascular access infections and clotting episodes. These access complications resulted in 8 hospitalizations and led to inability to ambulate following a right femoral shaft fracture sustained in a fall secondary to confusion during an episode of access sepsis, and to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome following SVC thrombosis after internal jugular catheter insertion. Over approximately 3 years, PD has been very successful in this patient, with 2 early routine episodes of peritonitis and 1 early episode of exit-site infection, control of hematologic and biochemical values, no hospitalizations in the 2.5 years before the time of writing, and good quality of life. A dedicated spouse performing the PD tasks has been a major factor in the success of PD in this patient. Peritoneal dialysis can be successful as a renal replacement procedure in incapacitated elderly patients with failure of HD blood access. In these cases, the success of PD is enhanced by dedicated family members taking on PD tasks that the patient cannot perform.

N2  - Long-term care will increasingly shift from institutions to home and community based services. Using data from a Medicaid home care waiver program in South Carolina, the Community Long-Term Care (CLTC) program, we evaluated differences in frailty and service use among CLTC clients between 1995 (n = 3,748) and 2005 (n = 9,157). The expectation was that CLTC clients had become more frail in that period, and had greater access to services in the community, results that might suggest the CLTC program had helped individuals to avoid institutionalization. Frailty measures included acute and chronic conditions, other health conditions, and activities of daily living (ADL). We evaluated the percentage of clients using services, and service use intensity. A large majority of clients in both years were impaired in at least four ADL. In 2005, CLTC clients were significantly more likely to have chronic conditions, including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, diabetes, and renal failure (all p < 0.05). Clients were significantly more likely to receive specific services in 2005, including physical therapy, dialysis, and oxygen (all p < 0.05). Results suggest CLTC participants were more frail in 2005 than in 1995. This may reflect a successful effort to help individuals age in place in the community, delaying institutionalization. States may be able to control increases in Medicaid long-term care costs through home care programs that delay institutionalization. © by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Given the volume and cost of inpatient care during the last year of life, there is a critical need to identify patterns of dying as a means of planning end-of-life care services, especially for the growing number of older persons who receive services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Methods: A retrospective computerized record review was conducted of 20,933 VHA patients who died as inpatients between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002. Diagnoses were aggregated into one of five classification patterns of death and analyzed in terms of health care resource utilization (mean number of inpatient days and cumulative outpatient visits in the year preceding the patient's death). Results: Cancer deaths were the most common (30.4%) followed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (23.2%), cardiopulmonary failure (21.4%), frailty (11.6%), "other" diagnoses (7.3%), and sudden deaths (6.1%). Those with ESRD were more likely to be male and nonwhite (p < 0.05) and those with frailty were more likely to be older and married (p < 0.05). Controlling for demographic variables, those with frailty had the highest number of inpatient days while those with ESRD had the highest number of outpatient visits. Nonmarried status was associated with more inpatient days, especially among younger decedents. Conclusion: As a recognized leader in end-of-life care, the VHA can play a unique role in the development of specific interventions that address the diverse needs of persons with different dying trajectories identified through this research. © 2007 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many different populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its multitude of complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly higher risk for cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual. However, it is clear now that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of the complications but also prevent them. Therefore, various important public health organizations all over the world have turned their focus and attention to CKD and its risk factors, early detection and early intervention. Nevertheless, the general goals in preventing the increase in CKD and its complications are far from being completely achieved. Why is this so? What is the magnitude and complexity of the problem? How is it affecting the population - are there differences in its affection by age, gender or frail elderly versus the robust? Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and aggressively? Are there subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on dialysis versus the non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of CKD aggressively, will it make a difference in the disease progression, its complications or to quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly succumb to? What do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire dialysis or transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for those who refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly with CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist? The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality of life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other vital aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day practice by each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the elderly with men being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively the vital aspects of CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical standpoint. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  - Elderly patients are the largest and fastest growing group of patients with chronic kidney disease maintained on dialysis in the world. Because of advanced age and a heavy burden of comorbidities, the elderly are usually not candidates for kidney transplantation and are less likely to be offered peritoneal dialysis (PD). There is, however, growing evidence that the use of community nurses to assist with PD and the introduction of programs for assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) targeting these frail, elderly patients may enable more elderly patients to have their PD treatment at home. Suitable candidates for aPD are incident end-stage kidney disease patients preferring PD but unable to perform their own treatment because of comorbidities, physical disabilities, or psychosocial problems; prevalent, previous autonomous PD patients who have lost their independence because of advanced age or an increased burden of comorbidities; or prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients switched from HD to aPD because of their own preference, failure of vascular access for HD, or an inability to tolerate HD. We believe that aPD in the future will prove to be a safe and feasible complementary alternative to in-center HD for the growing group of frail, elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease. © 2007 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

N2  - New advances in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) change the perspective from which many of its features and treatment are viewed. Calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D have been shown to be important determinants of survival associated with kidney diseases. Now ROD dependent and independent of these factors is linked to survival more than just skeletal frailty. This review focuses on recent discoveries that renal injury impairs skeletal anabolism decreasing the osteoblast compartment of the skeleton and consequent bone formation. This discovery and the discovery that PTH regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche alters our view of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) from that of a disease to that of a necessary adaptation to renal injury that goes awry. Furthermore, ROD is shown to be an underappreciated factor in the level of the serum phosphorus in CKD. The discovery and the elucidation of the mechanism of hyperphosphatemia as a cardiovascular risk in CKD change the view of ROD. It is now recognized as more than a skeletal disorder, it is an important component of the mortality of CKD that can be treated. © Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Publishing.

N2  - In diabetes-related amputations, the risk of nonhealing or infection of a wound and the need for revision are increased. Medical treatment before amputation should optimize general and local conditions including the regression of edema, the control of infection, and the optimization of glucoregulation. A major argument for foot-sparing surgery is the poor functional recovery after major limb amputation. Diabetic patients are frail, with an increased postoperative morbidity and mortality after major amputation. Factors detrimental to functional outcome are advanced age, end-stage renal disease, dementia, and above-knee amputation. A multidisciplinary approach is required to optimize the results of diabetes-related amputations. The authors discuss medical and technical aspects that may reduce the failure of minor or major diabetes-related amputations. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - In this paper, we propose a model for medical costs recorded at regular time intervals, e.g. every month, as repeated measures in the presence of a terminating event, such as death. Prior models have related monthly medical costs to time since entry, with extra costs at the final observations at the time of death. Our joint model for monthly medical costs and survival time incorporates two important new features. First, medical cost and survival may be correlated because more 'frail' patients tend to accumulate medical costs faster and die earlier. A joint random effects model is proposed to account for the correlation between medical costs and survival by a shared random effect. Second, monthly medical costs usually increase during the time period prior to death because of the intensive care for dying patients. We present a method for estimating the pattern of cost prior to death, which is applicable if the pattern can be characterized as an additive effect that is limited to a fixed time interval, say b units of time before death. This 'turn back time' method for censored observations censors cost data b units of time before the actual censoring time, while keeping the actual censoring time for the survival data. Time-dependent covariates can be included. Maximum likelihood estimation and inference are carried out through a Monte Carlo EM algorithm with a Metropolis-Hastings sampler in the E-step. An analysis of monthly outpatient EPO medical cost data for dialysis patients is presented to illustrate the proposed methods. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - Anemia, defined as a lower than normal level of serum hemoglobin, is a common condition among the elderly, and it is often attributed to normal consequences of aging. Anemia in older individuals is frequently undiagnosed and untreated. The impact of untreated anemia can be severe, including increased risk of death, loss of independent functioning, physical decline, falls and fractures, frailty, cognitive decline, cardiovascular events and added economic burden to society. Treatment is available for many types of anemia. For anemia caused by nutritional deficiencies, treatments include simple dietary modifications and/or iron supplementation (e.g., iron, vitamin B12 or folate). Transfusion or erythropoietic agents (e.g., epoetin alfa, epoetin beta and darbepoetin alfa) are used for anemia of chronic diseases and their treatments (e.g., cancer/chemotherapy and chronic kidney disease). Evidence that highlights the benefits of erythropoietic therapies and their use in the treatment of anemia of chronic disease in the elderly is reviewed in this article. © 2006 Future Drugs Ltd.

N2  - Background and objective: Although therapeutic failure may be a common cause of drug-related morbidity in older adults, few studies have focused on this problem. The study objective was to determine the frequency and types of, and the factors associated with, therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients, using a new instrument named the Therapeutic Failure Questionnaire (TFQ). Methods: The sample included 106 frail, hospitalised elderly patients enrolled in a 1-year-long health service intervention trial at 11 Veterans Affairs Medical Centres. The TFQ was developed by a team of clinicial geriatricians and tested for reliability by two clinical pharmacists and a geriatrician on a sample of 32 patients. To establish validity, a geriatrician retrospectively reviewed the computerised medication records and clinical charts for these patients and applied the TFQ to determine probable therapeutic failures at the time of hospital admission. Results: Inter- and intra-rater reliability for the TFQ were very good (κ = 0.82 for both). Overall, 11% of patients had one or more probable therapeutic failures (TFQ scores between 4 and 7) leading to hospitalisation. Cardiopulmonary disease was a common 'indicator' of therapeutic failure and was often the result of non-adherence. The only factor associated with therapeutic failure occurrence was severe chronic kidney disease (crude odds ratio 5.87; 95% CI 1.20, 28.69; p = 0.01). Conclusions: The TFQ was able to identify several cases of probable therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients. Non-adherence to effective therapies for chronic serious cardiopulmonary disease was a common cause of therapeutic failure and represents a target for interventions to reduce hospitalisation. Further research on the occurrence, risk factors for and types of therapeutic failure is needed in a larger cohort of older non-veterans. © 2006 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

N2  - Ocular contusions are common and cause significant morbidity. The mechanism of ocular contusion is a decrease in the length of the anterioposterior axis whereas the transversal axis increases. Epidemiology data shows that young men are most injured in relation with sports, aggression, work, or car or work accidents. Injury to the ocular surface (conjunctiva and cornea) is minor. The iris is very frail, usually leading to hyphema which can progress to glaucoma. A cataract can appear after a contusion but usually years after the trauma. Final visual acuity can be compromised by retinal contusion or retinal detachment (due to a retinal dehiscence or post-traumatic dialysis). The worst outcome is optic neuropathy. The most difficult task is to predict visual acuity after the initial ocular lesion. © 2006. Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - Anemia is currently defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a hemoglobin (Hb) level <13 g/dL in men and <12 g/dL in women. While estimates vary widely, nearly one quarter of community-based octagenerians and one half of the chronically ill elderly have Hb levels that satisfy a diagnosis of anemia according to these criteria. A growing body of evidence has linked adverse events with even "mild" anemia or low-normal Hb in the elderly. Recent studies suggest strongly that aging is associated with dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, most notably interleukin-6 (IL-6), which may negatively impact hematopoiesis, either by inhibition of erythropoietin (EPO) production or interaction with EPO receptors. Anemia in older individuals is associated with a very wide range of complications, including increased risk for mortality, cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, longer hospitalization for elective procedures and comorbid conditions, reduced bone density, and falls and fractures. Not surprisingly, anemia also has a significant effect on quality of life (QOL) in the elderly. Most anemia in older individuals results from iron deficiency, chronic inflammation, or chronic kidney disease, or it may be unexplained. Future research on anemia in the elderly should focus on the age-related physiologic changes underlying this condition and whether anemia correction can reduce anemia-associated risks, and improve QOL. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Coronary artery disease has a significantly higher prevalence in chronic dialysis patients compared to the general population, explained by a cluster of non-specific and specific (uremia-associated) cardiovascular risk factors, typical for these patients. Nephrologists and cardiovascular surgeons worldwide are rather reluctant to offer CABG to dialysis patients, because of concerns about higher risks associated with this procedure in this frail population. However, there is an increasing opinion supporting a more aggressive management of coronary artery disease in uremic individuals. To illustrate this "positive attitude", we report here the first dialysis patient ever treated by CABG in Iaşi; his good outcome was both rewarding and encouraging for us all.

N2  - This study investigated mortality in 568 individuals from the Goessel Mennonite community in rural central Kansas. There were three main objectives to this research: 1) characterize mortality trends within a biologically well-defined Mennonite community; 2) determine what biochemical, morphological, and physiological risk factors could be related to all-cause mortality, stratified by age and sex; and 3) compare these results to previously described variables that were associated with both biological age and mortality in this population. Mortality data were obtained from three sources: Kansas Vital Records, the Social Security death index, and church records. In total, 221 (39%) individuals were found to have died in this population between January 1980-June 2002. Analogous to the larger US population, the three leading causes of death in this community were heart disease, cancer, and stroke, accounting for 60% of all deaths. Besides advancing age, the greatest biological risk factor in this population was decreased amounts of albumin in men (relative risk, 2.47), potentially indicating underreported cases of either chronic kidney disease or frailty syndrome for males. Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated that increased amounts of total cholesterol may provide a protective effect for elderly individuals. We conclude, based on the previously described heritability of both albumin (h2 = 0.40) and total cholesterol (h2 = 0.50) in this population, that underlying genetic factors associated with both chronic degenerative diseases and biological aging may have important implications for understanding mortality patterns in this community. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

N2  - Anemia is a common comorbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD). As the diseased kidney loses its ability to produce the erythropoietin essential to the production of hemoglobin, anemia ensues. The age-related rise in CKD makes anemia in CKD a problem of increasing prevalence among residents of long-term care facilities. CKD refers to the entire continuum of renal disease that progresses from mildly impaired kidney function (stage 1, glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2) to significant deterioration, requiring dialysis or kidney transplant in what is categorized as stage 5 (GFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2). The definition of anemia is controversial. The WHO defines anemia as hemoglobin <13 g/dL for men and <12 g/dL for women. The National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, which is the criteria used for Medicare reimbursement, defines anemia in adult men and postmenopausal women as hemoglobin <12 g/dL, or <11 g/dL in a premenopausal woman. © 2006 American Medical Directors Association.

N2  - ◆ Objective: To describe basic demographics and clinical outcomes among elderly end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients physically dependent on a caregiver and maintained on an assisted automated peritoneal dialysis (AAPD) program. ◆ Design: Retrospective single-center study based on patient records and data flies. ◆ Setting: University Hospital. ◆ Patients: 64 physically dependent AAPD patients followed for 1.012 treatment months. Assistance and care was delivered by 52 briefly trained teams of visiting nurses or nursing home staff. ◆ Result: Crude 1-year survival was 58% and 2-year survival was 48%. Crude 1- and 2-year survivals, excluding deaths within 90 days, were 66% and 54% respectively. We found no significant effect on survival by main causesof ESRD, gender, age, late referral, need for acute start, social isolation, physical dependency on help at inclusion, or residence in a nursing home. 10% of patient-days on AAPD were spent in hospital. 13 (20%) of the patients were converted permanently to hemodialysis due to PD technique failure. The incidence of peritonitis was 1 in every 25.3 treatment-months. ◆ Conclusions: AAPD may be a feasible and safe option for renal replacement therapy for frail, elderly, and physically dependent patients with ESRD. Despite the special patient selection for this AAPD program, we achieved results of international standards for patient survival, PD technique survival, and incidence of acute peritonitis. These results do not justify withholding dialysis from this group of patients. Copyright © 2005 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis Printed in Canada. All rights reserved.

N2  - The prevalence of uraemic dialysed patients aged 75 or more is progressively increasing. These patients suffer from the peculiar clinical complexity of the uraemic syndrome. Therefore they are severely frail for many clinical and physiopathological reasons. The cooperation between Gerontologists and Nephrologists is strongly needed to identified the reasons and the treatment of such a deep frialty of elderly patients, as well as to properly treat the complexity of the uraemia. Data from the Registry of the Nephrological ward in Trieste suggest that the patients survival is strongly determined by an ADL and IADL dependency. However the comorbidities in very old patients aged 85 or more are rather uncommon: the principle that age cannot be considered an absolute discriminant reason for any diagnostic or therapeutic intervention is strongly supported by these data.

N2  - A new category of patients aged >75 yrs, namely the elderly, is now being freely admitted to hemodialysis (HD) and this category is becoming predominant. The absence of systematic studies makes this patient category almost indistinguishable from other categories, even though its peculiarity is now evident. At least 30-40% of individuals in this age bracket are expected to be dependent and/or frail, but the incidence of frailty is likely to be higher in the elderly undergoing HD. Due to severe physical and/or mental impairment and often because of strong social hardships, these patients rarely experience clinical stability and are dependent on third parties for their survival. Their care produces complex problems for welfare services and this has proved responsible for modifying the organization of renal care units. These repeated patient admissions to hospital are filling nephrology facilities, and the dialysis management -- mainly concerning outpatients -- requires a much greater use of facilities and staff than normal if compared to average dialysis patients. In 112 elderly patients consecutively admitted to the dialysis program over a period of 10 yrs, we identified 35 dependent or frail patients (31.2%), even taking into consideration only extreme degrees of infirmity. Dependence proved to be the only clinical parameter associated with survival (mortality at 6 months 23.6 vs. 10.6%, p<0.01; Kaplan-Meier survival curves, p<0.03 log-rank test), while comorbidities -- in particular cardiovascular -- that usually affect dialysis mortality rates, did not seem to be discriminating risk factors in the elderly. More precisely, with the confirmation of these data through wider case studies, the idea will be reinforced that, also in dialysis, the elderly must be constantly monitored for dependence and frailty, as is the case in any exclusively geriatric field. Prevention, as well as a therapeutic approach specifically modeled on these conditions, could help to improve the prognosis of this patient category, which is particularly difficult to deal with and is becoming predominant in dialysis units.

N2  - Accelerated failure time models with a shared random component are described, and are used to evaluate the effect of explanatory factors and different transplant centres on survival times following kidney transplantation. Different combinations of the distribution of the random effects and baseline hazard function are considered and the fit of such models to the transplant data is critically assessed. A mixture model that combines short- and long-term components of a hazard function is then developed, which provides a more flexible model for the hazard function. The model can incorporate different explanatory variables and random effects in each component. The model is straightforward to fit using standard statistical software, and is shown to be a good fit to the transplant data. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

N2  - The incidence of psychopathology, particularly depression, is high in dialysed elderly patients whereas their perceived level of health in the mental domain is similar to that of a non-dialysed and, even younger, population. Although the losses associated with advancing years, chronic disease and then entry into dialysis renders the psyche of elderly people frail, they do not strictly add in negative terms: their psychological reserve or resignation helps very elderly people to tolerate dialysis and its constraints. However, maintaining functional autonomy (ability to provide for one's fundamental needs and preserve leisure activities) while remaining independent to take decisions (particularly in controlling ways of receiving assistance) and preserving close relationships emerge as major determinant factors of the quality of life of very elderly dialysed patients. Added to the dependency due to dialysis, losses in these domains very often represent a turning point by changing the patient's identity, predisposing to the development of relationship problems, leading the patient to question his self-esteem or even resulting in psychological dependency, which itself adversely affects the quality of life. These mechanisms of psychopathology may not hide the possibility of an underlying dementia.

N2  - Background. Renal function declines with age, but little is known about the extent of renal insufficiency among the institutionalized elderly. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a large sample of elderly adults living in long-term care facilities, and to compare two commonly used methods for estimating GFR. Methods. A total of 9931 residents aged 65 years and older participated in a retrospective cross-sectional study of 87 long-term care facilities in Ontario. GFR was estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) equations. The prevalence of low GFR, using the Cockcroft-Gault equation (<30 mL/min), was compared with the MDRD equation (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Results. A total of 17.0% (95% CI 15.6 to 18.5) of men and 14.4% (95% CI 13.6 to 15.3) of women had a serum creatinine concentration above the laboratory reported upper reference limit of normal. The prevalence of both elevated serum creatinine and low GFR were observed to increase with age (P < 0.0001). The Cockcroft-Gault equation produced a consistently lower estimate of GFR than did the MDRD equation, a discrepancy most pronounced in the oldest residents. Among all men, a low GFR was more prevalent using the Cockcroft-Gault (10.3%, 95% CI 9.2 to 11.5) than MDRD (3.5%, 95% CI 2.8 to 4.2) equation, with a similar difference also seen in women (23.3%, 95% CI 22.4 to 24.3 versus 4.0%, 95% CI 3.6 to 4.5, respectively). Of all residents whose Cockcroft-Gault estimated GFR was under 30 mL/min, 14.7% (95% CI 13.2 to 16.3) were found to have GFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 according to the MDRD equation. Conclusion. Age-associated renal impairment is common among elderly long-term care residents, but there exists a clear discrepancy between the Cockcroft-Gault and MDRD equations in predicting GFR. Consideration should be given to medication dose adjustment, based on a practical estimate of GFR. However clarification is needed about which method, if either, is most valid among the frail elderly. Complex patient and societal issues surrounding advanced care directives, treatments associated with renal insufficiency, and, if and when to initiate dialysis, require further attention.

N2  - As people live longer, chronic illness care will consume an ever-larger part of a nation's financial resources. With the 'baby-boomer' generation reaching retirement age beginning in 2011, there will be an increased demand for chronic services/care in the population aged 65 years and older. Innovative approaches to quality care must be sought, while understanding the financial costs associated with the delivery of such care to the geriatric population. Elderly persons utilize more physical resources and it is important to identify early those beneficiaries who would benefit medically from intervention. Disease management is built on a model of integrated care, with each member of the healthcare team working together toward a common set of objectives. The ultimate goal is to keep the patient functioning well in an outpatient setting, thus avoiding the high debility and costs associated with hospitalization and institutionalization. Creating such a system requires a substantial investment in infrastructure. The concept of 'spending $5.00 to save $10.00' must be incorporated into the planning process. In chronically ill seniors there is a need for care as well as cure, which involves improving function and quality of life (QOL) for the frail elders by paying attention to the psychological and socioeconomic status in addition to the physical condition. Small gains in function can mean large gains in patients' QOL. Reducing the progression of functional decline among the physically frail who live at home is a goal. Home visits are a critical component of the total care delivered. Changing physician behavior to accept the tenets of disease management requires education in advance of launching such a program. There must be healthcare team buy-in for a program to achieve success. Personnel requirements include senior nurses, social workers, physical therapists and nutritionists, supported by a sophisticated information technology system. Components of an information technology system must allow for adequate data collection and subsequent generation of reports. Continuous quality improvement will occur only if such a system is in place. While the average chronologic age of the patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is almost 62 years, the physiologic age is much older. Therefore, ESRD serves as a model for chronic illness that affects a geriatric population and the benefits achieved by a disease management approach to this chronic disease are noted. Disease management improved glycemic control in the ESRD patient with diabetes mellitus by establishing a protocol for frequency of measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c). For this population at risk, a decreased hospitalization rate for diabetic complications resulted from this initiative. Also, a vascular access initiative in the described ESRD disease management program resulted in an increase in the creation of arterio-venous fistulas and a decrease in the placement of tunneled-cuff catheters. Fistula creation was associated with less infections and access thrombosis compared with catheter use for access. QOL improved for these patients with ESRD because of decreased hospitalization rate for access-related issues. Significant cost savings were achieved because of fewer hospital admissions and a decrease in the number of bed days per year. The lessons learned from the ESRD model can help in developing future disease management programs for the geriatric population.

N2  - For many reasons patients on hemodialysis treatment have a low physical capacity. In this study the physical capacity was tested in 41 patients with chronic renal failure during their first weeks on hemodialysis and after 18 months of treatment. Compared to reference values the test result showed a significantly decreased physical strength, endurance and balance capacity already at the start of the dialysis. The patients were tested and got individually tailored information at the kidney unit and received some physical training outside the hospital. After 18 months the result for the group was not improved in spite of the fact that the 11 most frail patients had died. Diabetic and elderly patients had a significantly lower result than the rest of the patients. Future research will show, if more regular exercise (predialytic) individually programmed by a specially trained physiotherapist who can obtain up-to-date medical information as working in close contact to a dialysis unit, will further improve the condition of these patients.

N2  - The emergence of the sub-speciality geriatric nephrology is an exciting development for the future. The main objectives should be to maximise patient independence and minimise deterioration and learn dependent behaviour in this population. To achieve these goals a holistic approach needs to be taken, to the patient, their environment and the efficacy of such units, and this can only be achieved using a multi-disciplinary team approach. In the creation of a geriatric nephrology unit it is important to identify the factors that cause frailty and, if possible, modify or prevent the initial decline using nutritional and other interventions. This requires careful monitoring, not only using the traditional markers of renal disease including urea and creatinine, but also using instruments that measure functional ability. These issues are discussed under the headings prevention, documentation and planning.

N2  - The present study was conducted to investigate depression in caregivers of elderly hemodialysis patients. Caregivers answered a self-administered questionnaire about various factors that may affect their depression, and also completed a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale evaluation (CESD). The frail elderly who received regular nurse visits were used as controls. Compared with the caregivers of controls, those of hemodialysis patients spent less time on caregiving and had more time to go out unaccompanied by their patients. Males were numerous among hemodialysis patients than in the controls. Compared with the controls, hemodialysis patients were less likely to be older old (80 years old and more), diagnosed as demented or severely limited in activities of daily living (ADL). On the other hand, we did not find any significant difference between the two groups with regard to either the prevalence of depression, the rate of those who experienced any life event such as to cause depression within 6 months (e.g., death of family member), duration of caregiving or time looking after patients. Caregivers of hemodialyis patients may feel a heavy burden because they are obliged to play an important role in supporting patients on dialysis. They seem to need more social support regardless of whether or not their patients suffer from dementia.

N2  - Emphysematous pyelonephritis most often presents as an acute medical emergency, typically in a septic diabetic patient with acute renal failure. The management of this condition has traditionally been surgical, with nephrectomy. However, some recent reports have described successful medical interventions. We describe a case of acute bilateral emphysematous pyelonephritis in a frail patient not suitable for bilateral nephrectomy and long-term dialysis. This condition was managed medically, not surgically, with intensive antibiotic and circulatory support. The outcome was complete recovery after months of hospital-based treatment. We discuss the management of this rare but important condition in detail. (C) 2000 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

N2  - The 'demographic imperative' of a progressively aging society will place unprecedented demands on the health care system in the 21st century. Although improved education, public health measures, personal lifestyles, and health care will result in a large proportion of those born surviving to old age in robust health and vitality, the sheer numbers of 'baby-boomers' who will become the elderly and the inevitable association between aging and the associated multiple, especially chronic diseases and physiological impairments of old age will require more efficient and more effective systems of health care to meet the needs of the aging population. Generalists, specialists, and medical and surgical subspecialists will play important roles in meeting these needs, often in the multidisciplinary mode. Geriatricians will directly provide but a small minoritty of the care, focusing upon education, research, and consultation and in delivering primary care to the frail elderly and especially in long term care. Collaboration with subspecialists will be frequent in all these domains. Nephrologists, who already practice multidisciplinary team care of frail, complicated, chronically ill patients with end-stage renal disease, have much to contribute as their patient population progressively grows in numbers and age. Hence geriatricians and have much to learn from and contribute to each other in addressing the 'age wave' of the 21st century.

N2  - PURPOSE: This qualitative study investigated diabetes care management among family members of American Indian elders with self-care limitations. Focus groups were used to examine the reasons for and content of diabetes care management, the challenges faced, and the support services needed. METHODS: Five focus groups were conducted with family caregivers from six tribes. Caregivers' responses related to care management were identified and categorized into themes. RESULTS: Participants reported that they provided assistance with a wide range of diabetes care tasks (e.g., skin and wound care, in-home dialysis) depending on the elder's level of impairment. Caregivers described three major challenges related to diabetes care management: (1) anxiety about in-home care, (2) coping with psychosocial issues, and (3) decision making and communication problems with other family members. They emphasized the importance of developing a care routine for successful diabetes management. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, we suggest areas where diabetes educators can assist American Indian family caregivers in meeting the needs of frail elders in the home.

Emphasis is placed on awareness of the possibility that non-specific symptoms may be harbingers of renal failure and that early detection and management may be critical in salvaging kidney function. The place of diet and blood pressure control is discussed. If end stage renal failure supervenes, renal placement therapy is needed and the value of dialysis and transplantation is addressed in the frequently elderly and frail patients who require management.

N2  - This paper charts the development of haemodialysis, the cornerstone of renal replacement therapy (RRT). It has enabled patients with end-stage renal failure to survive for years, in many cases with a surprisingly good quality of life. Through technological advances, RRT can be offered to patients who are older and more frail. Many have intercurrent comorbid illness. Such patients can have good quality of life, but their survival is shorter since they are likely to succumb early to comorbid illnesses. The challenge to nephrologists is to provide treatment based on exacting standards for all those patients who can benefit, yet to maintain cost-effectiveness. There is increasing recognition that, however good the technology underpinning dialysis, what justifies the cost and commitment that dialysis entails is the provision for the patient of a satisfactory quality of life.

This paper considers an intermediate solution, that is, a nonparametric function that is reasonably smooth. This is accomplished by a Bayesian model in which the conditional proportional hazards model is used with a correlated prior process for the baseline hazard. The posterior likelihood based on data, as well as the prior process, is similar to the discretized penalized likelihood for the frailty model. The methodology is exemplified with the recurrent kidney infections data of McGilchrist and Aisbett (1991, Biometrics 47, 461-466), in which the times to infections within the same patients are expected to be correlated. The reanalysis of the data has shown that the estimates of the parameters of interest and the associated standard errors depend on the prior knowledge about the smoothness of the baseline hazard.

N2  - Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic dialysis have higher mortality in the United States than in many other countries. While increasing age, white race, male sex, and/or diabetes are considered risk factors for survival, few studies of older dialysis patients have simultaneously considered multiple predictor variables and their interactions. Using information contained in the 1982 to 1986 ESRD Network 20 database for Georgia and South Carolina, we studied hospitalizations and survival of 1,354 blacks and 965 whites who were age 60 years or older when they began dialysis therapy. Survival time was modeled using the Cox life- table regression method. Older blacks' median age at dialysis initiation was 67.4, compared with 68.7 for older whites (P = 0.001). Blacks were more likely than whites (P < 0.001) to have hypertension-related or diabetes- related ESRD. White patients experienced approximately 25% more hospitalization when adjustment was made for patient-days at risk. Separate multivariate survival models were required for patients with diabetes-related versus non-diabetes-related ESRD. Among diabetics, mortality was higher among whites and among patients who were older when they began dialysis. Among patients with non-diabetes-related ESRD, mortality was higher among patients who were older when they began dialysis, but the age effect was much stronger for white males. Our hospitalization and mortality data support the view that unmeasured severity (or frailty) differences characterize white as compared with black dialysis patients. Among non-diabetes-related ESRD patients, the age effect on survival was more severe in white males than in blacks or in white females. The high mortality we observed among older dialysis patients in Georgia and South Carolina warrants further study; the data may in part reflect patients' lower socioeconomic status compared with age, race, and sex-matched controls.

N2  - Thus, although the prognosis for small vessel vasculitis affecting the kidney has improved from almost inevitable death 30 years ago, through a 30-35% 5-year survival 10-15 years ago, many problems remain. Although it seems likely that the more intense immunosuppression used in most units over the past 10-15 years has improved immediate survival, a number of these elderly and often frail patients die directly as a result of these treatment regimens; in our present series, 5/16 deaths (31%) could be related directly to immunosuppression. In some patients extrarenal complications of the vasculitis, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, still may lead to early death. The relative roles (if any) of methylprednisolone and/or plasma exchange in treatment of renal vasculitis are not clear yet, although a recent controlled trial in patients with crescentic nephritis, mainly the result of small vessel renal vasculitis, showed a modest benefit from plasma exchange in addition to prednisolone and cyclophosphamide, but only in those patients requiring dialysis. In the longer term, we do not know for how long, with what agent and with what intensity immunosuppression must be maintained. In our series, in which most patients were maintained on modest immunosuppression for many years, relapse of the vasculitis was almost absent, suggesting some merit in this strategy. We used azathioprine rather than intermittent intravenous cyclophosphamide, as others have advocated; there are no data to choose between these regimens at the moment, although even in this relatively elderly population long-term oral cyclophosphamide is better avoided because of risks to the bladder, gonadal toxicity and oncogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
