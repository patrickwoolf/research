AB  - Background: The National Heart Failure UK Audit (2011/2012) recommends cardiology services should manage in-hospital heart failure, demonstrating better survival outcomes. However frail older peoples' needs were not reflected; cognitive impairment and multi-morbidity were excluded. Our objective was to survey our older patients' characteristics and management for acute heart failure admission.Sampling methods: We sampled forty-five patients admitted to the Older Persons' Unit with heart failure (January-March 2013) collecting data from case notes and discharge summaries, adapting the National Heart Failure Audit tool adding domains including cognition, non-cardiac co-morbidities and dependency.Results: Mean age 86yrs old, mean length of stay 22 days, 62% (28/45) had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Most lived alone 62% (28/45). 32% (14/44) scored less than 24/30 on mini-mental state examination. Non-cardiac diseases were common; dementia 22% (10/45), chest disease 22% (10/45), diabetes mellitus 24% (11/45), stroke 18% (8/45), chronic kidney disease 31% (14/45). Admission echocardiography performed in 67% (30/45), brain natriuretic peptide level in 71% (32/45). In patients with reduced ejection fraction, 85% (11/13) were discharged on a beta-blocker. Only 38% (5/13) were discharged on an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor; of those who were not 50% (4/8) had significant hypotension, 38% (3/8) had significant acute kidney injury.Key conclusions: Cognitive impairment and co-morbidity burden was common. Not everyone received evidence-based medical therapy, mostly clinically justified. Without considering co-morbidity, frailty and medication intolerance, streamlining services to a specialist approach may be detrimental to the complex frail patient. The National Heart Failure Audit should incorporate these aspects to reflect older patients' needs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older dialysis patients have a high burden of mortality and morbidity. Frailty and functional disability are common. One of the main determinants of functional disability in nondialysis populations is acute hospitalization. Such episodes are predictive of increased mortality and a future need for long-term care. Based on the high prevalence of disability in the dialysis population, we undertook a pilot study to determine functional impairment at the time of admission and again at 1 week after discharge. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prevalent dialysis patients older than 65 years admitted to a single acute-care institution during a 3-month period. OUTCOMES: The proportion of dialysis patients with difficulty with activities of daily living at baseline and 1 week after discharge. MEASUREMENT: Basic activities of daily living; Lawton Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score; timed up-and-go and handgrip tests; Trails A & B, and the clock test. RESULTS: At the time of admission, only 8 of 35 individuals reported being independent with basic activities of daily living. None of the patients was independent with instrumental activities of daily living. At 1 week after discharge, patients showed deterioration in all aspects of function except the ability to use the telephone and manage their financial affairs. A total of 73.3% of patients (95% confidence interval, 54.1 to 87.7) experienced a decline in personal functional independence in association with hospitalization. LIMITATIONS: This is a pilot study with a small number of patients who were studied at only 2 times (admission and 1 week after discharge). CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that hospitalization is associated with a high rate of disability in elderly dialysis patients. Further study is required to determine whether the functional deterioration seen with hospitalization improves over time.

AB  - Background: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).Study Design: Observational study.Setting& Participants: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study.Outcome: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy.Measurements: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.Results: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was 51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes, eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a 2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of frailty compared with GFR(cys) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or dialysis therapy.Limitations: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal relationships between CKD and frailty.Conclusions: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) disease management can improve health outcomes for older community dwelling patients with heart failure. HF disease management has not been studied in skilled nursing facilities, a major site of transitional care for older adults. Methods and anticipated results: The objective of this trial is to investigate if a HF- disease management program (HF-DMP) in skilled nursing facilities (SNF)s will decrease all-cause rehospitalizations for the first 60 days post-SNF admission. The trial is a randomized cluster trial to be conducted in 12 for-profit SNF in the greater Cleveland area. The study population is inclusive of patients with HF regardless of ejection fraction but excludes those patients on dialysis and with a life expectancy of 6 months or less. The HF-DMP includes 7 elements considered standard of care for patients with HF documentation of left ventricular function, tracking of weight and symptoms, medication titration, discharge instructions, 7-day follow-up appointment post-SNF discharge, and patient education. The HF-DMP is conducted by a research nurse tasked with adhering to each element of the program and regularly audited to maintain fidelity of the program. Additional outcomes include health status, self-care management, and discharge destination. Conclusions: The SNF-Connect Trial is the first trial of its kind to assess if a HF-DMP will improve outcomes for patients in SNFs. This trial will provide evidence on the effectiveness of HF-DMP to improve outcomes for older frail HF patients undergoing postacute rehabilitation.

AB  - Evidence has recently been building that the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent contributor to decline in physical and cognitive functions in older adults. CKD affects 45% of persons older than 70 years of age and can double the risk for physical impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and frailty. To increase awareness of this relatively new concept of CKD as a risk factor for accelerated aging, we review studies on the association of CKD with physical function, frailty, and cognitive function. We also present a summary of the proposed mechanisms for these associations.

AB  - Long-term care will increasingly shift from institutions to home and community based services. Using data from a Medicaid home care waiver program in South Carolina, the Community Long-Term Care (CLTC) program, we evaluated differences in frailty and service use among CLTC clients between 1995 (n = 3,748) and 2005 (n = 9,157). The expectation was that CLTC clients had become more frail in that period, and had greater access to services in the community, results that might suggest the CLTC program had helped individuals to avoid institutionalization. Frailty measures included acute and chronic conditions, other health conditions, and activities of daily living (ADL). We evaluated the percentage of clients using services, and service use intensity. A large majority of clients in both years were impaired in at least four ADL. In 2005, CLTC clients were significantly more likely to have chronic conditions, including hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, diabetes, and renal failure (all p < 0.05). Clients were significantly more likely to receive specific services in 2005, including physical therapy, dialysis, and oxygen (all p < 0.05). Results suggest CLTC participants were more frail in 2005 than in 1995. This may reflect a successful effort to help individuals age in place in the community, delaying institutionalization. States may be able to control increases in Medicaid long-term care costs through home care programs that delay institutionalization.

AB  - In diabetes-related amputations, the risk of nonhealing or infection of a wound and the need for revision are increased. Medical treatment before amputation should optimize general and local conditions including the regression of edema, the control of infection, and the optimization of glucoregulation. A major argument for foot-sparing surgery is the poor functional recovery after major limb amputation. Diabetic patients are frail, with an increased postoperative morbidity and mortality after major amputation. Factors detrimental to functional outcome are advanced age, end-stage renal disease, dementia, and above-knee amputation. A multidisciplinary approach is required to optimize the results of diabetes-related amputations. The authors discuss medical and technical aspects that may reduce the failure of minor or major diabetes-related amputations. Copyright © 2008 by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As people age and live for longer they are more likely to develop comorbid conditions including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This paper discusses the treatment options for stage 5 CKD including haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, transplantation or conservative management, also known as supportive care, for those who decide not to undertake dialysis. It also highlights the complexity of offering a treatment such as dialysis, viewed as a requirement to prolong life, without which people will die, which is unable to restore the kidneys to normal function, only substitute for. Dialysis is also an arduous therapy known to shorten life. In the past refusal of dialysis was viewed as akin to suicide and it is not until more recently that the needs and experiences of those who decide not to embark on dialysis have started to be recognized. Clearly dialysis is not suitable for all, particularly those who are frail with multiple comorbidities and so supportive and palliative care may be a more suitable option for some.

AB  - Pain is one of the most common symptoms among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and is often under recognized and not adequately managed in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Barriers to adequate pain management include poor awareness of the problem, insufficient medical education, fears of possible drug-related side effects, and common misconceptions about the inevitability of pain in elderly and HD patients. Caregivers working in HD should be aware of the possible consequences of inadequate pain assessment and management. Common pain syndromes in HD patients include musculoskeletal diseases and metabolic neuropathies, associated with typical intradialytic pain. Evaluating the etiology, nature, and intensity of pain is crucial for choosing the correct analgesic. A mechanism-based approach to pain management may result in a better outcome. Pharmacokinetic considerations on clearance alterations and possible toxicity in patients with ESRD should drive the right analgesic prescription. Comorbidities and polymedications may increase the risk of drug-drug interactions, therefore drug metabolism should be taken into account when selecting analgesic drugs. Automedication is common among HD patients but should be avoided to reduce the risk of hazardous drug administration. Further research is warranted to define the efficacy and safety of analgesic drugs and techniques in the context of patients with ESRD as generalizing information from studies conducted in the general population could be inappropriate and potentially dangerous. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for the management of complex pain syndromes in frail patients, such as those suffering from ESRD.

AB  - Context: It has become commonplace to use family caregivers as proxy responders where patients are unable to provide information about their symptoms and concerns to health care providers.Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the degree of concordance between patients' and family members' reports of patient symptoms and concerns at end of life.Methods: Sample dyads included a mix of patients residing at home, in a nursing home, in a long-term care facility, or in hospice. Diagnoses included patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 75), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 52), end-stage renal disease (n = 42), and institutionalized, cognitively intact frail elderly (n = 49). Dyads completed the Patient Dignity Inventory (PDI), the modified Structured Interview Assessment of Symptoms and Concerns in Palliative Care, and Graham and Longman's two-item Quality of Life Scale.Results: Concordance was less than 70% for seven of the 25 PDI items, with the lowest concordance (65.1%) for the item "not being able to continue with my usual routines." For all but one PDI item, discordance was in the direction of family members reporting that the patient was worse off than the patient had indicated. Where discordance was observed on the Structured Interview Assessment of Symptoms and Concerns in Palliative Care and Quality of Life Scales, the trend toward family members overreporting patient distress and poor quality of life continued.Conclusion: Understanding discordance between patients and family member reports of symptoms and concerns is a valuable step toward minimizing patient and family burden at end of life.

AB  - Objective: To assess the frailty level of elderly people with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study involving 60 participants and carried out at a Renal Replacement Therapy Unit. The Edmonton Frail Scale, translated and validated to Portuguese, was used as the instrument of research. Results: Around 35.0% of the elderly showed no frailty, 26.7% were vulnerable, 20.0% showed mild frailty, 13.3% moderate frailty and 5.0% severe frailty. Conclusion: The frailty level of elderly people with chronic kidney disease undergoing hemodialysis was high and the number of elderly people who are vulnerable to frailty was also high.

AB  - Unlabelled: Although sarcopenia is thought to underlie the manifestations of frailty, association of frailty with measures of body composition is underinvestigated.Methods: Eighty hemodialysis patients were included in the study. Performance-based frailty (PbF) used gait speed over 20 feet and 5 sit-to-stand (1 point each for lowest quintile) for the physical components of the frailty phenotype plus exhaustion (Short Form-36 [SF-36] vitality score <55) and physical activity (lowest quintile of weekly kcal energy expenditure on leisure activity on the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly questionnaire; 1 point). Function-based frailty (FbF) defined by questionnaire measures of physical functioning (SF-36 Physical Function score <75; 1 point), exhaustion, and physical activity as for PbF. A score of 2 or greater was defined as frail. Outcomes related to muscle size included muscle area of the contractile tissue of the anterior tibialis and quadriceps muscles using magnetic resonance imaging, phase angle using bioimpedance analysis, lean body mass using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and body mass index (BMI). Linear regression was used to analyze associations between frailty and muscle size, with and without sex and age covariates.Results: Fifty-nine percent of individuals met PbF criteria, 63% met FbF criteria, and 55% met both. In univariate analysis, PbF and FbF were associated with smaller muscle area of the quadriceps, smaller phase angle, and higher BMI. Associations remained significant for the quadriceps after adjustment for age and sex. The magnitude of association of PbF with quadriceps muscle area was greater than 10 years of age (-30.3 cm(2)P = .02 vs. -6.6 cm(2)P < .0001) in multivariate analysis. There was no significant association between either measure of frailty and other measures of body composition after adjustment for age and sex.Conclusion: Frailty was associated with measurements related to muscle size in a population of individuals with chronic kidney disease, a known contributor to muscle wasting.

AB  - Background: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength, body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were assessed.Methods: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12 months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us), endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition (DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.Results: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30 to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).Conclusions: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either worse endothelial function or mortality.

AB  - Purpose: Frail patients are known to experience poor outcomes. Nevertheless, we know less about how frailty manifests itself in patients' physiology during critical illness and how it affects resource use in intensive care units (ICU). We aimed to assess the association of frailty with short-term outcomes and organ support used by critically ill patients.Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospective collected data from 93 ICUs in Brazil from 2014 to 2015. We assessed frailty using the modified frailty index (MFI). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were discharge home without need for nursing care, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and utilization of ICU organ support and transfusion. We used mixed logistic regression and competing risk models accounting for relevant confounders in outcome analyses.Results: The analysis consisted of 129,680 eligible patients. There were 40,779 (31.4%) non-frail (MFI = 0), 64,407 (49.7%) pre-frail (MFI = 1-2) and 24,494 (18.9%) frail (MFI ≥ 3) patients. After adjusted analysis, frailty was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.89-3.08), particularly in patients admitted with lower SOFA scores. Frail patients were less likely to be discharged home (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.54-0.79) and had higher hospital and ICU LOS than non-frail patients. Use of all forms of organ support (mechanical ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, dialysis and transfusions) were more common in frail patients and increased as MFI increased.Conclusions: Frailty, as assessed by MFI, was associated with several patient-centered endpoints including not only survival, but also ICU LOS and organ support.

AB  - Background: Although frailty has been linked to higher risk of falls and fracture in the general population, only few studies have examined the extent to which frailty is associated with these outcomes among patients with end-stage renal disease, who are at particularly high risk for these events.Methods: A total of 1,646 patients who were beginning maintenance hemodialysis in 297 dialysis units throughout the United States from September 2005 to June 2007 were enrolled in the Comprehensive Dialysis Study, and 1,053 Medicare beneficiaries were included in this study. Self-reported frailty was defined by the patients endorsing 2 or more of the following: poor physical functioning, exhaustion or low physical activity. Falls and fractures requiring medical attention were identified through Medicare claims data. We examined the association between frailty and the time to first fall or fracture using the Fine-Gray modification of Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for demographics, Quételet's body mass index, diabetes mellitus, heart failure and atherosclerosis.Results: Seventy-seven percent of patients were frail by self-report. The median length of follow-up was 2.5 (1.0-3.9) years. Crude rates of first medically urgent falls or fractures were 66 and 126 per 1,000 person-years in non-frail and self-reported frail participants, respectively. After accounting for demographic factors, comorbidities and the competing risk of death, self-reported frailty was associated with a higher risk of falls or fractures requiring medical attention (hazards ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.16-2.20).Conclusion: Participants reporting frailty experienced nearly twice the risk of medically urgent falls or fractures compared to those who did not report frailty.

AB  - SUMMARY Background Survival for patients commencing renal replacement therapy is around 90% in the first year and 83% at two years after starting dialysis. The factors that appear to predict mortality are comorbidity and frailty associated with kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate, age and biochemical factors. Objectives To analyse the condition of patients starting renal replacement therapy, based on biomarkers commonly used in clinical practice and their association with mortality, measured 6 and 12 months after initiating replacement therapy. Methods A one-year prospective follow-up study with 189 patients. Sociodemographic variables, aetiology of renal disease, comorbidities, prior nephrology service monitoring, prior renal transplantation and biochemical parameters at the time of initiating replacement therapy were analysed. Results The overall percentage of death during the one-year follow-up was 6.87%, with 64% of deaths occurring during the first six months. The only variable independently associated with mortality was low albumin levels. Conclusion Although most patients in this centre are monitored by a nephrologist prior to starting replacement therapy, many nevertheless fail to achieve the biochemical targets recommended. One such parameter is albumin, which proved at the start of replacement therapy to be an independent predictor of mortality. Findings of this study show the need to intervene on certain biochemical parameters during the pre-dialysis stage and at the start of dialysis, in order to improve survival in this group of patients.

AB  - Contemporary Japan is known both for its high tech culture and its rapidly aging population, with 22 % of people currently 65 years and older. Yet there has been little attention to the material culture of the elderly. This paper explores the way aging bodies, official ideology, and consumption of what are called "assistive devices" and "life technologies" come together in the experience of frail old people who depend not only on human caregivers but on "things" such as walkers, kidney dialysis machines, and electric massage chairs. It begins to consider the questions: What technology to aid failing bodies is available, and to whom? How does the advocacy of independence create new forms of consumption? How do "things" mediate ideological change regarding elder care and help to create new understandings of self and one's relation to others? Data come from interviews conducted in 2003-2007 as part of a study of elder care in Japan under the public long term care insurance system that began in 2000. These interviews point both to acceptance of the technology as a way to avoid over-dependence on caregivers, and to resistance to the limitations of aging and to its 21st century definition by the state.

AB  - Introduction: People with chronic kidney disease, who are haemodialysis (HD)-dependent, rely on functioning vascular access to enable effective regular treatment. The native arteriovenous fistula has reduced risk of complication and increased long-term viability; therefore, it is considered the optimal vascular access. Appropriate cannulation technique is vital to maintain fistula viability and reduce risk of access-related complications. Two differing cannulation techniques predominate the HD community worldwide, 'rope laddering' and 'buttonholing'. A third technique, 'area puncturing' is less widely used.The following literature review was undertaken to assess the clinical benefits of buttonhole cannulation for HD. Search strategies: Current literature published that discusses buttonhole cannulation of native arteriovenous fistulas was systematically searched utilising three different electronic databases: Current Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Scopus and Medline via Pubmed. Findings: Five major themes were identified: increased infection rates, reduced pain, decreased aneurysm development, reduced haematoma formation and shortened time to achieve haemostasis post-treatment. Discussion: Buttonhole cannulation may provide several benefits to HD-dependent individuals with a functioning arteriovenous fistula, many of which may be attributed to the use of blunt needles. It requires a different needling technique to rope ladder cannulation. Strict adherence to aseptic technique is vital as clinical benefits ofthe buttonhole technique may be overshadowed by an increase in infective complications. Conclusion: The buttonhole technique potentially may provide benefits for individuals with frail arteriovenous fistulae or limited cannulation area. Careful consideration must be given regarding patient preference, fistula characteristics and the primary cannulator before selecting cannulation technique.

AB  - Background: Frailty increases the risk of disability, long-term care and hospitalisations in the elderly and is recognised as an important challenge to improving healthy ageing. While frailty is known to be associated with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), risk factors underlying these associations remain unclear. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of frailty and investigate lifestyle, social and cardio-metabolic risk factors associated with frailty.Methods: Data come from a socially representative sample of 1622 men from 24 British towns aged 71-92 between 2010 and 2012. Frailty assessment was based on the Fried phenotype comprising weight loss, grip strength, exhaustion, slowness and low physical activity.Results: Among 1622 men, 19% were frail and 54% were pre-frail. Compared to non-frail men, those with frailty had a higher odds of obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2; odds ratio (OR) 2.03, 95%CI 1.38–2.99)), high waist circumference (≥102 cm; OR 2.30, 95%CI 1.67–3.17), and having low social network (OR 2.16; 95%CI 1.46–3.17). Frail individuals also had significantly higher odds of chronic conditions including CVD, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, anaemia, asthma, bronchitis, arthritis, falls, cataract and depression. Frail individuals had a worse cardio-metabolic profile with increased risk of dyslipidemia, increased heart rate, poor lung function (FEV1), raised white cell count, poor renal function (high creatinine, low estimated glomerular filtration rate), low alanine transaminase (ALT), and low serum sodium; some risk factors were also associated with being pre-frail. These associations remained in men without CVD.Conclusions: A range of social and cardiometabolic risk factors were associated with frailty, which highlights the burden of metabolic abnormalities in frail elderly individuals. Characterising and managing the social and metabolic profile is important to manage the high risk of cardiovascular disease in frail elderly individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The age of patients with end-stage renal disease is increasing in Europe and United States. In France, patients older than 75 years represent 40% of the patients who start renal replacement therapy (dialysis or renal transplantation). In these elderly patients with many comorbidities, the benefit of dialysis remains controversial. To provide clear information to patients about diagnosis, prognosis, and all treatment options, more data are needed on their clinical characteristics, therapeutic projects, and outcome. METHODS: Researchers present here the ongoing Parcours de Soins des PersonnesAgées (PSPA) multicenter prospective study, which includes 581 patients with a mean age of 82±5 years and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (by sMDRD) of 14±4ml/min/1.73m(2) without dialysis. RESULTS: Despite a high prevalence of associated comorbidities, most of the patients are autonomous, living at home. Less than 10% are followed jointly by a nephrologist and a geriatrician. At inclusion, postponed dialysis decision due to stable estimated glomerular filtration rate was reported in 43%, 17% of the patients are under evaluation, the decision to start dialysis was chosen in 24% of the patients, nondialysis decision was decided in 16%. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatricians' expertise may help nephrologists to identify patients at high risk of early death for who nondialysis care may be discussed. They also may be more able to evaluate and anticipate the impact of such restricting treatments. A multidisciplinary approach of these old and frail patients' needs to be reinforced.

AB  - Objectives: Physical activity questionnaires usually focus on moderate to vigorous activities and may not accurately capture physical activity or variation in levels of activity among extremely inactive groups like dialysis patients.Design: Cross-sectional study.Setting: Three dialysis facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area.Subjects: Sixty-eight prevalent hemodialysis patients.Intervention: We administered a new physical activity questionnaire designed to capture activity in the lower end of the range, the Low Physical Activity Questionnaire (LoPAQ).Main Outcome Measure: Outcome measures were correlation with a validated physical activity questionnaire, the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity (LTA) questionnaire and with self-reported physical function (physical function score of the SF-36) and physical performance (gait speed, chair stand, balance, and short physical performance battery). We also determined whether patients who were frail or reported limitations in activities of daily living were less active on the LoPAQ.Results: Sixty-eight participants (mean age 59 ± 14 years, 59% men) completed the study. Patients were inactive according to the LoPAQ, with a median (interquartile range) of 517 (204-1190) kcal/week of physical activity. Although activity from the LTA was lower than on the LoPAQ (411 [61-902] kcal/week), the difference was not statistically significant (P = .20), and results from the 2 instruments were strongly correlated (rho = 0.62, P < .001). In addition, higher physical activity measured by the LoPAQ was correlated with better self-reported functioning (rho = 0.64, P < .001), better performance on gait speed (rho = 0.32, P = .02), balance (rho = 0.45, P < .001), and chair rising (rho = -0.32, P = .03) tests and with higher short physical performance battery total score (rho = 0.51, P < .001). Frail patients and patients with activities of daily living limitations were less active than those who were not frail or limited.Conclusions: The LoPAQ performed similarly to the Minnesota LTA questionnaire in our cohort despite being shorter and easier to administer.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease prevalence will continue to rise due to increased life expectancy and population ageing. It is likely that the decline in glomerular filtration rate with increasing age represents a renal manifestation of widespread vascular disease. In addition to its associated cardiovascular risk, chronic kidney disease in older people is associated with increased prevalence of geriatric syndromes such as functional and cognitive decline, which lead to disability and frailty. Competing risks for mortality, because of the co-existence of multiple co-morbidities in old age, means that the majority of older people with chronic kidney disease will not progress to end-stage renal disease. Management of chronic kidney disease in older people is complex and an individualized and holistic, rather than disease-orientated, approach is necessary, which takes into account patients’ priorities and wishes, especially frail and very elderly populations with multiple co-morbidities.

AB  - The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising, particularly among the elderly population. Defining aging as successful or unsuccessful has become clinically relevant in the last 15 years, with an increased recognition of the frail phenotype. Frailty has been shown to be associated with CKD and poorer outcomes, such as death or dialysis. It is likely that the mechanisms of disease in CKD such as altered protein metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and anemia accelerate normal aging and lead to worsening frailty in elderly patients with CKD.

AB  - Aim The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms and the interventions. Methods Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the keywords 'Cognitive and CKD' and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) with the keywords 'Frailty and CKD' were included in final analysis. Results By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population. Conclusions Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Background: The risk of incorrect medication dosing is high in frail older people. Therefore, accurate assessment of the glomerular filtration rate is important. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the estimated glomerular filtration rate using creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, in frail older people. We hypothesized that frailty determines the difference between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae. Methods: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C was determined using (cross-sectional) data of 55 patients (mean age 73 years) admitted to a psychiatric ward for older adults. The level of agreement of these estimations was assessed by a Bland-Altman analysis. In all patients, the Rockwood's Frailty Index was derived and correlated with the mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C. Results: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine (mean 71.2 mL/min/1.73 m) and CKD-EPI cystatin C (mean 57.6 mL/min/1.73 m) was 13.6 mL/min/1.73 m ( p < 0.0001). The two standard deviation limit in the Bland-Altman plot was large (43.2 mL/min/1.73 m), which represents a low level of agreement. The Frailty Index did not correlate with the mean difference between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based glomerular filtration rate (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.182, p = 0.184). Conclusions: There was a significant gap between a creatinine- and cystatin C-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate, irrespective of frailty. The range of differences between the commonly used estimated glomerular filtration rate formulae might result in clinically relevant differences in drug prescription and differences in chronic kidney disease staging.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid conditions.Recent Findings: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally, studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible short-term effects on markers of physical performance.Summary: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered a model of accelerated aging. More specifically, CKD leads to reduced physical functioning and increased frailty, increased vascular dysfunction, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness, high levels of systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence suggests that the cognitive impairment associated with CKD may be related to cerebral small vessel disease and overall impairment in white matter integrity. The triad of poor physical function, vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment places patients living with CKD at an increased risk for loss of independence, poor health-related quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the available evidence of cerebrovascular-renal axis and its interconnection with early and accelerated cognitive impairment in patients with CKD and the plausible role of exercise as a therapeutic modality. Understanding the cerebrovascular-renal axis pathophysiological link and its interconnection with physical function is important for clinicians in order to minimize the risk of loss of independence and improve quality of life in patients with CKD.

AB  - Palliative care is a branch of medicine dedicated to the relief of symptoms experienced during the course of illness. Renal palliative medicine or kidney supportive care is an evolving branch of nephrology, which incorporates the principles of palliative care into the care of CKD and ESRD (dialysis, transplant, and conservatively managed) patients. Conservative (non-dialytic) management is a legitimate option for frail, elderly CKD patients in whom dialysis may not lead to an improvement in quality or duration of life. Patients with advanced CKD have a high symptom burden that often worsens before death. Palliative or supportive care by visiting nurses, palliative care programs, or knowledgeable CKD programs should be routine for conservatively managed CKD patients. Decision-making about dialysis or conservative management requires patients and families be given information on prognosis, quality of life on dialysis, and options for supportive care. Advance care planning is the process by which these issues can be explored. In addition to advance care planning, because patients with ESRD have a high symptom burden, this needs to be addressed. Patients with ESRD have a high symptom burden, which needs to be addressed in any treatment plan. Common symptoms include pain, fatigue, insomnia, pruritus, anorexia, and nausea. Symptoms appear to increase as the patient nears death, and this must be anticipated. Recommendations for management are discussed in the article. Hospice care should be offered to all patients who are expected to die within the next 6 months, and supportive care should be provided to all CKD patients managed conservatively or with dialysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: This qualitative study investigated diabetes care management among family members of American Indian elders with self-care limitations. Focus groups were used to examine the reasons for and content of diabetes care management, the challenges faced, and the support services needed. METHODS: Five focus groups were conducted with family caregivers from six tribes. Caregivers' responses related to care management were identified and categorized into themes. RESULTS: Participants reported that they provided assistance with a wide range of diabetes care tasks (eg, skin and wound care, in-home dialysis) depending on the elder's level of impairment. Caregivers described three major challenges related to diabetes care management. (1) anxiety about in-home care, (2) coping with psychosocial issues, and (3) decision making and communication problems with other family members. They emphasized the importance of developing a care routine for successful diabetes management. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, we suggest areas where diabetes educators can assist American Indian family caregivers in meeting the needs of frail elders in the home.

AB  - Aim: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty, but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited. Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered diabetic nephropathy with end‐stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not (Non‐DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined the risk factors for frailty. Results: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than that in the Non‐DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients (n = 71) and non‐frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty. Conclusions: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 1597–1602.

AB  - Background: Given the volume and cost of inpatient care during the last year of life, there is a critical need to identify patterns of dying as a means of planning end-of-life care services, especially for the growing number of older persons who receive services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Methods: A retrospective computerized record review was conducted of 20,933 VHA patients who died as inpatients between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002. Diagnoses were aggregated into one of five classification patterns of death and analyzed in terms of health care resource utilization (mean number of inpatient days and cumulative outpatient visits in the year preceding the patient's death). Results: Cancer deaths were the most common (30.4%) followed by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (23.2%), cardiopulmonary failure (21.4%), frailty (11.6%), 'other' diagnoses (7.3%), and sudden deaths (6.1%). Those with ESRD were more likely to be male and nonwhite (p < 0.05) and those with frailty were more likely to be older and married (p < 0.05). Controlling for demographic variables, those with frailty had the highest number of inpatient days while those with ESRD had the highest number of outpatient visits. Nonmarried status was associated with more inpatient days, especially among younger decedents. Conclusion: As a recognized leader in end-of-life care, the VHA can play a unique role in the development of specific interventions that address the diverse needs of persons with different dying trajectories identified through this research.

AB  - The current practice of hemodialysis for the frail elderly frequently ignores core bioethical principles. Lack of transparency and shared decision making coupled with financial incentives to treat have resulted in problems of overtreatment near the end of life. Imminent changes in reimbursement for hemodialysis will reverse the financial incentives to favor not treating high-risk patients. In this article, we describe what is empirically known about the approach to hemodialysis today, and how it violates four core ethical principles. We then discuss how the new financial system turns physician and organizational incentives upside down in ways that may exacerbate the ethical dilemmas, but in the opposite direction.

AB  - Background: Hospital use near the end of life is often undesirable to patients, represents considerable Medicare cost, and varies widely across regions.Objective: To concurrently examine regional and patient factors, including disability and functional decline, associated with end-of-life hospital use.Design/participants: We sampled decedents aged 65 and older (n = 2,493) from the Health and Retirement Study (2000-2006), and linked data from individual Medicare claims and the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. Two-part regression models estimated the relationship between total hospital days in the last 6 months and patient characteristics including physical function, while adjusting for regional resources and hospital care intensity (HCI).Key Results: Median hospital days was 7 (range = 0-183). 53% of respondents had functional decline. Compared with decedents without functional decline, those with severe disability or decline had more regression-adjusted hospital days (range 3.47-9.05, depending on category). Dementia was associated with fewer days (-3.02); while chronic kidney disease (2.37), diabetes (2.40), stroke or transient ischemic attack (2.11), and congestive heart failure (1.74) were associated with more days. African Americans and Hispanics had more days (5.91 and 4.61, respectively). Those with family nearby had 1.62 fewer days and hospice enrollees had 1.88 fewer days. Additional hospital days were associated with urban residence (1.74) and residence in a region with more specialists (1.97) and higher HCI (2.27).Conclusions: Functional decline is significantly associated with end-of-life hospital use among older adults. To improve care and reduce costs, health care programs and policies should address specific needs of patients with functional decline and disability.

AB  - As people live longer, chronic illness care will consume an ever-larger part of a nation's financial resources. With the 'baby-boomer' generation reaching retirement age beginning in 2011, there will be an increased demand for chronic services/care in the population aged 65 years and older. Innovative approaches to quality care must be sought, while understanding the financial costs associated with the delivery of such care to the geriatric population. Elderly persons utilize more physical resources and it is important to identify early those beneficiaries who would benefit medically from intervention. Disease management is built on a model of integrated care, with each member of the healthcare team working together toward a common set of objectives. The ultimate goal is to keep the patient functioning well in an outpatient setting, thus avoiding the high debility and costs associated with hospitalization and institutionalization. Creating such a system requires a substantial investment in infrastructure. The concept of 'spending $5.00 to save $10.00' must be incorporated into the planning process. In chronically ill seniors there is a need for care as well as cure, which involves improving function and quality of life (QOL) for the frail elders by paying attention to the psychological and socioeconomic status in addition to the physical condition. Small gains in function can mean large gains in patients' QOL. Reducing the progression of functional decline among the physically frail who live at home is a goal. Home visits are a critical component of the total care delivered. Changing physician behavior to accept the tenets of disease management requires education in advance of launching such a program. There must be healthcare team buy-in for a program to achieve success. Personnel requirements include senior nurses, social workers, physical therapists and nutritionists, supported by a sophisticated information technology system. Components of an information technology system must allow for adequate data collection and subsequent generation of reports. Continuous quality improvement will occur only if such a system is in place. While the average chronologic age of the patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is almost 62 years, the physiologic age is much older. Therefore, ESRD serves as a model for chronic illness that affects a geriatric population and the benefits achieved by a disease management approach to this chronic disease are noted. Disease management improved glycemic control in the ESRD patient with diabetes mellitus by establishing a protocol for frequency of measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c). For this population at risk, a decreased hospitalization rate for diabetic complications resulted from this initiative. Also, a vascular access initiative in the described ESRD disease management program resulted in an increase in the creation of arterio-venous fistulas and a decrease in the placement of tunneled-cuff catheters. Fistula creation was associated with less infections and access thrombosis compared with catheter use for access. QOL improved for these patients with ESRD because of decreased hospitalization rate for access-related issues. Significant cost savings were achieved because of fewer hospital admissions and a decrease in the number of bed days per year. The lessons learned from the ESRD model can help in developing future disease management programs for the geriatric population.

AB  - Background: For chronic hemodialysis, the ideal permanent vascular access is the arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Temporary catheters should be reserved for acute dialysis needs. The AVF is associated with lower infection rates, better clinical results, and a higher quality of life and survival when compared to temporary catheters. In Brazil, the proportion of patients with temporary catheters for more than 3 months from the beginning of therapy is used as an evaluation of the quality of renal units. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated with the time between the beginning of hemodialysis with temporary catheters and the placement of the first arteriovenous fistula in Brazil.Methods: This is an observational, prospective non-concurrent study using national administrative registries of all patients financed by the public health system who began renal replacement therapy (RRT) between 2000 and 2004 in Brazil. Incident patients were eligible who had hemodialysis for the first time. Patients were excluded who: had hemodialysis reportedly started after the date of death (inconsistent database); were younger than 18 years old; had HIV; had no record of the first dialysis unit; and were dialyzed in units with less than twenty patients. To evaluate individual and renal unit factors associated with the event of interest, the frailty model was used (N = 55,589).Results: Among the 23,824 patients (42.9%) who underwent fistula placement in the period of the study, 18.2% maintained the temporary catheter for more than three months until the fistula creation. The analysis identified five statistically significant factors associated with longer time until first fistula: higher age (Hazard-risk - HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00); having hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.98) as the cause of chronic renal disease; residing in capitals cities (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95) and certain regions in Brazil - South (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.8-0.87), Midwest (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94), Northeast (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94), or North (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94) and the type of renal unit (public or private).Conclusion: Monitoring the provision of arteriovenous fistulas in renal units could improve the care given to patients with end stage renal disease.

AB  - Objectives To compare rates and risk factors for early hospital readmission for nursing home residents and community-dwelling older adults. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Geriatric inpatient service at a large urban hospital. Participants Nursing home residents (n = 625) and community-dwelling individuals (n = 413) aged 65 and older admitted over a 1-year period. Measurements Thirty-day readmissions. Results There were 1,706 hospital admissions within the 1-year study period involving 1,038 individuals. The 30-day readmission rate was higher for subjects discharged to a nursing home than those discharged to the community (34.4% vs 22.6%, P < .001). Chronic kidney disease and pressure ulcers were associated with greater risk of readmission in both groups. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was a risk factor for readmission only in community-dwelling individuals. Congestive heart failure and dementia were associated with greater risk of readmission only in nursing home residents. Readmission rates varied between individual nursing homes by more than a factor of 2. Risk of readmission was 30% lower in nursing home residents cared for by hospitalist than nonhospitalist geriatricians. Conclusion Higher rates of hospital readmission for individuals discharged to nursing homes than to the community and differing patterns of risk factors for readmission indicate the importance of customized interventions to reduce readmission rates for two distinct elderly populations.

AB  - The number of patients with end-stage kidney disease 65 years and older is growing, and this growth is expected to continue. The presence of medical comorbidities, limited life expectancy, frailty, and poor functional status in these patients poses substantial challenges in clinical decision-making and provision of optimal care. Frailty is more common in elderly patients with CKD than without and is associated with poor outcomes. Several prognostic tools were developed to estimate the rate of CKD progression among elderly, and risk of mortality after dialysis initiation. Risk factors for CKD progression among elderly include low estimated glomerular filtration rate, high baseline proteinuria, acute kidney injury, low serum albumin, and presence of congestive heart failure. The decision to initiate dialysis in the elderly should take into consideration life expectancy, risks and benefits of each dialysis modality, quality of life, and patient and caregiver preferences. This article discusses common issues in the elderly with end-stage kidney disease, with particular emphasis on the impact of frailty and functional status, choice of dialysis modality and vascular access, and prognosis after dialysis initiation, to assist the nephrologist in making decisions regarding optimal care for this complex group of patients.

AB  - Background: The Fried frailty phenotype, a measure of physiologic reserve defined by 5 components (exhaustion, unintentional weight loss, low physical activity, slow walking speed, and poor grip strength), is associated with poor outcomes among ESRD patients. However, these 5 components may not fully capture physiologic reserve in this population. We aimed to ascertain opinions of ESRD clinicians and patients about the usefulness of the Fried frailty phenotype and interventions to improve frailty in ESRD patients, and to identify novel components to further characterize frailty in ESRD.Methods: Clinicians who treat adults with ESRD completed a 2-round Delphi study (n = 41 and n = 36, respectively; response rate = 87%). ESRD patients completed a survey at transplant evaluation (n = 460; response rate = 81%). We compared clinician and patient opinions on the constituent components of frailty.Results: Clinicians were more likely than patients to say that ESRD makes patients frail (97.6% vs. 60.2%). There was consensus among clinicians that exhaustion, low physical activity, slow walking speed, and poor grip strength characterize frailty in ESRD patients; however, 29% of clinicians thought weight loss was not relevant. Patients were less likely than clinicians to say that the 5 Fried frailty components were relevant. Clinicians identified 10 new ESRD-specific potential components including falls (64%), physical decline (61%), and cognitive impairment (39%). Clinicians (83%) and patients (80%) agreed that intradialytic foot-peddlers might make ESRD patients less frail.Conclusions: There was consensus among clinicians and moderate consensus among patients that frailty is more common in ESRD. Weight loss was not seen as relevant, but new components were identified. These findings are first steps in refining the frailty phenotype and identifying interventions to improve physiologic reserve specific to ESRD patients.

AB  - The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation, Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease (CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent 'disease' and using age-specific cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis) and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the oldest old with CKD.

AB  - Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition) due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition, comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW.

AB  - The dialysis community has increasingly shown the health benefits of short daily hemodialysis (sDHD) at home. While this appears mainly suitable for younger and more independent patients, it seems likely that older and frailer patients would benefit from short daily dialysis as well. Humber River Regional Hospital has an in-center daily dialysis program in Canada, offering services to 31 patients. The experiences of patients, challenges for the health care team, and funding issues are discussed and point toward a promising future for in-center daily dialysis. However, a need for studies of greater quality and quantity is outlined as a major obstacle in gaining widespread support for in-center daily dialysis from the funders of dialysis care.

AB  - Aim To present the rationale, design and methodology of the GERAS project, which examines whether assessment of frailty and mild cognitive impairment could enhance risk prediction for biomedical, psychosocial outcomes and foster efficient resource allocation in kidney transplantation. Background For the burgeoning cohort of older patients considered for kidney transplantation, evidence gaps regarding frailty and mild cognitive impairment limit clinical decision-making and medical management. As known risk factors for 'hard' clinical outcomes in chronic illness, both require further study in transplantation. Integrating these and other bio-psychosocial factors into a comprehensive pre-transplant patient assessment will provide insights regarding economic implications and may improve risk prediction. Design A nation-wide multi-centre prospective cohort study nested in the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study. Methods Our nationally representative convenience sample includes 250 adult kidney transplant recipients. Data sources include the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study and primary data collected at time of transplantation, 6 months, 1 and 2 years post-transplant via established measures (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Psychosocial Questionnaire, Fried Frailty Instrument and a blood analysis), investigator-developed instruments and datasets compiled by hospitals' management control units, sickness funds, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and the European Renal Association. Descriptive, competing risk survival and mixed effects analyses will be performed. Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained in January 2016. Discussion This pioneering project jointly examines frailty and mild cognitive impairment from bio-psychosocial and health economic perspectives. Results may significantly inform risk prediction, care tailoring and resource optimization to improve health outcomes in the ageing kidney transplant cohort.

AB  - Aim To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index ( FI). Methods One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total number of deficits considered, to derive an FI- CKD. Results One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI- CKD was 0.25 ( SD 0.12). The FI- CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P = 0.04). Conclusions The FI- CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

The aim of the study is to define a pattern of frailty among our dialysis population, to analyse the incidence and clinical evolution of these patients. Materials and Methods. We analysed a total of 320 patients with stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) who were on hemodialysis between September 2014 and September 2015. To define a patient as frail we used the Fried phenotype model, and we added a new criteria-dialysis session length longer than 12 hours/week. Results. 5.6% of the 320 patients were frail. We found statistically significant differences regarding body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin (Hgb), and serum albumin, as well as the ability to perform the basic activities of daily living (p<0.005), ability to ambulate (p=0.01) and perform transfers (p<0.005). We found statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of hospital admissions (p=0.005) and mortality (p<0.005). Conclusion. 5.6% of the study population were frail, with lower BMI, serum albumin and hemoglobin, lower capacity for basic activities of daily living, ambulation, and transference, as well as higher morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Background: Frailty is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. However, apart from its influence on cognition, it is currently unknown whether frailty affects subtler cerebral function in patients with ESRD.Methods: Patients with ESRD were prospectively enrolled, with clinical features and laboratory data recorded. The severity of frailty among these patients with ESRD was ascertained using the previously validated simple FRAIL scale, and was categorized as none-to-mild and moderate-to-severe frailty. All participants underwent quantitative electroencephalography (EEG), with band powers documented following the generation of the delta to alpha ratio (DAR) and delta/theta to alpha/beta ratio (DTABR). EEG results were then compared between groups of different levels of frailty.Results: In this cohort, (mean age: 68.9 ± 10.4 years, 37% male, 3.4 ± 3 years of dialysis), 20, 60, 40, 17, and 6% patients exhibited positivity in the fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss-of-body-weight domains, respectively, with 45.7% being none to mildly frail and 54.3% being moderately to severely frail. Those with mild frailty had a significantly higher delta power compared to those with more severe frailty, involving all topographic sites. Patients with ESRD and severe frailty had significantly lower global, left frontal, left temporo-occipital, and right temporo-occipital DAR and DTABR, except in the right frontal area, and tended to have central accentuation of alpha, beta, and theta power, and more homogeneous DTABR and DAR distribution compared to the findings in those with mild frailty.Conclusions: Frailty in patients with ESRD can have subtler neurophysiological influences, presenting as altered EEG findings, which warrant our attention.

AB  - Background: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic kidney disease.Methods: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.Results: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.Conclusion: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection remain elusive.

AB  - Frailty is a physiologic state of increased vulnerability to stressors that results from decreased physiologic reserves or dysregulation of multiple physiologic systems. The construct of frailty has been operationalized as a composite of poor physical function, exhaustion, low physical activity, and weight loss. Several studies have now examined the prevalence of frailty among chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and have found frailty to be more common among individuals with CKD than among those without. Furthermore, frailty is associated with adverse outcomes among incident dialysis patients, including higher risk of hospitalization and death. Recent evidence shows that frail patients are started on dialysis earlier (at a higher estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) on average than nonfrail patients, but it remains unclear whether these patients' frailty is a result of uremia or is independent of CKD. The survival disadvantage that has been associated with early initiation of dialysis in observational studies could be mediated in part through confounding on the basis of unmeasured frailty. However, available data do not suggest improvement in frailty upon initiation of dialysis; rather, the trajectory appears to be toward higher levels of dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs) after dialysis initiation. Overall, there are no data to suggest that frail patients derive any benefit from early initiation of dialysis either in the form of improved survival or functional status.

AB  - Objective: Frailty among the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population is highly prevalent and has been associated with mortality. Little is known about the relation of different aspects of body composition, a modifiable risk factor, with the risk of frailty in ESRD population.Design and Methods: One hundred and fifty-one patients including 85 men and 66 women, aged ≥18 years with ESRD who had been receiving conventional maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for at least 3 months were included. Body fat and muscle mass from both bioimpedance spectroscopy and skin-fold thickness and waist circumference as a surrogate of abdominal obesity were measured. Frailty was defined based on Fried's criteria. Health-related quality of life was collected using the RAND version of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36) Survey.Results: We performed single and multiple predictor logistic regression analyses to determine factors associated with frailty. After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities, fat mass (both by bioimpedance spectroscopy and anthropometry) and waist circumference, but not muscle mass remained the main predictors of frailty. The odds ratio of frailty in the third tertile compared with the first was 4.97 (1.70-14.55) and 3.84 (1.39-10.61) for fat mass and waist circumference, respectively (P for trends for both <.05). The scores of physical health and kidney disease effect component of quality of life were lower in frail compared with nonfrail patients (40.7 ± 9.2 vs. 33.7 ± 10.2, P < .01 and 66.8 ± 22.4 vs. 51.6 ± 25.7, P < .05 for physical health and effects of disease, respectively).Conclusions: Frailty, which is associated with poor outcomes in chronic HD patients, is common and predicted by fat mass and waist circumference but not by body mass index and muscle mass. Interventions to modify abdominal obesity, reflected by waist circumference, could potentially lower the incidence of frailty and hence improve the quality of life in the HD population.

AB  - Objective: to assess the frail level of the elderly with chronic kidney disease under conservative treatment. Methods: this is a cross-sectional and correlational study performed with 35 elderly. The frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frail Scale instrument. A descriptive analysis and Spearman correlation coefficients were performed. Results: the frailty showed a minimal variation of 1 and maximum of 14, with a mean score 7.71 (±3.10). Women (8.05±3.551) and illiterates (9.57±2.637) showed a higher mean score of frail. By correlating the frail score, a moderate inverse correlation was found with years of study (p=0.033) and moderate positive correlation with some complications (p<0.05). Conclusion: the elderly with chronic kidney disease under conservative treatment showed some frailty degree, the highest levels were correlated with lower education and a higher number of clinical complications

AB  - Background: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis and is traditionally measured using tools that assess physical impairment. Alternate measurement tools highlight cognitive and functional domains, requiring clinician, patient, and/or caregiver input. In this study, we compared frailty measures for incident dialysis patients that incorporate patient, clinician, and caregiver perspectives with an aim to contrast the measured prevalence of frailty using tools derived from different conceptual frameworks.Methods: A prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients was conducted between February 2014 and June 2015. Frailty was assessed at dialysis onset using: 1) modified definition of Fried Phenotype (Dialysis Morbidity Mortality Study definition, DMMS); 2) Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS); 3) Frailty Assessment Care Planning Tool (provides CFS grading, FACT-CFS); and 4) Frailty Index (FI). Measures were compared via correlation and sensitivity/specificity analyses.Results: A total of 98 patients participated (mean age of 61 ± 14 years). Participants were primarily Caucasian (91%), male (58%), and the majority started on hemodialysis (83%). The median score for both the CFS and FACT-CFS was 4 (interquartile range of 3-5). The mean FI score was 0.31 (standard deviation ± 0.16). The DMMS identified 78% of patients as frail. The FACT-CFS demonstrated highest correlation (r = 0.71) with the FI, while the DMMS was most sensitive (97%, 100%) and a CFS ≥ 5 most specific (100%, 77%) at corresponding FI cutoff values (>0.21, >0.45).Conclusions: Frailty assessments of incident dialysis patients that include clinician, caregiver and patient perspectives have moderate to strong correlation with the FI. At specified FI cutoff values, the FACT-CFS and DMMS are highly sensitive measures of frailty. The CFS and FACT-CFS may represent viable alternative screening tools in dialysis patients.

AB  - Background- For the large and growing population of elderly patients with cardiovascular disease, it is important to identify clinically relevant measures of biological age and their contribution to risk. Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine denoting increased vulnerability and decreased physiological reserves. We analyzed the manner in which the variable frailty predicts short-term outcomes for elderly non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients. Methods and Results- Patients aged >=75 years, with diagnosed non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were included at 3 centers, and clinical data including judgment of frailty were collected prospectively. Frailty was defined according to the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Scale. The impact of the comorbid conditions on risk was quantified by the coronary artery disease-specific index. Of 307 patients, 149 (48.5%) were considered frail. By multiple logistic regression, frailty was found to be strongly and independently associated with risk for the primary composite outcome (death from any cause, myocardial reinfarction, revascularization due to ischemia, hospitalization for any cause, major bleeding, stroke/transient ischemic attack, and need for dialysis up to 1 month after inclusion) (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.7), in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-16.8), and 1-month mortality (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-13.0). Conclusions- Frailty is strongly and independently associated with in-hospital mortality, 1-month mortality, prolonged hospital care, and the primary composite outcome. The combined use of frailty and comorbidity may constitute an ultimate risk prediction concept in regard to cardiovascular patients with complex needs.

AB  - Background: Increasing the weekly frequency of hemodialysis sessions has positive effects, on the control of several biological data of patients. However, knowledge about Daily HemoDialysis (DHD) practices is limited in France. The aim of the present study was to describe the characteristics and treatment trajectories of all French patients undergoing DHD.Methods: All patients older than 18 years who started DHD between 2003 and 2012 in France were included and followed until December 31, 2013. The patients' demographic and clinical characteristics and treatment modalities were extracted from the French Renal Epidemiological and Information Network (REIN) registry.Results: During the inclusion period, 753 patients started DHD in France. Based on their median age (64 years), patients were classified in two groups: "old" group (≥64 years) and "young" group (<64 years). Patients in the old group had more comorbidities than in the young group: 48 % had diabetes (vs 29 % in the young group), 17 % an active malignancy (vs 10 %) and 80 % ≥1 cardiovascular disease (vs 41 %). Concerning patients' treatment trajectories, 496 (66 %) patients started with another dialysis before switching to DHD and 257 (34 %) directly with DHD. At the end of the follow-up, 69 % of patients in the old group were dead (27.4 % in the young group) and kidney transplantation was more frequent in the young group (30.4 % vs 0.5 %).Conclusion: In France, DHD is proposed not only to young in rather good clinical conditions and waiting for kidney transplantation, but also to old and frail patients with higher mortality.

AB  - Elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or who are on dialysis should be able to live as fully and comfortably as possible. Geriatric patients are most interested in outcomes that will optimize mental and physical function and limit suffering and pain. Nephrologists must help them answer the question: 'How will my kidney problem affect the way I live now and in the future?' This means management must move beyond glomerular filtration rate-related targets and incorporate geriatric principles that focus on assessment of function, comorbidities, geriatric syndromes, and quality of life issues. Therapeutic decisions should be individualized and directed by patient goals of care, which must be explored and documented. Accomplishing this requires inclusion of the patient's family-support system in the shared decision-making process. There is no substitute for spending time listening to and understanding the patient and family agenda, providing timely medical and prognostic updates; discussing realistic scenarios to balance expectations; and planting the seeds of change as the quantity and quality of medical events, geriatric syndromes, and comorbidities accumulate. Synergy of the interdisciplinary renal team with geriatric and palliative medicine specialists provides the expertise to achieve these goals. This falls into the domain of geriatric renal palliative or supportive care (1) and is the subject of this practical review.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Patients reaching end-stage kidney disease face difficult decisions, including choosing among renal replacement therapies (RRTs). With an increasingly elderly and frail population, there is growing interest in conservative kidney management (CKM) as a viable alternative to dialysis. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a patient-centered approach to these decisions, in which choices are viewed within the explicitly discussed values and preferences of the patient. Patient decision aids (PDAs) are tools designed to facilitate these discussions. The choice between dialysis and CKM is particularly complex, given the poor prognostication data for CKM. This is an emerging area for PDAs in nephrology. This review highlights care gaps around SDM for dialysis versus CKM, presents current PDAs for making choices about RRTs and CKM and discusses exciting new work around the development of novel PDAs.Recent Findings: Many PDAs have been created recently, primarily to help with decisions about RRTs. Three new PDAs are in testing phases to aid with the more complex decision of choosing between dialysis and CKM.Summary: International nephrology communities are moving toward improved SDM with their patients and PDAs are being developed to facilitate this process.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.Recent Findings: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD. Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.Summary: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL outcomes remains to be determined.

AB  - Hypertension in a nursing home patient is a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher and 130 mm Hg or higher in a patient with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency, or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher and 80 mm Hg or higher in a patient with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency. Numerous prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that antihypertensive drug therapy reduces the development of new coronary events, stroke, and congestive heart failure in older persons. The goal of treatment of hypertension in elderly persons is to lower the blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg and to less than 130/80 mm Hg in older persons with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency. Elderly persons with diastolic hypertension should have their diastolic blood pressure reduced to 80 to 85 mm Hg. Diuretics should be used as initial drugs in the treatment of older persons with hypertension and no associated medical conditions. The selection of antihypertensive drug therapy in persons with associated medical conditions depends on their associated medical conditions. If the blood pressure is more than 20/10 mm Hg above the goal blood pressure, drug therapy should be initiated with 2 antihypertensive drugs, one of which should be a thiazide-type diuretic. Other coronary risk factors must be treated in patients with hypertension.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate hypertension (HTN) management in patients 80 years of age and older who reside in a large, long-term care (LTC) facility. Data source A retrospective chart audit was conducted on 75 charts of patients 80 years of age and older and who had a diagnosis of HTN. Using the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) Expert Consensus Document on Management of Hypertension in the Elderly as a guide, blood pressure readings, significant comorbidities, and antihypertensive medication utilization were analyzed. Conclusions LTC residents in this sample were often not treated according to expert recommendations. Specifically, analysis revealed overtreatment of uncomplicated HTN and undertreatment of those with comorbid conditions. Additionally, those with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease were infrequently prescribed ace inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, as recommended. Implications for practice Utilizing evidence-based practice (EBP) guidelines affords the best avenue for providing safe and effective treatment of HTN. While expert recommendations are available, researchers seldom recruit frail elders in LTC facilities into treatment investigations. In the absence of population-specific EBP guidelines, nurse practitioners must rely on expert opinion and diagnostic reasoning to individualize HTN treatment to this unique and vulnerable population.

AB  - Objective: to outline the epidemiological and socioeconomic profile of older people on hemodialysis. Methodology: a quantitative, descriptive, cross study, held in dialysis clinics with 80 elderly people of both sexes. Results: with regard to the duration of hemodialysis, the mean was 3.03 years of treatment, the majority of patients have a minimum wage income, 70.2 % of men are married and 48.5 % of women are widows, 81, 3 % did not complete grammar school. As far as epidemiological data are concerned: 52.5 % had systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 25 %, 41.3 % had a co-morbidity, being hypertension and heart disease the most frequent; 23.1 % and 11, 5 % respectively. Discussion: the elderly´s condition is worsened by social deprivation and the need for preventive measures to control hypertension and diabetes, in order to avoid possible additional suffering to poverty, which is a predisposing factor for unhealthy aging. Conclusion: in the Brazilian context preventive actions that promote healthy aging are still not sufficiently performed by health professionals, although these actions are legally covered by public policy.
AB  - Objetivos: trazar el perfil socioeconómico y epidemiológico de ancianos en hemodiálisis. Metodología: estudio cuantitativo, descriptivo, transversal, realizado en clínicas de hemodiálisis con 80 ancianos de ambos sexos. Resultados: en cuanto al tiempo de hemodiálisis, el promedio fue de 3,03 años de tratamiento; en la mayoría la renta familiar fue de un salario mínimo; 70,2 % de los hombres son casados y 48,5 % de las mujeres son viudas; 81,3 % no completaron la enseñanza fundamental. En cuanto a los datos epidemiológicos: 52,5 % tuvieron como enfermedad de base la hipertensión arterial sistémica, 25 % Diabetes mellitus, 41,3 % presentaron una comorbidad, entre las principales están: hipertensión arterial 23,1 % y enfermedad cardiaca 11,5 %. Discusión: en los ancianos los agravantes de su patología son las limitaciones sociales y la necesidad de medidas de prevención para el control de la hipertensión y diabetes, para evitar sufrimientos adicionales a la condición de pobreza, un factor que predispone el envejecimiento no saludable. Conclusiones: en la realidad brasileña las acciones de prevención que favorezcan el envejecimiento saludable aún no son suficientemente realizadas por los profesionales de la salud, aunque están apoyadas en la legislación de las políticas públicas.

AB  - Background In Australia, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing steadily, especially amongst older people. The extent to which dialysis prolongs life and its effect on quality of life (QoL) of elderly patients who are frail or disabled also remains unclear. Patients and methods We conducted a single-centre, prospective study to compare the trajectory of symptom burden and functional status in elderly patients (age >65 years) with stage 5 CKD receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT), n=12, versus those managed conservatively without dialysis, n=8. Dialysis patients were younger (mean age 73(7) versus 84(6) years, p=0.001). Groups were similar at baseline in functional status, nutrition, co-morbidity and frailty assessments. All patients were still alive after six months. Results Dialysis patients reported a greater improvement in overall symptom scores by six months and no dialysis patient reported severe or overwhelming symptoms while one (13%) conservatively managed patient reported severe pruritus. There was no change in functional status in both groups over a six-month follow-up period. Conclusion We have contributed unique prospective longitudinal data showing the symptom and functional trajectory of a small group of elderly patients with CKD who have just been commenced on dialysis or referred to the renal supportive care clinic.

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.Methods: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.Results: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower physical and mental quality of life.Conclusions: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of life.

AB  - Patients with ESRD have extensive and unique end-of-life care considerations and needs. Despite substantial advancements in renal palliative care over the past decade, much research is still required. Identifying CKD patients whose illness trajectory has shifted and would likely benefit from a palliative approach to care should be a priority of all nephrology programs. Further research on symptom management, the effectiveness of ACP, the life expectancy of conservatively managed and incident dialysis patients, anticipated changes in functional status and HRQL with the initiation of dialysis (especially among the frail elderly), and the best way to deliver renal palliative care is required to maximize the integration and effectiveness of renal palliative care services.

AB  - Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

AB  - CONTEXT: There are few data on the frequency and current management of clinical ethical issues related to care of seriously ill dialysis patients in free-standing dialysis facilities. OBJECTIVES: To examine the extent of clinical ethical challenges experienced by care providers in free-standing facilities and their perceptions about how those issues are managed. METHODS: A total of 183 care providers recruited from 15 facilities in North Carolina completed a survey regarding the occurrence and management of ethical issues in the past year. Care plan meetings were observed at four of the facilities for three consecutive months. Also, current policies and procedures at each of the facilities were reviewed. RESULTS: The two most frequently experienced challenges involved dialyzing frail patients with multiple comorbidities and caring for disruptive/difficult patients. The most common ways of managing ethical issues were discussions in care plan meetings (n = 47) or discussions with the clinic manager (n = 47). Although policies were in place to guide management of some of the challenges, respondents were often not aware of those policies. Also, although participants reported that ethical issues related to dialyzing undocumented immigrants were fairly common, no facility had a policy for managing this challenge. Participants suggested that all staff obtain training in clinical ethics and communication skills, facilities develop ethics teams, and there be clear policies to guide management of ethical challenges. CONCLUSION: The scope of ethical challenges was extensive, how these challenges were managed varied widely, and there were limited resources for assistance. Multifaceted efforts, encompassing endeavors at the individual, facility, organization, and national levels, are needed to support staff in improving the management of ethical challenges in dialysis facilities.

AB  - Anemia is extremely common following hip fracture. Consistent data from randomized trials show that transfusion of less blood, with a transfusion threshold around 8 g/dL hemoglobin concentration, is preferable to a traditional threshold of 10 g/dL. Adoption of a lower threshold leads to at least equivalent clinical outcomes, with much less exposure to transfusion costs and risks. The most common complication of transfusion is circulatory overload. Future research may elucidate the optimal transfusion threshold for these elderly patients and address the specific needs of subgroups of patients, including those with acute coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease.

AB  - Purpose: Although a population's senescence rate is classically measured as the increase in mortality rate with age on a logarithmic scale, it may be more accurately measured as the increase on a linear scale. Patients on dialysis, who suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality rate on a logarithmic scale, but a larger increase on a linear scale than patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be biased by population heterogeneity.Methods: Follow-up data on 323,308 patients on dialysis and 91,679 patients with a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models that allow individual variation in this increase.Results: According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase in mortality rate on a logarithmic scale was smaller in patients on dialysis, while the senescence rate measured as the increase on a linear scale was larger in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant.Conclusions: Also when accounting for population heterogeneity, a population's senescence rate is more accurately measured as the increase in mortality rate on a linear scale than a logarithmic scale.

AB  - This is a case study of two elderly, frail women in New York City who were recently rendered homeless. One woman had a massive tumor on her occipital scalp; the other was in renal failure. The obstacles and complexities of providing care to those with double jeopardy--being elderly and homeless--are described. There are enormous difficulties for placement into safe, supportive housing once people become homeless. The process is expensive and labor intensive. This can be complicated by the existence of mental illness. A New York agency that works with mentally ill homeless people is described. There are systemic obstacles as well: One woman loses her Medicaid when she moves from one state to another to be closer to her family. Another, 82 years old, is told to get a job so that she could qualify for Medicare. There are numerous contradictions and unnecessary costs in a fragmented health care system to which the obvious solution is a national single-payer system of care.

AB  - In this consensus paper, the Belgian Bone Club aims to provide a state of the art on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of osteoporosis in frail individuals, including patients with anorexia nervosa, patients on dialysis, cancer patients, persons with sarcopenia, and the oldest old. All these conditions may indeed induce bone loss that is superimposed on physiological bone loss and often remains under-recognized and under-treated. This is of particular concern because of the major burden of osteoporotic fractures in terms of morbidity, mortality, and economic cost. Therefore, there is an urgent need to appreciate bone loss associated with these conditions, as this may improve diagnosis and management of bone loss and fracture risk in clinical practice.

AB  - Peritoneal dialysis is troubled with declining utilisation as a form of renal replacement therapy in developed countries. We review key aspects of therapy evidenced to have a potential to increase its utilisation. The best evidence to repopulate PD programmes is provided for the positive impact of timely referral and systematic and motivational predialysis education: average odds ratio for instituting peritoneal dialysis versus haemodialysis was 2.6 across several retrospective studies on the impact of predialysis education. Utilisation of PD for unplanned acute dialysis starts facilitated by implantation of peritoneal catheters by interventional nephrologists may diminish the vast predominance of haemodialysis done by central venous catheters for unplanned dialysis start. Assisted peritoneal dialysis can improve accessibility of home based dialysis to elderly, frail, and dependant patients, whose quality of life on replacement therapy may benefit most from dialysis performed at home. Peritoneal dialysis providers should perform close monitoring, preventing measures, and timely prophylactic therapy in patients judged to be prone to EPS development. Each peritoneal dialysis programme should regularly monitor, report, and act on key quality indicators to manifest its ability of constant quality improvement and elevate the confidence of interested patients and financing bodies in the programme.

AB  - Background: The number of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease opting for conservative management rather than dialysis is unknown but likely to be growing as increasingly frail patients with advanced renal disease present to renal services. Conservative kidney management includes ongoing medical input and support from a multidisciplinary team. There is limited evidence concerning patient and carer experience of this choice. This study will explore quality of life, symptoms, cognition, frailty, performance decision making, costs and impact on carers in people with advanced chronic kidney disease managed without dialysis and is funded by the National Institute of Health Research in the UK.Methods: In this prospective, multicentre, longitudinal study, patients will be recruited in the UK, by renal research nurses, once they have made the decision not to embark on dialysis. Carers will be asked to 'opt-in' with consent from patients. The approach includes longitudinal quantitative surveys of quality of life, symptoms, decision making and costs for patients and quality of life and costs for carers, with questionnaires administered quarterly over 12 months. Additionally, the decision making process will be explored via qualitative interviews with renal physicians/clinical nurse specialists.Discussion: The study is designed to capture patient and carer profiles when conservative kidney management is implemented, and understand trajectories of care-receiving and care-giving with the aim of optimising palliative care for this population. It will explore the interactions that lead to clinical care decisions and the impact of these decisions on informal carers with the intention of improving clinical outcomes for patients and the experiences of care givers.

AB  - Background: Frailty, a validated measure of physiologic reserve, predicts adverse health outcomes among adults with end-stage renal disease. Frailty typically is not measured clinically; instead, a surrogate-perceived frailty-is used to inform clinical decision-making. Because correlations between perceived and measured frailty remain unknown, the aim of this study was to assess their relationship.Methods: 146 adults undergoing hemodialysis were recruited from a single dialysis center in Baltimore, Maryland. Patient characteristics associated with perceived (reported by nephrologists, nurse practitioners (NPs), or patients) or measured frailty (using the Fried criteria) were identified using ordered logistic regression. The relationship between perceived and measured frailty was assessed using percent agreement, kappa statistic, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and prevalence of misclassification of frailty. Patient characteristics associated with misclassification were determined using Fisher's exact tests, t-tests, or median tests.Results: Older age (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.36, 95%CI:1.11-1.68, P = 0.003 per 5-years older) and comorbidity (aOR = 1.49, 95%CI:1.27-1.75, P < 0.001 per additional comorbidity) were associated with greater likelihood of nephrologist-perceived frailty. Being non-African American was associated with greater likelihood of NP- (aOR = 5.51, 95%CI:3.21-9.48, P = 0.003) and patient- (aOR = 4.20, 95%CI:1.61-10.9, P = 0.003) perceived frailty. Percent agreement between perceived and measured frailty was poor (nephrologist, NP, and patient: 64.1%, 67.0%, and 55.5%). Among non-frail participants, 34.4%, 30.0%, and 31.6% were perceived as frail by a nephrologist, NP, or themselves. Older adults (P < 0.001) were more likely to be misclassified as frail by a nephrologist; women (P = 0.04) and non-African Americans (P = 0.02) were more likely to be misclassified by an NP. Neither age, sex, nor race was associated with patient misclassification.Conclusions: Perceived frailty is an inadequate proxy for measured frailty among patients undergoing hemodialysis.

AB  - Background: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney failure.Methods: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults with end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South America designed to examine the association between periodontitis and all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis. Participants were matched 1:1 on their propensity score for moderate to severe periodontitis assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries.Results: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score methods to generate a matched cohort of participants with periodontitis similar to those with none or mild periodontal disease, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were not changed substantially when participants were limited to those with 12 or more natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes of cardiovascular death.Conclusion: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of early death in adults treated with hemodialysis.

AB  - Background: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established.Methods: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty status.Results: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49 (36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61 points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p = 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated with worse frailty status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).Conclusions: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the attitudes, policies, and barriers for requiring annual versus voluntary influenza vaccinations for the staff of healthcare institutions in North Carolina.METHODS: Five different types of institutions serving at-risk elderly populations throughout North Carolina were chosen for study, including hospitals, home health agencies, nursing homes, dialysis centers, and assisted living facilities. Infection control managers completed a 45-question telephone survey on policies for annual influenza vaccinations for employees, incentives to encourage immunizations, support for mandatory influenza vaccinations for workers, barriers to employee vaccinations, and support for a state law to mandate influenza immunizations for-employees with patient care contact.RESULTS: Of 312 institutions, 268 (86%) participated in the study. Only 38% of institutions reported having formal written employee influenza vaccination policies, and only 2% actually mandated annual employee vaccinations. Reported barriers to increasing healthcare worker annual influenza vaccinations included 'fear of side effects' and 'perceived ineffectiveness of the flu vaccine.' Almost half of the respondents would support mandating influenza vaccinations for all healthcare workers with direct patient contact.CONCLUSION: A state-wide survey of the receptivity, policies, and implications of mandated employee influenza vaccinations among healthcare institutions serving the elderly in North Carolina found written policies uncommon and most of the mechanisms used to increase vaccinations voluntary. Efforts should be tailored to individuals, institutions, and healthcare systems to dramatically increase employee immunization rates.

AB  - Frailty is a distinct phenotype that is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and appears to be more prevalent with decreasing glomerular filtration rate. Exercise training or intervention to increase physical activity may ameliorate poor physical functioning and frailty, and even may improve survival in patients with CKD. Although exercise interventions improve outcomes across the spectrum of CKD, including patients treated with dialysis, patients treated with dialysis face barriers to exercise that patients with predialysis CKD do not. Rehabilitation at earlier stages of CKD (or prehabilitation before dialysis) might be more beneficial than not addressing the decreasing physical functioning and low physical activity until patients are receiving dialysis. This review summarizes available literature on frailty in the CKD and end-stage renal disease population, including exercise interventions and the limited evidence for prehabilitation as a strategy.

AB  - Importance: Efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on patients with cancer. High-quality end-of-life care is also critical for patients with other illnesses.Objective: To compare patterns of end-of-life care and family-rated quality of care for patients dying with different serious illnesses.Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in all 146 inpatient facilities within the Veteran Affairs health system among patients who died in inpatient facilities between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2012, with clinical diagnoses categorized as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cancer, cardiopulmonary failure (congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), dementia, frailty, or other conditions. Data analysis was conducted from April 1, 2014, to February 10, 2016.Main Outcomes and Measures: Palliative care consultations, do-not-resuscitate orders, death in inpatient hospices, death in the intensive care unit, and family-reported quality of end-of-life care.Results: Among 57 753 decedents, approximately half of the patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty received palliative care consultations (adjusted proportions, 50.4%, 46.7%, and 43.7%, respectively) vs 73.5% of patients with cancer and 61.4% of patients with dementia (P < .001). Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty (adjusted proportions, 32.3%, 34.1%, and 35.2%, respectively) died in the intensive care unit, more than double the rates among patients with cancer and those with dementia (13.4% and 8.9%, respectively) (P < .001). Rates of excellent quality of end-of-life care reported by 34 005 decedents' families were similar for patients with cancer and those with dementia (adjusted proportions, 59.2% and 59.3%; P = .61), but lower for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty (54.8%, 54.8%, and 53.7%, respectively; all P ≤ .02 vs patients with cancer). This quality advantage was mediated by palliative care consultation, setting of death, and a code status of do-not-resuscitate; adjustment for these variables rendered the association between diagnosis and overall end-of-life care quality nonsignificant.Conclusions and Relevance: Family-reported quality of end-of-life care was significantly better for patients with cancer and those with dementia than for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty, largely owing to higher rates of palliative care consultation and do-not-resuscitate orders and fewer deaths in the intensive care unit among patients with cancer and those with dementia. Increasing access to palliative care and goals of care discussions that address code status and preferred setting of death, particularly for patients with end-organ failure and frailty, may improve the overall quality of end-of-life care for Americans dying of these illnesses.

AB  - Aim The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Methods The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (mL/min/1.73 m2) was determined according to the serum creatinine level, and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0 (normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2. Frailty status was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss. Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty. Results After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2) were more frail (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01−3.59). In addition, individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21−8.24) or hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45−5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.13−14.1) Conclusions A lower level of kidney function was associated with a higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults.

AB  - Background: The pathogenesis of falling is complex, and identification of risk factors may be essential for prevention. The relationship between renal disease and falls is unclear, and the goal of this study was to collect the available evidence and investigate the relationship between accidental falls and renal dysfunction.Methods: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid SP and Web of Science databases to identify the appropriate literature. The themes used were: falls (combined in the title/abstract fall or falls or falling or faller* or fallen or slip* or trip* or (MeSH) accidental falls) and renal insufficiency (chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases combined in title/abstract renal disease* or kidney disease* or renal insufficiency or kidney insufficiency or kidney failure or renal failure or MeSH renal insufficiency, chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases). The incidence, risk factors, complications, and characteristics of the falls were analyzed.Results: Eight prospective cohorts including five cross-sectional studies, and one case-control study were identified. No randomized controlled studies were found. The incidence of falls in chronic kidney disease patients ranged between 1.18 and 1.60 fall/patient year. These were frequent in frail older adults on hemodialysis treatment. Falling relapses in the same group of patients caused serious consequences. Data on pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) were scarce.Conclusions: The risk of falling appears to be common in patients with renal dysfunction especially in older adults undergoing hemodialysis. On the other hand, we could not find any conclusive data on pre-ESRD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of herpes zoster in the dialysis population relative to the general population is not known. The aim of this study was to perform a population-based cohort study to investigate the risk of herpes zoster after the initiation of hemodialysis therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in Taiwan, a country with the highest incidence of ESRD in the world. STUDY DESIGN: Matched cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. 843 patients who were beginning hemodialysis therapy in 1999-2003 were included as the study cohort and 3,372 patients without ESRD matched for age and sex were included as a comparison cohort. A multivariate frailty Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to adjust for confounding and compare the 6-year herpes zoster-free survival rate between these 2 cohorts. PREDICTORS: Hemodialysis. OUTCOMES: Herpes zoster. RESULTS: Mean years of follow-up were 4.73 and 5.49 for the hemodialysis and comparison cohorts, respectively. 868 patients developed herpes zoster throughout the study period, 294 from the hemodialysis cohort and 574 from the comparison cohort. The incidence rate of herpes zoster (73.34 events/1,000 person-year) was significantly higher in the hemodialysis cohort than in the control cohort (31.03 events/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for potential confounders, the adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.72-2.27). LIMITATIONS: We expect that some patients with mild zoster chose not to seek medical help. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients treated with long-term hemodialysis are at an increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The risk of invasive pneumococcal disease is increased among children with some chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to quantify the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in a wide range of chronic diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases of invasive pneumococcal disease among children (aged 0-17 years) were identified from 1977 through 2005 by using a national surveillance program in Denmark. Rate ratios were assessed in a case-control study by using 10 age- and gender-matched controls per case. Chronic diseases were defined a priori. RESULTS: Among 1655 children with invasive pneumococcal disease, 19% had a history of chronic disease, according to our definition, versus 5% of controls. An increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease was observed for children followed >30 days after initial hospital contact for a chronic disease, but it was also increased in children with >or=5 hospital contacts for any other reason. Children with a history of cancer, chronic renal disease, splenectomy, and transplantation were particularly susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease. Adjusted for number of hospital contacts, the risk for children with other types of chronic disease was 1.4-fold more than for those with hospital contacts for any reason. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer, chronic renal diseases, splenectomy, and transplantation were strongly associated with an increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in children. For children with other chronic diseases, their excess risk seemed to be attributable mostly to frail children having repeated hospital contact rather than their underlying condition.

AB  - SUMMARY Background Many people on dialysis suffer a variety of conditions that can affect frailty (the condition or quality of being frail), such as comorbidities, disabilities, dependence, malnutrition, cognitive impairment and poor social conditions. Frailty is suspected to affect quality of life (QoL). Objectives The study aimed to evaluate the effect of the different components of frailty on the QoL of people on dialysis. Methods We enrolled 203 out of 233 prevalent patients on dialysis in the Trieste area of Italy. We applied the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire, Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Subjective Global Assessment scales and Karnofsky Index. In addition we analysed their social conditions. Results Dependence, malnutrition and disability had a negative role on QoL. Living with family and good social-economic conditions were significantly related to a better QoL. Conclusions Dependence, malnutrition, disability, poor social and economic conditions have a significant effect on life quality. The role of comorbidities appears to be less important. Screening of patients, nutritional and functional rehabilitation and prevention of social isolation appear to be indispensable in guaranteeing a satisfactory life quality.

AB  - The prevalence of end-stage renal disease is rising in the United States, which bears high financial and public health burden. The most common modality of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the United States is in-center hemodialysis. Many patients report lack of comprehensive and timely education about their treatment options, which may preclude them from participating in home-based dialysis therapies and kidney transplantation evaluation. While RRT education has traditionally been provided in-person, the rise of telehealth has afforded new opportunities to improve upon the status quo. For example, technology-augmented RRT education has recently been implemented into telehealth nephrology clinics, informational websites and mobile applications maintained by professional organizations, patient-driven forums on social media, and multimodality programs. The benefits of technology in RRT education are increased access for geographically isolated and/or medically frail patients, versatility of content delivery, information repetition to enhance knowledge retention, and interpersonal connection for educational content and emotional support. Challenges center around privacy and accuracy of information sharing, in addition to differential access to technology due to age and socioeconomic status. A review of available scholarly and social media resources suggests that technology-aided delivery of education about treatment options for end-stage renal disease provides an important alternative and/or supplemental resource for patients and families.

AB  - Background: The modified frailty index (mFI) has been shown to predict adverse outcomes in multiple nonorthopedic surgical specialties. This study aimed to assess whether mFI is a predictor of adverse events in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA).Methods: Patients who underwent THA and TKA from 2005-2012 were identified in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. mFI was calculated for each patient using 15 variables found in National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Bivariate and multivariate analyses of postoperative adverse events, including Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications, were performed.Results: A total of 14,583 THA and 25,223 TKA patients were included for analysis. The mean (standard deviation, range) mFIs were 0.083 (0.080, 0-0.55) for THA and 0.097 (0.080, 0-0.64) for TKA cohorts. On bivariate analyses, incidence of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications (cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, septic shock, pulmonary embolism, postoperative dialysis, reintubation, and prolonged ventilator requirement), hospital-acquired conditions (surgical site infection, venous thromboembolism, and urinary tract infection), any complications, and mortality increased significantly with increase in mFI (P < .0001 for all). Adjusting for demographics, age ≥ 75, body mass index ≥40, American Society of Anesthesiologists class ≥4, and nonclean wound status, mFI ≥0.45 was shown to be the strongest independent predictor of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications for both THA and TKA cohorts with odds ratios of 5.140 and 4.183, respectively.Conclusion: mFI ≥0.45 is an independent predictor of Clavien-Dindo grade IV complications in TKA/THA patients with greater odds ratios than age >75, body mass index ≥40, American Society of Anesthesiologists class ≥4. mFI should be considered for risk stratifying joint arthroplasty patients preoperatively and perhaps determining immediate postoperative destination.

AB  - Hip fracture is a common occurrence in the elderly. Due to the growing demand for the specific care of these patients, we established the Orthogeriatric Unit (OGU) at San Gerardo University Hospital (Italy) in 2007. However, simultaneous bilateral femoral neck fractures among the geriatric population (those aged ≥65 years) are rarely reported in the literature. Reporting the rare case of a frail 76-year-old woman admitted with bilateral hip fracture and end-stage renal disease, we explain the important role played by the OGU and its flexible multidisciplinary approach for providing comprehensive care to patients with multimorbidity and clinical complexity. The team of geriatricians, orthopedic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and, in this case, a nephrologist, helped in the careful planning and timing of the single-step surgical repair, decided the appropriate type of anesthesia, and optimized outcomes. After a prompt evaluation of the patient, the OGU approach can achieve clinical stabilization prior to intervention. Along with a strict follow-up in the postoperative phase, this could result in a significant reduction of complications and mortality rates and an early start to a tailored rehabilitation process. We strongly suggest employing facilities with multidisciplinary teams for cases involving complex patients at short-term high risk for poor clinical outcomes. Indeed, the usual single-specialist model of care is gradually being abandoned worldwide.

AB  - Background: Aim of our study is to describe, in people with CKD, the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes with increasing age. The prevalence of CKD in Western populations, where longevity is the norm, is about 10-15%, but how age influence different characteristics of patients with CKD is largely not known.Methods: One thousand two hundred sixty-five patients enrolled in the CKD.QLD registry at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital were grouped according to age at consent i.e. <35, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+ years age groups, and were followed till start of renal replacement therapy (RRT), death, discharge or the censor date of September 2015.Results: Age ranged from 17.6 to 98.5 years with medians of 70.1 and 69.9 years for males and females respectively: 7% were <35 years of age, with the majority (63%) >65 years old. The leading renal diagnoses changed from genetic real disease (GRD) and glomerulonephritis (GN) in the younger patients to renovascular disease (RVD) and hypertension (HTN) in older patients. With increasing age, there were often multiple renal disease diagnoses, more advanced stages of CKD, greater number of comorbidities, more frequent and more costly hospitalizations, and higher death rates. The rates of initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) rose from 4.5 per 100 person years in those age < 35 years to a maximum of 5.5 per 100 person years in 45-54 years age group and were lowest, at 0.5 per 100 person years in those >85 years. Mortality rates increased by age group from 1.3 to 17.0 per 100 person years in 35-44 year and 85+ year age groups respectively. Rates of hospitalization, length of stay and cost progressively increased from the youngest to eldest groups. Patients with diabetic nephropathy had highest incidence rate of RRT and death. The proportion of patients who lost more than 5mls/min/1.73m2 of eGFR during at least 12 months follow up increased from 13.3% in the youngest age group to 29.2% in the eldest.Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive view, with no exclusions, of CKD patients seen in a public renal specialty referral practice, in Australia. The age distribution of patients encompasses the whole of adult life, with a broader range and higher median value than patients receiving RRT. Health status ranged from a single system (renal) disease in young adults through, with advancing age, renal impairment as a component of, or accompanying multisystem diseases, to demands and complexities of support of frail or elderly people approaching end of life. This great spectrum demands a broad understanding and capacity of renal health care providers, and dictates a need for a wider scope of health services provision incorporating multiple models of care.

AB  - Treatment with dialysis has benefitted large numbers of patients with advanced kidney disease. It is though highly intrusive and demanding and some elderly, frail patients may tolerate it poorly. Some of these patients who are either approaching 'end-stage' kidney disease or 'failing' despite being on dialysis may choose to pursue supportive or palliative approaches, partially or fully replacing the dialysis option. Here, we describe some of the challenges confronting these patients and present data on the attitudes and perceptions to supportive care and end-of-life care planning of patients on haemodialysis including some whose prognosis was poor. The main focus for these patients appeared to be on holding on to what they had, adapting by living 'from day to day' in the present, and continuing to hope for the best. Advance care planning was seen as potentially useful by patients, once clarity surrounding its purpose had been established.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Despite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of physical functioning and encouragement of physical activity in management of the patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), implementation has been undermined by a lack of understanding of the evidence for this recommendation. The purpose of this review is to present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic cohorts that report associations between low levels of physical functioning and/or low physical activity and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.Recent Findings: Low levels of physical activity and poor physical functioning are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical outcomes in adult patients with CKD, regardless of treatment modality. Low physical performance and activity limitations are more prevalent in patients with CKD, regardless of age, compared to older community-dwelling adults.Summary: The strength of the evidence presented should strongly motivate a focus of treatment on assessing and improving physical activity and physical function as part of routine patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical activity interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that is similar to or higher than the general population of elderly adults; physical activity, physical function, and performance are strongly associated with all-cause mortality; and exercise training and exercise counseling have been shown to improve measures of physical functioning.

AB  - Decisions and discussions about the initiation of dialysis in the elderly are often challenging because of the high prevalence of comorbidities and frailty in this population. Mortality is high, functional decline is likely, and quality of life tends to be lower in the elderly on dialysis. It is thus important to counsel these patients on the risks, benefits, and burdens of dialysis to assist them in making an informed choice that is in line with their goals, preferences, and expectations. For some patients, dialysis may be a desirable choice. For others, the alternative of palliative care may provide a more favorable balance of benefits versus burdens. Elderly patients who choose to proceed with dialysis often benefit from an interdisciplinary team that helps to manage and monitor their health status, while maximizing the benefits of treatment and decreasing its potential harms. These goals can be promoted by effective communication and through individualized decisions about vascular access, medication choices, and dietary limitations. Finally, close monitoring of functional status will help to determine whether dialysis remains in a patient's best interest and when alternatives should be offered.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Frailty is highly prevalent in the dialysis population and is associated with mortality. Recent studies have suggested that other dialysis outcomes are compromised in frail individuals. While we do not yet have a consensus as to the best measure of frailty, identification of these poor outcomes and their magnitude of association with frailty will help improve prognostication, allow for earlier interventions, and improve provider-to-patient communication.Recent Findings: The most widely used assessment of frailty is Fried's physical performance criteria. However, regardless of assessment method, frailty remains highly associated with mortality. More recently, frailty has been associated with falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, vascular access failure, and poor quality of life. Recent large cohort studies provide strong evidence that frailty assessment can provide important prognostic information for providers and patients both before and after initiation of dialysis. Trials aimed at improving frailty are limited and show the promise of augmenting quality of life, although more studies are needed to firmly establish mortality benefits.Summary: We underscore the importance of frailty as a prognostic indicator and identify other recently established consequences of frailty. Widespread adoption of frailty assessment remains limited and researchers continue to find ways of simplifying the data collection process. Timely and regular assessment of frailty may allow for interventions that can mitigate the onset of poor outcomes and identify actionable targets for dialysis providers.

Journal of Advanced Nursing 68(6), 1716-1725. Abstract Aim. This paper is a report of a study conducted to explore how the family members of older people who will undergo haemodialysis treatment for the rest of their lives perceive participation. Background. The rights of families to participate in treatment and health care are supported by international law, and by national law in Norway since 1999. Method. This study, which employed an explorative qualitative approach, was carried out in Norway in 2008. Data were derived from transcribed interviews with seven family members underwent critical discourse analysis. Findings. Three discourse practices about the next of kin perception of participation were found: (1) to care and take control, (2) to struggle for involvement, and (3) to be forgotten and powerless. The next of kin said that they had no dialogue with the healthcare team, and some fought to be included in the decision-making process. Conclusion. The dominant part of the discourse as expressed by the next of kin seems to be a paternalistic ideology. Thus, finding ways to enable the next of kin to participate in the decision-making process seems to be a major challenge for the healthcare team in the dialysis units.

AB  - This study investigated the outcomes and the prognostic factors among the very elderly (patients ≥80 years old) requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV).Between 2006 and 2014, all of the very elderly patients of age 80 or more transferred to respiratory care center (RCC) of a tertiary medical center were retrospectively identified, and only patients who used mechanical ventilation (MV) for >3 weeks were included in this study.A total of 510 very elderly patients undergoing PMV were identified. The mean age of the patients was 84.3 ± 3.3 years, and it ranged from 80 to 96 years. Male comprised most of the patients (n = 269, 52.7%), and most of the patients were transferred to RCC from medical ICU (n = 357, 70.0%). The APACHE II scores on RCC admission was 17.6 ± 6.0. At least 1 comorbidity was found in 419 (82.2%) patients. No significant differences of gender, disease severity, diagnosis, dialysis, laboratory examinations, comorbidities, and outcome were found between octogenarians (aged 80-89) and nonagenarians (aged ≥ 90). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 21.8%. In the multivariate analysis, patients who had APACHE II score ≥ 15(odds ratio [OR], 2.30, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-3.90), or albumin ≤ 2 g/dL (OR, 3.92, 95% CI, 2.17-7.01) were more likely to have significant in-hospital mortality (P < 0.05).The in-hospital mortality rate of the very elderly PMV patients in our RCC is 21.8%, and poor outcomes in this specific population were found to be associated with a higher APACHE II score and lower albumin level.

AB  - Recurrent event data are commonly observed in biomedical longitudinal studies. In many instances, there exists a terminal event, which precludes the occurrence of additional repeated events, and usually there is also a nonignorable correlation between the terminal event and recurrent events. In this article, we propose a partly Aalen's additive model with a multiplicative frailty for the rate function of recurrent event process and assume a Cox frailty model for terminal event time. A shared gamma frailty is used to describe the correlation between the two types of events. Consequently, this joint model can provide the information of temporal influence of absolute covariate effects on the rate of recurrent event process, which is usually helpful in the decision-making process for physicians. An estimating equation approach is developed to estimate marginal and association parameters in the joint model. The consistency of the proposed estimator is established. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed approach is appropriate for practical use. We apply the proposed method to a peritonitis cohort data set for illustration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty has been defined as a tool to define individuals who lack functional reserve and are at risk for functional decline. We hypothesized that chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) would be associated with a greater prevalence of frailty and disability in the elderly. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data collected from the Cardiovascular Health Study, which enrolled 5,888 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older from 4 clinical centers in the United States. Renal insufficiency is defined as a serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL or greater (> or =115 micromol/L) in women and 1.5 mg/dL or greater (> or =133 micromol/L) in men. Frailty is defined by the presence of 3 of the following abnormalities: unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, measured weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Disability is defined as any self-reported difficulty with activities of daily living. RESULTS: Among 5,808 participants with creatinine levels measured at entry, 15.9% of men (n = 394) and 7.6% of women (n = 254) had CRI. Prevalences of frailty (15% versus 6%; P < 0.001) and disability (12% versus 7%; P = 0.001) were greater in participants with CRI compared with those with normal renal function. After multivariate adjustment for comorbidity, CRI remained significantly associated with frailty (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.41), but not disability (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.69). CONCLUSION: Elderly persons with CRI have a high prevalence of frailty, which may signal their risk for progression to adverse health outcomes. If confirmed in other studies, identification of frailty in patients with CRI may warrant special interventions to preserve their independence, quality of life, and survival.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical implications of frailty in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and chronic peritoneal dialysis.Design: In this prospective study, all of the participants completed the Short Form of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, Korean version, to determine their frailty phenotype. We also obtained blood chemistry and demographic data at enrollment. Data regarding the history of hospitalization and death were collected during the follow-up period.Subjects: We recruited 1,658 patients (1,255 maintenance hemodialysis and 403 chronic peritoneal dialysis) from multidialysis units (n = 27). We excluded patients who had been hospitalized in the previous 3 months.Main Outcome Measures: Hospitalization and survival rate during study period.Results: The participants' mean age was 55.2 ± 11.9 years old, and 55.2% were male. Among the participants, 34.8% were rated as frail and 45.7% as prefrail. Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant associations of frailty with age, comorbidity, disability, unemployment, higher body mass index, and a lower educational level. During the follow-up period (median 17.1 months), 608 patients (79 not frail, 250 prefrail, and 279 frail) were hospitalized, and 87 patients (10 not frail, 24 prefrail, and 53 frail) died (P < .001). Frailty was associated with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.38-2.36) and mortality (hazard ratio, 2.37, 95% confidence interval: 1.11-5.02).Conclusion: The frailty phenotype was common even in, prevalent end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis, and was significantly associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality.

AB  - Most patients starting dialysis can choose between peritoneal dialysis and haemodialysis. There is little evidence proving that one form of dialysis is better than the other; although there may be an early advantage to peritoneal dialysis (PD) in young patients with residual function this effect is short-lived. Technique failure develops after years on PD so dialysis modality will often change during a long dialysis career. Quality of life studies, which must be interpreted carefully, indicate that patients require information about the impact of dialysis on their lifestyle as well as health-related outcomes so that they can choose the most suitable dialysis modality. Increasing numbers of frail elderly patients are starting dialysis; support in the home by nursing staff may facilitate the use of PD in this group. In the UK guidelines prioritise the patient's choice of dialysis modality (where feasible) based on good quality predialysis education. Cost of treatment is generally lower on PD, which is particularly recommended for patients with residual renal function and few comorbidities.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although therapeutic failure may be a common cause of drug-related morbidity in older adults, few studies have focused on this problem. The study objective was to determine the frequency and types of, and the factors associated with, therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients, using a new instrument named the Therapeutic Failure Questionnaire (TFQ). METHODS: The sample included 106 frail, hospitalised elderly patients enrolled in a 1-year-long health service intervention trial at 11 Veterans Affairs Medical Centres. The TFQ was developed by a team of clinical geriatricians and tested for reliability by two clinical pharmacists and a geriatrician on a sample of 32 patients. To establish validity, a geriatrician retrospectively reviewed the computerised medication records and clinical charts for these patients and applied the TFQ to determine probable therapeutic failures at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: Inter- and intra-rater reliability for the TFQ were very good (kappa = 0.82 for both). Overall, 11% of patients had one or more probable therapeutic failures (TFQ scores between 4 and 7) leading to hospitalisation. Cardiopulmonary disease was a common 'indicator' of therapeutic failure and was often the result of non-adherence. The only factor associated with therapeutic failure occurrence was severe chronic kidney disease (crude odds ratio 5.87; 95% CI 1.20, 28.69; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The TFQ was able to identify several cases of probable therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients. Non-adherence to effective therapies for chronic serious cardiopulmonary disease was a common cause of therapeutic failure and represents a target for interventions to reduce hospitalisation. Further research on the occurrence, risk factors for and types of therapeutic failure is needed in a larger cohort of older non-veterans.

AB  - A new study reports that 30.5% of kidney transplant recipients have an early hospital readmission (EHR; defined as within 30 days of discharge). As EHR is a strong independent risk factor for allograft loss and mortality, efforts should be made to implement and improve systems to minimize risk of EHR in these patients.

AB  - Advanced age is one of the major determinants of frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis. However, multiple other factors contribute to frailty in these patients. The identification of frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis is critical as it influences the complexity of the anticoagulant treatment in this population at high risk of venous thromboembolism and bleeding. Factors that contribute to frailty in patients with cancer-associated thrombosis include age, type of cancer, comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, poly-pharmacotherapy, treatment compliance, cognitive impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mobility, nutritional status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group grade, risk of falls, and reduced life expectancy. In the absence of specific clinical studies current anticoagulant treatment guidelines for the management are not fully applicable to frail patients with cancer. The anticoagulant treatment should therefore benefit from a tailored approach based on an algorithm that takes into account the specificities of the malignant disease.

AB  - In the age of person-centered care, there is an emphasis on promoting patient autonomy and surrogate decision maker authority in making treatment decisions that are aligned with the patient's priorities and values. As technological advances offer multiple clinical options with various levels and types of risks and benefits, person-centered clinical practice encourages the incorporation of patients' and families' heterogeneous experiences into decisions regarding illness management. In caring for frail elderly adults, clinicians are sometimes faced with situations in which individuals and their surrogate decision-makers request a treatment that the clinicians feel is clinically inappropriate. This article provides a case example of a frail older adult with advanced chronic kidney disease who requests dialysis despite the advice of his nephrologist to pursue conservative management. The four-box approach, which provides clinicians with a structured ethical framework to facilitate informed and ethically justified treatment decisions, is then introduced. By considering the patient's medical indications, preferences, quality of life, and contextual factors, how each consideration plays a unique yet equally important role in informing clinically responsible and person-centered care is illustrated.

AB  - Background Nurse-assisted automated peritoneal dialysis (AAPD) offers a model of care that has been successfully used in frail dialysis populations internationally. AAPD offers cost savings over hospitalisation on peritoneal dialysis (PD) or in-centre haemodialysis (HD). Method A pilot AAPD model of care was developed in Western Australia (WA). Patient evaluation was measured utilising a perceptions of dialysis survey, clinical events, hospitalisation and peritonitis rates, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), KDQoL-SF 36 and a survey. Staff opinions and perceived competency were measured by an online survey. Economic analysis was undertaken. Results A successful collaborative model was developed. 40 staff were trained and competency significantly improved during program delivery (p<0.0001). 15 patients with an average CCI score of 8.7 used the service for 18 periods of care over 18 months (mean 33 days SD 47). Two non-renal cause deaths and two episodes of peritonitis occurred. Patient opinions were extremely positive. Cost savings were estimated at $620,000. Conclusion In WA, an AAPD pilot program has been successfully developed and delivered. A sustainable model has overcome initial hurdles. Staff have gained new skills and delivered effective care, demonstrated by high patient acceptance. The program was cost-effective compared to staying in hospital or transferring to HD.
