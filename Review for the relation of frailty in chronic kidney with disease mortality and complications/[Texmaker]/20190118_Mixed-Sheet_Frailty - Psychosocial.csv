Frailty: Fried phenotypes
Grouping: nonfrail and frail (intermediate frail and frail combined)
HRQOL: KDQOL-SF (generic core [Short Form-36 (SF-36)] and 11 multi-item kidney disease-specific scales), scores linearly converted to 0 to 100 scales.
ANALYSIS METHOD
Relationship between frailty and physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific HRQOL at KT: Multivariable linear regression
Within-individual changes in HRQOL scores among frail and nonfrail recipients: paired t test
HRQOL between frail and nonfrail: Student t test
