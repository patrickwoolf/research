abstract = {Purpose: To compare the perception of the quality of life (QOL) of community-dwelling older adults with the phenotype of frailty. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data of the “Cohort of Obesity, Sarcopenia and Frailty of Mexican Older Adults” (COSFOMA). Operationalization of frailty was carried out using the phenotype as follows: weight loss, self-report of exhaustion, low physical activity, slow gait, and weakness. QOL was measured using two scales: World Health Organization Quality of Life of Older Adults (WHOQOL-OLD), which is a specific instrument for the elderly population, and Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), a generic instrument to evaluate the QOL related to health. One-way analyses of variance were conducted to assess the differences among the three phenotypes of frailty and QOL perception. Results: There were 1252 older adult participants who were analyzed; 11.2{\%} (n = 140) had frailty, 50.3{\%} (n = 630) pre-frailty and 38.5{\%} (n = 482) were not frail. The mean (±SD) total score of the WHOQOL-OLD according to the phenotype of frailty was 60.3 (13.9) for those with frailty, 67.4 (12.7) pre-frailty and 72.4 (11.2) not frail (ANOVA, p {\textless} 0.001). The mean (±SD) of the SF-36 of the physical and mental component measures the sum, 38.9 (9.9) and 41.9 (11.3) with frailty, 45.7 (9.1) and 46.6 (9.8) pre-frailty, and 49.6 (7.3) and 49.4 (7.9) not frail, respectively (ANOVA, p {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions: Frailty is observed in 1/10 community-dwelling older adults. Those with frailty and pre-frailty had a lower perception of QOL compared with those who were not frail.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND People living with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience compromised quality of life. Consequently, it is critical to identify and understand factors influencing their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study examined factors associated with HRQoL among patients with diabetes and CKD. METHODS A cross sectional study among adults with comorbid diabetes and CKD (eGFR {\textless}60 mL/min/1.73m2) recruited from renal and diabetes clinics of four large tertiary referral hospitals in Australia was performed. Each participant completed the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQoL ™ -36) questionnaire, which is comprised of two composite measures of physical and mental health and 3 kidney disease specific subscales with possible scores ranging from 0 to 100 with higher values indicating better HRQoL. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. Regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship between HRQoL and potential predictor factors. RESULTS A total of 308 patients were studied with a mean age of 66.9 (SD = 11.0) years and 70{\%} were males. Mean scores for the physical composite summary, mental composite summary, symptom/problem list, effects of kidney disease and burden of kidney disease scales were 35.2, 47.0, 73.8, 72.5 and 59.8 respectively. Younger age was associated with lower scores in all subscales except for the physical composite summary. Female gender, obese or normal weight rather than overweight, and smoking were all associated with lower scores in one or more subscales. Scores were progressively lower with more advanced stage of CKD (p{\textless}0.05) in all subscales except for the mental composite summary. CONCLUSION In patients with diabetes and CKD, younger age was associated with lower scores in all HRQoL subscales except the physical composite summary and female gender, obese or normal weight and more advanced stages of CKD were associated with lower scores in one or more subscales. Identifying these factors will inform the timely implementation of interventions to improve the quality of life of these patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coping with the stresses of chronic disease is considered as a key factor in the perceived impairment of health related quality of life (HRQL). Little is known though about these associations in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present study aimed to investigate the relationship of defensive coping and HRQL among patients in different CKD stages, after adjusting for psychological distress, sociodemographic and disease-related variables.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The sample consisted of 98 CKD patients, attending a university nephrology department. Seventy-nine (79) pre-dialysis patients of disease stages 3 to 4 and 19 dialysis patients were included. HRQL was assessed by the 36-item Short-Form health survey (SF-36), defensive coping by the Rationality/Emotional Defensiveness (R/ED) scale of the Lifestyle Defense Mechanism Inventory (LDMI) and psychological distress by the depression and anxiety scales of the revised Hopkins Symptom CheckList (SCL-90-R). Regression analyses were carried out to examine the association between SF-36 dimensions and defensive coping style.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Patients on dialysis had worse scores on SF-36 scales measuring physical aspects of HRQL. In the fully adjusted analysis, a higher defensive coping score was significantly associated with a lower score on the mental component summary (MCS) scale of the SF-36 (worse mental health). In contrast, a higher defensive score showed a small positive association with the physical component summary (PCS) scale of the SF-36 (better health), but this was marginally significant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results provided evidence that emotional defensiveness as a coping style tends to differentially affect the mental and the physical component of HRQL in CKD. Clinicians should be aware of the effects of long-term denial and could examine the possibility of screening for defensive coping and depression in recently diagnosed CKD patients with the aim to improve both physical and mental health.},

abstract = {Spiritual well-being is viewed as an essential component of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in the modernized biopsychosocial-spiritual model of health. Understanding spiritual well-being should lead to better treatment plans from the patients' point of view, and improved patient adherence. There are numerous studies of traditional HRQOL, physical, mental, and social well-being; however, studies of spiritual well-being in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are limited. Thus, this study compared spiritual well-being of chronic hemodialysis patients and pre-dialysis CKD patients. A total of 31 chronic hemodialysis and 63 pre-dialysis CKD patients were asked for consent and then interviewed for spiritual well-being using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy–Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp). Analysis of covariance was applied to compare FACIT-Sp scores between pre-dialysis CKD and chronic hemodialysis groups that were adjusted by patient characteristics. The FACIT-Sp scores of pre-dialysis CKD patients were non-significantly greater than those of chronic hemodialysis patients after adjustment for gender, age, and marital status. However, all FACIT-Sp scores of males were significantly lower than those of females [FACIT Meaning −1.59 (p = 0.024), FACIT Peace −2.37 $\backslash$r$\backslash$n(p = 0.004), FACIT Faith −2.87 (p = 0.001), FACIT Total Score −6.83 (p = 0.001)]. The spiritual well-being did not significantly differ by stages of chronic kidney disease; however, patient gender was associated with spiritual well-being instead. To improve spiritual well-being, researchers should consider patient gender as a significant factor.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reflects a patient's disease burden, treatment effectiveness, and health status and is summarized by physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific scales among end-stage renal disease patients. Although on average HRQOL improves postkidney transplant (KT), the degree of change depends on the ability of the patient to withstand the stressor of dialysis versus the ability to tolerate the intense physiologic changes of KT. Frail KT recipients may be extra vulnerable to either of these stressors, thus affecting change in HRQOL after KT. METHODS We ascertained frailty, as well as physical, mental, and kidney disease-specific HRQOL in a multicenter prospective cohort of 443 KT recipients (May 2014 to May 2017) using Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short Form. We quantified the short-term (3 months) rate of post-KT HRQOL change by frailty status using adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models. RESULTS Mean HRQOL scores at KT were 43.3 (SD, 9.6) for physical, 52.8 (SD, 8.9) for mental, and 72.6 (SD, 12.8) for kidney disease-specific HRQOL; frail recipients had worse physical (P {\textless} 0.001) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (P = 0.001), but similar mental HRQOL (P = 0.43). Frail recipients experienced significantly greater rates of improvement in physical HRQOL (frail, 1.35 points/month; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.65-2.05; nonfrail, 0.34 points/month; 95{\%} CI, -0.17-0.85; P = 0.02) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (frail, 3.75 points/month; 95{\%} CI, 2.89-4.60; nonfrail, 2.41 points/month; 95{\%} CI, 1.78-3.04; P = 0.01), but no difference in mental HRQOL (frail, 0.54 points/month; 95{\%} CI, -0.17-1.25; nonfrail, 0.46 points/month; 95{\%} CI, -0.06-0.98; P = 0.85) post-KT. CONCLUSIONS Despite decreased physiologic reserve, frail recipients experience improvement in post-KT physical and kidney disease-specific HRQOL better than nonfrail recipients.},

abstract = {Background: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose reduction or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead to rejection and possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known about what factors might cause or contribute to MDR. Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is emerging as an important, novel domain of risk in kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. We hypothesized that frailty, an inflammatory phenotype, might be associated with MDR. Methods: We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor characteristics, longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 KT recipients. Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. Results: By 2 years post-transplant, 54{\%} of frail recipients and 45{\%} of non-frail recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67{\%} and 51{\%}. Frail recipients were 1.29-times (95{\%}CI:1.01-1.66; P=0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased donor recipients (aHR=1.92, 95{\%}CI:1.44-2.54, P{\textless}0.001) and older adults (age≥65 vs. {\textless}65; aHR=1.47, 95{\%}CI: 1.10-1.96, P=0.01). MDR was independently associated with a substantially increased risk of death-censored graft loss (aHR=5.24, 95{\%}CI:1.97-13.98, P=0.001). Conclusion: A better understanding of risk factors for MMF intolerance might help in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression and prolong allograft survival.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Patients of all ages undergoing hemodialysis (HD) have a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and worse cognitive function than healthy controls, and those with dementia are at high risk of death. Frailty has been associated with poor cognitive function in older adults without kidney disease. We hypothesized that frailty might also be associated with poor cognitive function in adults of all ages undergoing HD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, {\&} MEASUREMENTS At HD initiation, 324 adults enrolled (November 2008 to July 2012) in a longitudinal cohort study (Predictors of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in ESRD) were classified into three groups (frail, intermediately frail, and nonfrail) based on the Fried frailty phenotype. Global cognitive function (3MS) and speed/attention (Trail Making Tests A and B [TMTA and TMTB, respectively]) were assessed at cohort entry and 1-year follow-up. Associations between frailty and cognitive function (at cohort entry and 1-year follow-up) were evaluated in adjusted (for sex, age, race, body mass index, education, depression and comorbidity at baseline) linear (3MS, TMTA) and Tobit (TMTB) regression models. RESULTS At cohort entry, the mean age was 54.8 years (SD 13.3), 56.5{\%} were men, and 72.8{\%} were black. The prevalence of frailty and intermediate frailty were 34.0{\%} and 37.7{\%}, respectively. The mean 3MS was 89.8 (SD 7.6), TMTA was 55.4 (SD 29), and TMTB was 161 (SD 83). Frailty was independently associated with lower cognitive function at cohort entry for all three measures (3MS: -2.4 points; 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI], -4.2 to -0.5; P=0.01; TMTA: 12.1 seconds; 95{\%} CI, 4.7 to 19.4; P{\textless}0.001; and TMTB: 33.2 seconds; 95{\%} CI, 9.9 to 56.4; P=0.01; all tests for trend, P{\textless}0.001) and with worse 3MS at 1-year follow-up (-2.8 points; 95{\%} CI, -5.4 to -0.2; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS In adult incident HD patients, frailty is associated with worse cognitive function, particularly global cognitive function (3MS).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND It is difficult to obtain detailed information on non-participants in physical and health examination checkups in community-based epidemiological studies. We investigated the characteristics of non-participants in a physical and health examination checkup for older adults in a nested study from the Japanese Kyoto-Kameoka Longitudinal Study. METHODS We approached a total of 4831 people aged ≥65 years in 10 randomly selected intervention regions. Participants responded to a mail-based population survey on needs in the sphere of daily life to encourage participation in a free face-to-face physical checkup examination; 1463 participants (706 men, 757 women) participated in the physical checkup. A multiple logistic regression model was performed to investigate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of non-participation based on sociodemographic status apart from psychological and physiological frailty as assessed by the validated Kihon Checklist. RESULTS There was a significant, inverse relationship between non-participation and frequently spending time alone among individuals who lived with someone or other family structure (aOR = 0.53, standard error [SE] 0.08 in men, aOR = 0.66, SE 0.09 in women). Very elderly (over 80 years old) women, poorer health consciousness and current smoking in both sexes and poor self-rated health in men, were significantly related to higher non-participation rates. In both sexes, individuals who did not participate in community activities were significantly more likely to be non-participants than individuals who did (aOR = 1.94, SE 0.23 in men, aOR = 3.29, SE 0.39 in women). Having low IADL and physical functioning scores were also associated with higher rates of non-participation. CONCLUSION Health consciousness and lack of community activity participation were predictors of non-participation in a physical checkup examination among older adults. In addition, lower IADL and physical functioning/strength were also predictors of non-participation. On the contrary, older inhabitants living with someone tended to participate in the physical checkup examination for social interchange when they were frequently alone in the household. This study suggests the importance of considering aging especially for women and poor sociodemographic background and physical frailty for both sexes so that older people can access health programs without difficulty.

This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition, HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5). Methods: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale); depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools. Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights {\textgreater}136 kg, and coinciding comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded. Results: Frailty occurred in 17{\%} of participants (n=7). Frail participants had lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more depression (p={\textless}0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p{\textless}0.05). No differences in health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail participants (p{\textgreater}0.05). Conclusions: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To determine if adding frailty measures to the EuroSCORE II improves model performance in predicting postoperative delirium. 

METHODS
In a prospective observational study in elective cardiac surgery patients, frailty was defined using the Modified Fried Criteria (MFC), the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and a 35-item Frailty Index (FI). The primary outcome was postoperative delirium, assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). 

RESULTS
Seventy-two (54.1{\%}) of the 133 participants met the MFC definition for frailty and 69 (51.9{\%}) met the SPPB definition. Eighty-eight (66.2{\%}) participants had an FI score ≥0.2, and 47 (35.3{\%}) had a score ≥0.3. After adjusting for the EuroSCORE II, frail patients as identified by the MFC were at increased risk of postoperative delirium (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.05, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.58-16.13). Patients in the “high risk frailty” SPPB category had even greater risk (adjusted OR, 8.26, 95{\%} CI, 2.23-30.64). FI scores ≥0.3 were also associated with higher risk of delirium (adjusted OR, 3.72, 95{\%} CI, 1.39-9.92). The inclusion of any of these definitions of frailty improved the discrimination of the EuroSCORE II in predicting postoperative delirium. 

CONCLUSIONS
Frailty results in a 3- to 8-fold increase in risk of postoperative delirium, independent of the EuroSCORE II. “Frail” and “fit” may be considered 2 ends of a continuum, and the risk of postoperative delirium grows as one becomes increasingly frail. The addition of frailty improves the ability of the EuroSCORE II to predict postoperative delirium, pointing to opportunities for improved prevention and management.},

In light of the demographic characteristics of patients with CKD and ESRD, there has been considerable focus on associations between CKD and cardiovascular outcomes.(3) Until recently, less attention had been paid to other consequences of CKD in general and among older individuals with CKD in particular, but there is now solid evidence linking CKD with impairments of physical function, cognitive function, and emotional function and quality of life. This review summarizes available literature on these topics, focusing specifically on physical functioning and frailty, cognitive function, emotional health, including depression and anxiety, and health-related quality of life.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. However, apart from its influence on cognition, it is currently unknown whether frailty affects subtler cerebral function in patients with ESRD. METHODS: Patients with ESRD were prospectively enrolled, with clinical features and laboratory data recorded. The severity of frailty among these patients with ESRD was ascertained using the previously validated simple FRAIL scale, and was categorized as none-to-mild and moderate-to-severe frailty. All participants underwent quantitative electroencephalography (EEG), with band powers documented following the generation of the delta to alpha ratio (DAR) and delta/theta to alpha/beta ratio (DTABR). EEG results were then compared between groups of different levels of frailty. RESULTS: In this cohort, (mean age: 68.9 +/- 10.4 years, 37{\%} male, 3.4 +/- 3 years of dialysis), 20, 60, 40, 17, and 6{\%} patients exhibited positivity in the fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss-of-body-weight domains, respectively, with 45.7{\%} being none to mildly frail and 54.3{\%} being moderately to severely frail. Those with mild frailty had a significantly higher delta power compared to those with more severe frailty, involving all topographic sites. Patients with ESRD and severe frailty had significantly lower global, left frontal, left temporo-occipital, and right temporo-occipital DAR and DTABR, except in the right frontal area, and tended to have central accentuation of alpha, beta, and theta power, and more homogeneous DTABR and DAR distribution compared to the findings in those with mild frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in patients with ESRD can have subtler neurophysiological influences, presenting as altered EEG findings, which warrant our attention.},

abstract = {Studies of frailty among patients on hemodialysis have relied on definitions that substitute self-reported functioning for measures of physical performance and omit weight loss or substitute alternate criteria. We examined the association between body composition and a definition of frailty that includes measured physical performance and weight loss in a cross-sectional analysis of 638 adult patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis at 14 centers. Frailty was defined as having three of following characteristics: weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed. We performed logistic regression with body mass index (BMI) and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS)-derived estimates of intracellular water (ICW), fat mass, and extracellular water (ECW) as the main predictors, and age, sex, race, and comorbidity as covariates. Overall, 30{\%} of participants were frail. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.31 per 10 years; 95{\%}confidence interval [95{\%} CI],1.14 to 1.50), diabetes (OR, 1.65; 95{\%} CI, 1.13 to 2.40), higherfat mass (OR, 1.18; 95{\%} CI, 1.02to 1.37), and higher ECW (OR, 1.33; 95{\%} CI, 1.20 to 1.47) associated with higher odds of frailty. Higher ICW associated with lower odds of frailty (OR, 0.80 per kg; 95{\%} CI, 0.73 to 0.87). The addition of BMI data did not change the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC; AUC=0.66 versus 0.66; P=0.71), but the addition of BIS data did change the AUC (AUC=0.72; P{\textless}0.001). Thus, individual components of body composition but not BMI associate strongly with frailty in this cohort of patients receiving hemodialysis.

abstract = {The kidney has the principal role in the maintenance of acid-base balance. Therefore, a decrease in renal ammonium excretion and a positive acid balance often leading to a reduction in serum bicarbonate concentration are observed in the course of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration is usually absent until glomerular filtration rate decreases to {\textless}20 to 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, although it can develop with lesser degrees of decreased kidney function. Non-anion gap acidosis, high-anion gap acidosis, or both can be found at all stages of CKD. The acidosis can be associated with muscle wasting, bone disease, hypoalbuminemia, inflammation, progression of CKD, and increased mortality. Administration of base may decrease muscle wasting, improve bone disease, and slow the progression of CKD. Base is suggested when serum bicarbonate concentration is {\textless}22 mEq/L, but the target serum bicarbonate concentration is unclear. Evidence that increments in serum bicarbonate concentration {\textgreater} 24 mEq/L might be associated with worsening of cardiovascular disease adds complexity to treatment decisions. Further study of the mechanisms through which metabolic acidosis contributes to the progression of CKD, as well as the pathways involved in mediating the benefits and complications of base therapy, is warranted.},

abstract = {Older people constitute an increasingly greater proportion of patients with advanced CKD, including those patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment. Frailty is a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors that results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and causes vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty is common in elderly CKD patients, and it may be associated with protein-energy wasting (PEW), sarcopenia, dynapenia, and other complications of CKD. Causes of frailty with or without PEW in the elderly with CKD can be classified into three categories: causes primarily caused by aging per se, advanced CKD per se, or a combination of both conditions. Frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients are associated with impaired physical performance, disability, poorer quality of life, and reduced survival. Prevention and treatment of these conditions in the elderly CKD patients often require a multifaceted approach. Here, we examine the causes and consequences of these conditions and examine the interplay between frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between serum beta2-microglobulin (B2M) levels and frailty in an elderly Chinese population. DESIGN: A population-based cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data on 1,663 elderly participants (aged 70-84 years) from the aging arm of the Rugao Longevity and Ageing study, a population-based observational two-arm cohort study conducted in Rugao, China. MEASUREMENTS: The serum B2M was measured with chemiluminescence immunoassay by a technician in the biochemistry laboratory of the Rugao People's Hospital. Information on the frailty index and phenotype was collected. RESULTS: The mean B2M levels and frailty index were 1.8 mg/L and 0.16, respectively; 188 (11.3{\%}) participants were classified as frail (frailty phenotype). For a standard deviation increase in B2M, the adjusted odds ratio for frailty phenotype was 1.20 (95{\%} CI: 1.05, 1.39; P=0.009) and the standardized coefficient for frailty index was 0.07 (95{\%} CI: 0.02, 0.11; P=0.004). Relative to the lowest quartile, the highest B2M quartile had a greater risk of prevalent frailty with adjusted odds ratios of 1.68 (95{\%} CI: 1.04, 2.71; P=0.034) for frailty phenotype and 1.51 (95{\%} CI: 1.01, 2.27; P=0.044) for frailty index ({\textgreater}/=0.25). In addition, estimated glomerular filtration rate (based on B2M) or chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate {\textless}60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was significantly associated with frailty phenotype and index. CONCLUSION: B2M was significantly associated with both frailty phenotype and index in elderly Chinese population. The findings underscore the promising kidney relevant biomarkers for identifying vulnerable elderly Chinese population.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces frailty and worsens quality of life (QOL), even in the early stages of the disease and in young patients. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the relationship between frailty and QOL in CKD patients. Thus, we investigated this relationship in a sample of CKD patients. METHODS: A cross-observational study was conducted, in which 61 CKD patients receiving pre-dialysis treatment were assessed. All participants completed the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used valid and reliable methods to classify subjects as frail or non-frail according to Johansen's et al. (2007) criteria. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used to compare the groups. In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to measure associations between identified variables and frailty. We also performed simple linear regression using the SF-36 physical and mental composite scores. RESULTS: Almost half of the sample (42.6{\%}) exhibited evidence of frailty. The groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, and all SF-36 domains, excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Frailty was significantly associated with all SF-36 domains, again excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Regression analysis revealed no significant between-group differences in composite physical and mental health scores generated by the SF-36 (p {\textgreater}0.05). CONCLUSION: Frail and non-frail CKD patients differed significantly in seven of the eight SF-36 domains. The frail group displayed diminished physical and mental functioning when their SF-36 scores were divided by their physical and mental composite scores. Frailty was correlated with QOL domains, with the exception of the social domain. There is a need for interventions targeting the characteristics of frailty, to provide better treatment and optimize overall QOL.},

abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a cause of worsening physical functioning in older patients. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is highly reliable in older populations, but no data on older hospitalized patients with different degrees of kidney function are available. We aimed at testing the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and SPPB, either global score (range 0-12) or its individual components (muscle strength, balance, and walking speed, each ranging from 0 to 4), in a sample of older hospitalized patients. Our series consisted of 486 patients aged 65 or more consecutively enrolled in 11 acute care medical wards participating to a multicenter observational study. eGFR was obtained by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiological Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Physical performance was objectively measured by the SPPB. The relationship between eGFR and SPPB was investigated by multiple linear regression analysis. Physically impaired patients (SPPB total score{\textless}5) were older, had lower serum albumin and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores as well as higher overall co-morbidity, prevalence of stroke, cancer, and anemia compared to those with intermediate (SPPB=5-8) and good physical performance (SPPB=9-12). Fully adjusted multivariate models showed that eGFR (modeled as 10 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) intervals) was independently associated with the SPPB total score (B=0.49; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]=0.18-0.66; p=0.003), balance (B=0.30; 95{\%} CI=0.10-0.49; p=0.005), and muscle strength (B=0.06; 95{\%} CI=0.01-0.10; p=0.043), but not with walking speed (B=-0.04; 95{\%} CI=-0.09-0.11; p=0.107). In conclusion, reduced renal function is associated with poorer physical performance in older hospitalized patients. SPPB is worthy of testing to monitor changes in physical performance in elderly CKD patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty has been defined as a tool to define individuals who lack functional reserve and are at risk for functional decline. We hypothesized that chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) would be associated with a greater prevalence of frailty and disability in the elderly. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data collected from the Cardiovascular Health Study, which enrolled 5,888 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older from 4 clinical centers in the United States. Renal insufficiency is defined as a serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL or greater ({\textgreater}or =115 micromol/L) in women and 1.5 mg/dL or greater ({\textgreater}or =133 micromol/L) in men. Frailty is defined by the presence of 3 of the following abnormalities: unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, measured weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Disability is defined as any self-reported difficulty with activities of daily living. RESULTS: Among 5,808 participants with creatinine levels measured at entry, 15.9{\%} of men (n = 394) and 7.6{\%} of women (n = 254) had CRI. Prevalences of frailty (15{\%} versus 6{\%}; P {\textless}0.001) and disability (12{\%} versus 7{\%}; P = 0.001) were greater in participants with CRI compared with those with normal renal function. After multivariate adjustment for comorbidity, CRI remained significantly associated with frailty (odds ratio, 1.76; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.41), but not disability (odds ratio, 1.26; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.69). CONCLUSION: Elderly persons with CRI have a high prevalence of frailty, which may signal their risk for progression to adverse health outcomes. If confirmed in other studies, identification of frailty in patients with CRI may warrant special interventions to preserve their independence, quality of life, and survival.},

The elderly frail renal patient approaching ESRD represents a complex biologic system that is already failing. This patient phenotype exhibits progressive geriatric disabilities and dependence interspersed with shrinking periods of stability regardless of whether dialysis is started. Consequently, the frail renal patient faces challenging treatment choices underpinned by ethical tensions. Identifying the advanced frail renal patient and optimizing the shared decision-making process will enable him or her to make well informed choices based on an understanding of his or her overall condition and personal values and preferences.

The objective of this study was to describe the baseline physical function in older adults with renal failure referred for transplantation and compare them with older adults with other significant comorbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, {\&} MEASUREMENTS: An observational sample comparing physical performance in renal transplant candidates over age 60 (Renal Failure) to older people with diastolic heart failure (Heart Failure), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or at high risk for cardiovascular disease (High CV Risk) was studied. RESULTS: Older people with Renal Failure were significantly impaired by objective measures of physical function, including lower Short Physical Performance Battery, slower gait speed, and lower grip strength. CONCLUSIONS: Older people referred for renal transplantation had poorer physical performance than older adults with other common chronic diseases and may be at high risk for disability while awaiting transplantation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess whether chronic kidney disease (CKD) is independently associated with incident physical-function limitation. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Two sites: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Memphis, Tennessee. PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand one hundred thirty-five men and women aged 70 to 79 without functional limitation at baseline from the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study. MEASUREMENTS: Functional limitation was defined as difficulty in walking one-quarter of a mile or climbing 10 steps on two consecutive reports 6 months apart (in the same function). Kidney function was measured using serum cystatin C. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula ({\textless}60 versus {\textgreater}or =60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)), was a secondary predictor. Muscle strength, lean body mass according to dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, comorbidity, medication use, and inflammatory markers were evaluated as covariates. RESULTS: Persons in the highest ({\textgreater}or =1.13 mg/L) quartile of cystatin C experienced a significantly higher risk of developing functional limitation than those in the lowest ({\textless}0.86 mg/L) quartile (hazard ratio (HR)=1.70, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI)=1.40-2.07). The association between the fourth cystatin C quartile and functional limitation remained after adjustment for demographics, lean body mass, comorbidity, muscle strength, and gait speed (HR=1.41, 95{\%} CI=1.13-1.75), although the association was attenuated after adjustment for markers of inflammation (HR=1.15, 95{\%} CI=0.90-1.46). Similar results were found for eGFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), although the association with functional limitation remained after adjustment for inflammatory markers (HR=1.30, 95{\%} CI=1.08-1.56). CONCLUSION: CKD is associated with the development of functional impairment independent of comorbidity, body composition, and tests of strength and physical performance. The mechanism may be related to a heightened inflammatory state in CKD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of falls, with subsequent complications including fractures, loss of independence, hospitalization, and institutionalization. Factors associated with falls are poorly understood in this population. We hypothesized that insights derived from studies of the elderly might apply to adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis; we focused on frailty, a phenotype of physiological decline strongly associated with falls in the elderly. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study of 95 patients undergoing hemodialysis (1/2009-3/2010), the association of frailty with future falls was explored using adjusted Poisson regression. Frailty was classified using the criteria established by Fried et al., as a combination of five components: shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed. RESULTS: Over a median 6.7-month period of longitudinal follow-up, 28.3{\%} of study participants (25.9{\%} of those under 65, 29.3{\%} of those 65 and older) experienced a fall. After adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidity, disability, number of medications, marital status, and education, frailty independently predicted a 3.09-fold (95{\%} CI: 1.38-6.90, P=0.006) higher number of falls. This relationship between frailty and falls did not differ for younger and older adults (P=0.57). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, a validated construct in the elderly, was a strong and independent predictor of falls in adults undergoing hemodialysis, regardless of age. Our results may aid in identifying frail hemodialysis patients who could be targeted for multidimensional fall prevention strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established. METHODS: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty status. RESULTS: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49 (36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of participants were frail and 43{\%} were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for eGFR {\textgreater}60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61 points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR {\textless}15 (p {\textless}0.01 for all comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p = 0.002) and eGFR {\textless}15 (OR 4.83; p {\textless}0.001) were associated with worse frailty status compared with eGFR {\textgreater}60 ml/min/1.73 m(2). CONCLUSIONS: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted interventions.},

abstract = {Needing assistance with activities of daily living (ADL) is an early indicator of functional decline and has important implications for individuals' quality of life. However, correlates of need for ADL assistance have received limited attention among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD). A multicenter cohort of 742 prevalent HD patients was assessed in 2009-2011 and classified as frail, prefrail and nonfrail by the Fried frailty index (recent unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk speed, low physical activity). Patients reported need for assistance with 4 ADL tasks and identified contributing symptoms/conditions (pain, balance, endurance, weakness, others). Nearly 1 in 5 patients needed assistance with 1 or more ADL. Multivariable analysis showed increased odds for needing ADL assistance among frail (odds ratio [OR] 11.35; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 5.50-23.41; P {\textless}0.001) and prefrail (OR 1.93; 95{\%} CI 1.01-3.68; P = 0.046) compared with non-frail patients. In addition, the odds for needing ADL assistance were lower among blacks compared with whites and were higher among patients with diabetes, lung disease, and stroke. Balance, weakness, and "other" (frequently dialysis-related) symptoms/conditions were the most frequently named reasons for ADL difficulty. In addition to interventions such as increasing physical activity that might delay or reverse the process of frailty, the immediate symptoms/conditions to which individuals attribute their ADL difficulty may have clinical relevance for developing targeted management and/or treatment approaches.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, {\&} MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24 months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during follow-up. RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change, 0.2 points per year; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity (0.6 points per year; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7 points per year; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores (-1.1 points per g/dl; 95{\%} confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition, patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction in frailty score (95{\%} confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic rate was not independently associated with frailty. CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores, with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression. RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 {\%}) were frail. Frail patients were significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower physical and mental quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of life.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty, a manifestation of unsuccessful aging, is highly prevalent in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with comorbid conditions in cross-sectional studies. Longitudinal studies investigating the progression of frailty in those with advanced non-dialysis CKD are lacking. OBJECTIVES: Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial (CanFIT). To determine the natural history, prevalence of perceived and measured frailty and its association with dialysis treatment choices and adverse outcomes in patients with advanced CKD. DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study, designed to collect data from 600 participants over 2 years. SETTING: Interprofessional non-dialysis CKD clinics at four tertiary health care centres in central Canada. PATIENTS: People with CKD stage 4 and 5 (eGFR {\textless}30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) who are not on dialysis at enrollment. MEASUREMENTS: Multiple Frailty Definitions: Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Fried Frailty Criteria, Frailty Index. Dialysis start: In-Centre Hemodialysis, Home Hemodialysis or Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes: Death, Opt-out or Lost to follow up. METHODS: We will perform physical and cognitive assessments annually. We plan to analyze the relationships between frailty, treatment choices and patient centered outcomes. RESULTS: We have recruited 217 participants in 2 centres; of these, 56 {\%} had reduced physical function at baseline, as defined by the SPPB. Risk of reduced physical function was 8 fold higher in those with diabetes after adjusting for age, gender, eGFR and comorbidities. LIMITATIONS: Referred population, use of SPPB as a measure of frailty, inter-operator variability in measurement of hand grip and gait speed, cross-sectional analysis of baseline data in the subset recruited to date. CONCLUSIONS: People with advanced CKD have a high burden of reduced physical function, especially those with diabetes. We will continue enrollment into the CanFIT study to further understand the clinical history of CKD and frailty in this population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING {\&} PARTICIPANTS: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013). PREDICTORS: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio. OUTCOME: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical activity). RESULTS: 341 (7{\%}) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30{\%}) had eGFRcr{\textless}60mL/min/1.73m(2), 2,480 (50{\%}) had eGFRcys{\textless}60mL/min/1.73m(2), and 1,006 (20{\%}) had albuminuria with albumin excretion {\textgreater}/= 30mg/g. Among frail participants, prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys{\textless}60mL/min/1.73m(2) were 45{\%} and 77{\%}, respectively. Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals with eGFRcr of 60 to {\textless}75mL/min/1.73m(2) were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR categories using eGFRcys (49{\%} to 45-{\textless}60, 32{\%} to 30-{\textless}45, and 3{\%} to {\textless}30mL/min/1.73m(2)). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking {\textgreater}/=10 classes of medications) was more common in frail individuals (54{\%} vs 38{\%} of nonfrail), including classes requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants). LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design. CONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this vulnerable population.},

abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and anemia are common conditions in the outpatient setting, but their independent and additive effects on physical capacity have not been well characterized. The association of CKD and anemia with self-reported physical function was evaluated and exercise capacity was measured in patients with coronary disease. A cross-sectional study of 954 outpatients enrolled in the Heart and Soul study was performed. CKD was defined as a measured creatinine clearance {\textless}60 ml/min, and anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level of {\textless}12g/dl. Physical function was self-assessed using the physical limitation subscale of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (0 to 100), and exercise capacity was defined as metabolic equivalent tasks achieved at peak exercise. In unadjusted analyses, CKD was associated with lower self-reported physical function (67.6 versus 74.9; P {\textless} 0.001) and lower exercise capacity (5.5 versus 7.9; P {\textless} 0.001). Similarly, anemia was associated with lower self-reported physical function (62.6 versus 74.3; P {\textless} 0.001) and exercise capacity (5.7 versus 7.5; P {\textless} 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, CKD (69.4 versus 74.2; P = 0.003) and anemia (67.5 versus 73.6; P = 0.009) each remained associated with lower mean self-reported physical function. In addition, patients with CKD (6.3 versus 7.7; P {\textless} 0.001) or anemia (6.5 versus 7.4; P = 0.004) had lower adjusted mean exercise capacities. Participants with both CKD and anemia had lower self-reported physical function and exercise capacity than those with either alone. CKD and anemia are independently associated with physical limitation and reduced exercise capacity in outpatients with coronary disease, and these effects are additive. The broad impact of these disease conditions merits further study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of serum creatinine to estimate GFR may lead to underestimation of the association between self-reported frailty and kidney function. Our objectives were to evaluate the association of measured GFR (mGFR) with self-reported frailty among patients with CKD and to determine whether self-reported frailty was associated with death after adjusting for mGFR. METHODS: Participants in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (1989-1993) had GFR measured using iothalamate clearance (mGFR), and GFR was estimated based on the CKD-EPI creatinine (eGFRcr) and cystatin C (eGFRcys) equations. We defined self-reported frailty as three or more of: exhaustion, poor physical function, low physical activity, and low body weight. Death was ascertained through 2007 using the National Death Index and the United States Renal Data System. RESULTS: Eight hundred twelve MDRD participants (97 {\%}) had complete data on self-reported frailty (16 {\%} prevalence, N = 130) and mGFR (mean (SD) 33.1 +/- 11.7 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Higher GFR was associated with lower odds of self-reported frailty based on mGFR, (OR 0.71, 95 {\%} CI 0.60-0.86 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), eGFRcr (OR 0.80, 95 {\%} CI 0.67-0.94 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), and eGFRcys (OR 0.75, 95 {\%} CI 0.62-0.90 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Median follow-up was 17 (IQR 11-18) years, with 371 deaths. Self-reported frailty was associated with a higher risk of death (HR 1.71, 95 {\%} CI 1.26-2.30), which was attenuated to a similar degree when mGFR (HR 1.48, 95 {\%} CI 1.08-2.00), eGFRcr (HR 1.57, 95 {\%} CI 1.15-2.10), or eGFRcys (HR 1.51, 95 {\%} CI 1.10-2.10) was included as an indicator of kidney function. CONCLUSIONS: We found an inverse association between kidney function and self-reported frailty that was similar for mGFR, eGFR and eGFRcys. In this relatively healthy cohort of clinical trial participants with CKD, using serum creatinine to estimate GFR did not substantially alter the association of GFR with self-reported frailty or of self-reported frailty with death.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty increases early hospital readmission and mortality risk among kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. Although frailty represents a high-risk state for this population, the correlates of frailty, the patterns of the 5 frailty components, and the risk associated with these patterns are unclear. METHODS: Six hundred sixty-three KT recipients were enrolled in a cohort study of frailty in transplantation (12/2008-8/2015). Frailty, activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) disability, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale depression, education, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were measured. We used multinomial regression to identify frailty correlates. We identified which patterns of the 5 components were associated with mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 19.5{\%}. Older recipients (adjusted prevalence ratio [PR], 2.22; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.07) were more likely to be frail. The only other factors that were independently associated with frailty were IADL disability (PR, 3.22; 95{\%} CI, 1.72-6.06), depressive symptoms (PR, 11.31; 95{\%} CI, 4.02-31.82), less than a high school education (PR, 3.10; 95{\%} CI, 1.30-7.36), and low HRQOL (fair/poor: PR, 3.71; 95{\%} CI, 1.48-9.31). The most common pattern was poor grip strength, low physical activity, and slowed walk speed (19.4{\%}). Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged as having an association with post-KT mortality. KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed walking speed (hazards ratio = 2.43; 95{\%} CI, 1.17-5.03) and poor grip strength, exhaustion, and slowed walking speed (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95{\%} CI, 1.14-5.97) were at increased mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty among KT recipients; however, factors rarely measured as part of clinical practice, namely, HRQOL, IADL disability, and depressive symptoms, were significant correlates of frailty. Redefining the frailty phenotype may be needed to improve risk stratification for KT recipients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To quantify the prevalence of frailty in adults of all ages undergoing chronic hemodialysis, its relationship to comorbidity and disability, and its association with adverse outcomes of mortality and hospitalization. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Single hemodialysis center in Baltimore, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-six individuals undergoing hemodialysis enrolled between January 2009 and March 2010 and followed through August 2012. MEASUREMENTS: Frailty, comorbidity, and disability on enrollment in the study and subsequent mortality and hospitalizations. RESULTS: At enrollment, 50.0{\%} of older ({\textgreater}/= 65) and 35.4{\%} of younger ({\textless}65) individuals undergoing hemodialysis were frail; 35.9{\%} and 29.3{\%}, respectively, were intermediately frail. Three-year mortality was 16.2{\%} for nonfrail, 34.4{\%} for intermediately frail, and 40.2{\%} for frail participants. Intermediate frailty and frailty were associated with a 2.7 times (95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-7.07, P = .046) and 2.6 times (95{\%} CI = 1.04-6.49, P = .04) greater risk of death independent of age, sex, comorbidity, and disability. In the year after enrollment, median number of hospitalizations was 1 (interquartile range 0-3). The proportion with two or more hospitalizations was 28.2{\%} for nonfrail, 25.5{\%} for intermediately frail, and 42.6{\%} for frail participants. Although intermediate frailty was not associated with number of hospitalizations (relative risk = 0.76, 95{\%} CI = 0.49-1.16, P = .21), frailty was associated with 1.4 times (95{\%} CI = 1.00-2.03, P = .049) more hospitalizations independent of age, sex, comorbidity, and disability. The association between frailty and mortality (interaction P = .64) and hospitalizations (P = .14) did not differ between older and younger participants. CONCLUSIONS: Adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis have a high prevalence of frailty, more than five times as high as community-dwelling older adults. In this population, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent predictor of mortality and number of hospitalizations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING {\&} PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) {\textless}90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study. OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy. MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was 51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0{\%}) was twice that of the much older non-CKD reference population (P {\textless} 0.01). The most common frailty components were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes, eGFR(cys) categories of {\textless}30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a 2.8- (95{\%} CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of frailty compared with GFR(cys) {\textgreater}/=60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was associated with an estimated 2.5 (95{\%} CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or dialysis therapy. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal relationships between CKD and frailty. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients with pre-dialysis CKD. METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385 patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial. Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of {\textless}/=24. We determined the prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages G4-G5, not on dialysis. RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61{\%}) with CKD stages G4-G5 had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function (p {\textless} 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes deserves further study.},

@article{Bao2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between earlier dialysis initiation and mortality. METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization. RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73{\%}. In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95{\%} CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P {\textless} .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95{\%} CI, 1.25-1.97]; P {\textless} .001) and time to first hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95{\%} CI, 1.09-1.45]; P {\textless} .001). While higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95{\%} CI, 1.02-1.23] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95{\%} CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11). CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation. Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.},

@article{Wilhelm-Leen2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the association between frailty and chronic kidney disease. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8{\%}. However, among persons with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate {\textless} 45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9{\%} were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection remain elusive.},
