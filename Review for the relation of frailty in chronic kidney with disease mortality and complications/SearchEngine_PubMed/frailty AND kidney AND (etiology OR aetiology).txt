Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is rare and characterized endoscopically by
distal esophageal ulceration, blackening, and necrosis. It typically arises in
patients with multiple comorbidities who have significant systemic disease and
frailty. Specific precipitating events are variable. Evidence suggests a
multifactorial etiology likely involving esophageal ischemia in the setting of
corrosive injury from gastric contents and impaired tissue repair mechanisms. In 
the transplant setting, immunosuppression likely plays a substantial role. We
report a case of AEN in a 70-year-old man following a renal transplant.

Under normal conditions, inflammation is a protective and physiological response 
to various harmful stimuli. However, in several chronic debilitating disorders,
such as chronic kidney disease, inflammation becomes maladaptive, uncontrolled
and persistent. Systemic persistent inflammation has, for almost 20 years, been
recognized as a major contributor to the uraemic phenotype (such as
cardiovascular disease, protein energy wasting, depression, osteoporosis and
frailty), and a predictor of cardiovascular and total mortality. Since
inflammation is mechanistically related to several ageing processes
(inflammageing), it may be a major driver of a progeric phenotype in the uraemic 
milieu. Inflammation is likely the consequence of a multifactorial aetiology and 
interacts with a number of factors that emerge when uraemic toxins accumulate.
Beside interventions aiming to decrease the production of inflammatory molecules 
in the uraemic milieu, novel strategies to increase the removal of large middle
molecules, such as expanded haemodialysis, may be an opportunity to decrease the 
inflammatory allostatic load associated with retention of middle molecular weight
uraemic toxins.

Immunosuppression may occur for a number of reasons related to an individual's
frailty, debility, disease or from therapeutic iatrogenic intervention or
misadventure. A large percentage of morbidity and mortality in immunodeficient
populations is related to an inadequate response to infectious agents with slow
response to antibiotics, enhancements of antibiotic resistance in populations,
and markedly increased prevalence of acute inflammatory response, septic and
infection related death. Given known relationships between intracellular calcium 
ion concentrations and cytotoxicity and cellular death, we looked at currently
available data linking blockade of calcium ion channels and potential decrease in
expression of sepsis among immunosuppressed patients. Notable are relationships
between calcium, calcium channel, vitamin D mechanisms associated with sepsis and
demonstration of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that may utilize channels
sensitive to calcium channel blocker. We note that sepsis shock syndrome
represents loss of regulation of inflammatory response to infection and that
vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor, and klotho interact
with sepsis defense mechanisms in which movement of calcium and phosphorus are
part of the process. Given these observations we consider that further
investigation of the effect of relatively inexpensive calcium channel blockade
agents of infections in immunosuppressed populations might be worthwhile.

A comprehensive literature review of iron status in the elderly was undertaken in
order to update a previous review (Fairweather-Tait et al, 2014); 138 summarised 
papers describe research on the magnitude of the problem, aetiology and
age-related physiological changes that may affect iron status, novel strategies
for assessing iron status with concurrent health conditions, hepcidin, lifestyle 
factors, iron supplements, iron status and health outcomes (bone mineral density,
frailty, inflammatory bowel disease, kidney failure, cancer, cardiovascular, and 
neurodegenerative diseases). Each section of this review concludes with key
points from the relevant papers. The overall findings were that disturbed iron
metabolism plays a major role in a large number of conditions associated with old
age. Correction of iron deficiency/overload may improve disease prognosis, but
diagnosis of iron deficiency requires appropriate cut-offs for biomarkers of iron
status in elderly men and women to be agreed. Iron deficiency (with or without
anemia), anemia of inflammation, and anemia of chronic disease are all widespread
in the elderly and, once identified, should be investigated further as they are
often indicative of underlying disease. Management options should be reviewed and
updated, and novel therapies, which show potential for treating anemia of
inflammation or chronic disease, should be considered.

Depression and Physical Frailty Have Additive Effect on the Nutritional Status
and Clinical Outcome of Chinese Peritoneal Dialysis.

Szeto CC, Chan GC, Ng JK, Chow KM, Kwan BC, Cheng PM, Kwong VW, Law MC, Leung CB,
Li PK.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frailty and depression both contribute to malnutrition and
adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, their
interaction is incompletely defined.
METHODS: We studied 178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed 
by a validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by the
Geriatric Depression Scale; nutritional status was determined by subjective
global assessment (SGA) and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS). All patients
were followed for up to 24 months for survival and hospitalization analysis.
RESULTS: There were 111 patients (62.4%) physically frail, amongst those 48
(43.2%) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without
frailty. There was an additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty
on nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty, frail but no depressive
symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin decreased in a
stepwise manner (35.8 ± 5.6, 34.9 ± 4.4, and 32.9 ± 5.3 g/L, respectively,
p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 ± 0.61, 5.41 ± 0.59, and 5.04 ± 0.77,
respectively (p< 0.0001), and MIS was 5.12 ± 2.30, 7.13 ± 3.22, and 9.48 ± 3.97, 
respectively (p< 0.0001). At 24 months, patient survival was 86.6%, 71.4%, and
62.5% for patients with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail
with depressive symptoms, respective (p=0.001). The median number of hospital
stay was 8.04 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.91 - 19.42), 14.05 (IQR 3.57 -
37.27), and 26.62 (IQR 10.65 - 61.18) days per year of follow up, respectively
(p< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Physical frailty and depressive symptoms are both common in Chinese
PD patients, and they have additive adverse effect on the nutritional status and 
clinical outcome.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cognitive and renal impairment are pervasive among elderly
frails, a high-risk, geriatric sub-population with peculiar clinical
characteristics. In a series of frail individuals with non-advanced chronic
kidney disease (CKD), we aimed at assessing the entity of functional, general
health and cognitive impairment and the possible relationship between these types
of dysfunction and the severity of renal impairment.
METHODS: 2229 geriatric subjects were screened for frailty and CKD. Severity of
CKD was assessed by eGFR (CKD-EPI formula). Frailty was established by the Fried 
Index. Functional, general health and cognitive status were assessed by validated
score measures.
RESULTS: Final analysis included 271 frail CKD subjects (162 women, 109 men).
Mean eGFR was 64.25 ± 25.04 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD
(stage 3-4) was 44%. Twenty-six percent of patients had severe cognitive
impairment, while mild and moderate impairment was found in 7 and 67% of
individuals, respectively. All subjects had poor functional and general health
status. Cognitive capacities significantly decreased across CKD stages (p for
trend < 0.0001). In fully adjusted multivariate analyses, cognitive status
remained an independent predictor of eGFR (β = 0.465; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mild-to-moderate CKD is highly pervasive among frail elderly
individuals and the severity of renal dysfunction is independently correlated
with that of cognitive impairment. Future studies are advocated to clarify
whether the combination of kidney and mental dysfunction may portend a higher
risk of worsen outcomes in this high-risk population.

BACKGROUND: Symptomatic aortic stenosis has a poor prognosis. Many patients are
considered inoperable or at high surgical risk for surgical aortic valve
replacement (SAVR), reflecting their age, comorbidities and frailty. The clinical
effectiveness and safety of TAVI have not been reviewed systematically for these 
high levels of surgical risk. This systematic review compares mortality and other
important clinical outcomes up to 5 years post treatment following TAVI or other 
treatment in these risk groups.
METHODS: A systematic review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database
(CRD42016048396). The Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination
Databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ZETOC were searched from January 2002 to August
2016. Clinical trials or matched studies comparing TAVI with other treatments for
AS in patients surgically inoperable or operable at a high risk were included.
Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by two reviewers. Data were
pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The main outcomes were all-cause
mortality, efficacy and major complications.
RESULTS: Three good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included.
Patients' mean age ranged from 83-85 years, around half were female and New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV ranged from 83.8% to 94.2%
with frequent comorbidities. In 358 surgically inoperable patients from one RCT, 
TAVI was superior to medical therapy for all-cause mortality at 1 year (hazard
ratio (HR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.92), 2 years (HR 0.50, 95%
CI 0.39-0.65), 3 years (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41to 0.68) and 5 years (HR 0.50, 95% CI
0.39-0.65), and NYHA class III or IV at 2 years (TAVI 16.8% (16/95), medical
therapy 57.5% (23/40), p<0.001), quality of life and re-hospitalisation. TAVI had
higher risks of major bleeding up to 1 year, of stroke up to 3 years (at one year
11.2% versus 5.5%, p = .06; HR at 2 years 2.79, 95% CI 1.25-6.22; HR at 3 years
2.81; 95% CI 1.26-6.26) and of major vascular complication at 3 years (HR 8.27,
95% CI 2.92-23.44). Using the GRADE tool, this evidence was considered to be of
moderate quality. In a meta-analysis including 1,494 high risk surgically
operable patients from two non-inferiority RCTs TAVI showed no significant
differences from SAVR in all-cause mortality at two years (HR 1.03, 95% CI
0.82-1.29) and up to 5 years (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.83-1.12). There were no
statistically significant differences in major vascular complications and
myocardial infarction at any time point, discrepant results for major bleeding on
variable definitions and no differences in stroke rate at any time point. Using
the GRADE tool, this evidence was considered of low quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic aortic stenosis can be lethal without intervention but
surgical resection is contraindicated for some patients and high risk for others.
We found that all-cause mortality up to 5 years of follow-up did not differ
significantly between TAVI and SAVR in patients surgically operable at a high
risk, but favoured TAVI over medical therapy in patients surgically inoperable.
TAVI is a viable life-extending treatment option in these surgical high risk
groups.

A low-protein diet (LPD) can be expected to retard renal function decline in
advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including diabetic kidney
disease (DKD), and is recommended in a clinical setting. Regarding the molecular 
mechanisms of an LPD against DKD, previous animal studies have shown that an LPD 
exerts reno-protection through mainly the improvement of glomerular
hyperfiltration/hypertension due to the reduction of intraglomerular pressure. On
the other hand, we have demonstrated that an LPD, particularly a very-LPD (VLPD),
improved tubulo-interstitial damage, inflammation and fibrosis, through the
restoration of autophagy via the reduction of a mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in type 2 diabetes and obesity animal models. Thus,
based on animal studies, a VLPD may show a more beneficial effect against
advanced DKD. Previous clinical reports have also shown that a VLPD, not a
moderate LPD, slows the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with chronic
glomerular nephritis. However, there is insufficient clinical data regarding the 
beneficial effects of a VLPD against DKD. Additionally, the patients with CKD,
including DKD, are a high-risk group for malnutrition, such as protein⁻energy
wasting (PEW), sarcopenia, and frailty. Therefore, an LPD, including a VLPD,
should be prescribed to patients when the benefits of an LPD outweigh the risks, 
upon consideration of adherence, age, and nutritional status. As the future
predicts, the development of a VLPD replacement therapy without malnutrition may 
be expected for reno-protection against the advanced stages of DKD, through the
regulation of mTORC1 activity and adequate autophagy induction. However, further 
studies to elucidate detailed mechanisms by which a VLPD exerts reno-protection
are necessary.

Before the percutaneous era, the mortality rate of patients with coronary heart
disease not suitable for cardiac surgery was extremely high. This limit has been 
progressively exceeded with the advent of minimally invasive approaches, which,
although initially intended exclusively for low risk scenarios, was then employed
in complex patients often too compromised to undergo cardiac surgery. We are
currently witnessing, however, a sudden expansion in percutaneous coronary
interventions (PCI) in extreme cases, perceived as high-risk by operators,
imposing an important burden of human and economic resources on interventional
cardiology as a whole. In this review, the literature regarding the current
definition of high-risk PCI and its implications has been reviewed. In summary,
all proposed definitions of high risk PCI combine features related to three main 
clinical areas: 1) patient risk factors and comorbidities (incorporating those
which preclude surgical or percutaneous revascularization such as diabetes,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, lung disease,
frailty, advanced age); 2) location of the disease and complexity of coronary
anatomy (including multi-vessel disease, left main disease, chronic total
occlusion, bifurcations); 3) hemodynamic clinical status (ventricular
dysfunction, concomitant valvular disease or unstable characteristics).
Importantly, encouraging results in terms of efficacy and gains in health status 
of PCI in (variously defined) high-risk, as compared to the low-risks patients,
are reported. Thus, treating high-risk patients is becoming increasingly
relevant, to the point that current guidelines now particularly highlight the
appropriateness of percutaneous interventions in this setting .

Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after
transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for
nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period
are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa …), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or
Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical
antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and
bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation,
pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H.
influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take
advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to 
six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many
years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial
pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of
pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in
diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney
transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with
co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome,
increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common
opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant
recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and 
Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of
immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective
therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy
should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of
diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, 
about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years.
Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive
impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly
more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial
disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a
consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a
considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without
any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with
type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into
account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life
expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals
and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically,
overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in
particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used
with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia
are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function
are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

Objectives The clinical condition of frailty is a common problem in the elderly
population. However, the relationship between peripheral artery disease and
frailty in hemodialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to
identify the relationships between peripheral artery disease and frailty in
Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods A total of 362 chronic
hemodialysis patients who regularly visited six institutions were enrolled. To
evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty phenotype adjusted for Japanese
were used. Peripheral artery disease was defined as ankle-brachial index <0.9.
Results Of 362 patients, 62 patients (17.1%) were categorized as peripheral
artery disease group and 300 patients (82.9%) as Non-peripheral artery disease
group. The prevalence of frailty in the peripheral artery disease group was
significantly higher than in the Non-peripheral artery disease group (34% vs.
18%, P = 0.0103). Non-shunt side grip strength was significantly stronger in the 
Non-peripheral artery disease group (23.6 kg vs. 17.0 kg, P < 0.0001). Thigh
circumferences were also significantly larger in the Non-peripheral artery
disease group (41.7 cm vs. 39.7 cm, P = 0.0054). A multivariate logistic
regression analysis demonstrated that the factors independently associated with
peripheral artery disease were as follows: frailty (odds ratio = 2.06, 95%
confidence interval 1.09-3.89) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 3.74, 95% 
confidence interval 2.05-6.83). Conclusions It is concluded that peripheral
artery disease is closely associated with frailty in hemodialysis patients.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcopenia and muscle weakness contribute to fragility and
limit exercise tolerance among patients with CKD. This review focuses on the role
of reduction in mitochondrial mass and function in the myopathy associated with
CKD, causes for these muscle mitochondrial abnormalities, and potential
therapeutic interventions that may improve mitochondrial biogenesis and function 
as well as skeletal muscle function and performance in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial structure, function, and
composition have been shown in both experimental models and patients with CKD. A 
significant reduction in mitochondrial respiratory function and an increase in
mitochondrial complex 1 enzyme activity has been demonstrated in the muscle
tissue of male Sprague-Dawley rats following 5/6 nephrectomy. These changes were 
associated with a substantial reduction in skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass. In
patients with CKD, in-vivo magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy show
significantly elevated resting skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and lower mean 
mitochondrial coupling ratio indicating disrupted muscle mitochondrial metabolism
and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Skeletal muscle biopsies from
patients with advanced CKD show lower mitochondrial volume density and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number than controls.
SUMMARY: Advanced CKD is associated with decreased exercise capacity, skeletal
muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. Impaired mitochondrial respiratory function,
reduced muscle mitochondrial mass, and decreased energy production in skeletal
muscle play a critical role in this 'acquired mitochondrial myopathy' of CKD. It 
is reasonable, therefore, to develop therapeutic interventions that enhance
mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as skeletal muscle function and
performance in patients with CKD.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in childhood differs from adult HCC because it is 
often associated with inherited liver disease. It is, however, unclear whether
liver transplantation (LT) for HCC in childhood with or without associated
inherited disease has a comparable outcome to adult HCC. On the basis of data
from the European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR), we aimed to investigate if
there are differences in patient and graft survival after LT for HCC between
children and adults and between patients with underlying inherited versus
noninherited liver disease, respectively. We included all 175 children who
underwent LT for HCC and were enrolled in ELTR between 1985 and 2012. Of these,
38 had an associated inherited liver disease. Adult HCC patients with (n = 79)
and without (n = 316, matched by age, sex, and LT date) inherited liver disease
served as an adult comparison population. We used multivariable piecewise Cox
regression models with shared frailty terms (for LT center) to compare patient
and graft survival between the different HCC groups. Survival analyses
demonstrated a superior longterm survival of children with inherited liver
disease when compared with children with HCC without inherited liver disease
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.90; P = 0.03) and adults with HCC with
inherited liver disease (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.06-1.25; P = 0.09). There was no
survival difference between adults with and without inherited disease (HR, 1.05; 
95% CI, 0.66-1.66; P = 0.84). In conclusion, the potential survival advantage of 
children with an HCC based on inherited disease should be acknowledged when
considering transplantation and prioritization for these patients. Further
prospective studies accounting for tumor size and extension at LT are necessary
to fully interpret our findings. Liver Transplantation 24 246-255 2018 AASLD.

BACKGROUND: Short-term prognosis, e.g. mortality at three months, has many
important implications in planning the overall management of patients,
particularly non-oncologic patients in order to avoid futile practices. The aims 
of this study were: i) to investigate the risk of three-month mortality after
discharge from internal medicine and geriatric wards of non-oncologic patients
with at least one of the following conditions: permanent bedridden status during 
the hospital stay; severely reduced kidney function; hypoalbuminemia; hospital
admissions in the previous six months; severe dementia; ii) to establish the
absolute risk difference of three-month mortality of bedridden compared to
non-bedridden patients.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study was run in 102 Italian internal medicine
and geriatric hospital wards. The sample included all patients with three-months 
follow-up data. Bedridden condition was defined as the inability to walk or stand
upright during the whole hospital stay. The following parameters were also
recorded: estimated GFR≤29mL/min/1.73m2; severe dementia; albuminemia ≪2.5g/dL;
hospital admissions in the six months before the index admission.
RESULTS: Of 3915 patients eligible for the analysis, three-month follow-up were
available for 2058, who were included in the study. Bedridden patients were 112
and the absolute risk difference of mortality at three months was 0.13 (CI 95%
0.08-0.19, p≪0.0001). Logistic regression analysis also adjusted for age, sex,
number of drugs and comorbidity index found that bedridden condition (OR 2.10, CI
95% 1.12-3.94), severely reduced kidney function (OR 2.27, CI 95% 1.22-4.21),
hospital admission in the previous six months (OR 1.96, CI 95% 1.22-3.14), severe
dementia (with total or severe physical dependence) (OR 4.16, CI 95% 2.39-7.25)
and hypoalbuminemia (OR 2.47, CI 95% 1.12-5.44) were significantly associated
with higher risk of three-month mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Bedridden status, severely reduced kidney function, recent hospital 
admissions, severe dementia and hypoalbuminemia were associated with higher risk 
of three-month mortality in non-oncologic patients after discharge from internal 
medicine and geriatric hospital wards.

Objective To determine the safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use
compared with warfarin use for the treatment of venous
thromboembolism.Design Retrospective matched cohort study conducted between 1
January 2009 and 31 March 2016.Setting Community based, using healthcare data
from six jurisdictions in Canada and the United States.Participants 59 525 adults
(12 489 DOAC users; 47 036 warfarin users) with a new diagnosis of venous
thromboembolism and a prescription for a DOAC or warfarin within 30 days of
diagnosis.Main outcome measures Outcomes included hospital admission or emergency
department visit for major bleeding and all cause mortality within 90 days after 
starting treatment. Propensity score matching and shared frailty models were used
to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of the outcomes comparing DOACs with warfarin.
Analyses were conducted independently at each site, with meta-analytical methods 
used to estimate pooled hazard ratios across sites.Results Of the 59 525
participants, 1967 (3.3%) had a major bleed and 1029 (1.7%) died over a mean
follow-up of 85.2 days. The risk of major bleeding was similar for DOAC compared 
with warfarin use (pooled hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to
1.03), with the overall direction of the association favouring DOAC use. No
difference was found in the risk of death (pooled hazard ratio 0.99, 0.84 to
1.16) for DOACs compared with warfarin use. There was no evidence of
heterogeneity across centres, between patients with and without chronic kidney
disease, across age groups, or between male and female patients.Conclusions In
this analysis of adults with incident venous thromboembolism, treatment with
DOACs, compared with warfarin, was not associated with an increased risk of major
bleeding or all cause mortality in the first 90 days of treatment.Trial
registration Clinical trials NCT02833987.

Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with higher mortality.
We aimed to identify the baseline predictors of in-hospital mortality among
elderly patients with non-valvular AF (NVAF) hospitalised for any reason.
METHODS: Observational, prospective and multicentre study was carried out on
patients with NVAF over the age of 75, who had been admitted for any acute
medical condition to Internal Medicine departments in Spain.
RESULTS: We evaluated 804 patients with a mean age of 85±5.1years, of which 53.9%
were females. During the hospitalization 10.1% (n=81) of the patients died. The
patients who died were older, had a greater percentage of institutionalization,
worse previous basic functional status (Barthel Index), worse cognitive
performance at admission and greater proportion of frailty and sarcopenia.
Logistic regression multivariate analysis identified that the strongest
determinants of in-hospital mortality were the baseline functional status
(Barthel Index) (OR for total dependency 4.73, 95% CI 2.32-9.63), and admissions 
for stroke (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.41-8.90) and acute renal failure (OR 1.93, 95% CI
1.12-3.32).
CONCLUSION: The overall in-hospital mortality of elderly patients with NVFA is
high. Among all factors evaluated in the global geriatric assessment the baseline
functional status was the strongest predictor for in-hospital mortality on this
population.

BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness is a risk factor for mortality in hemodialysis (HD)
patients. Muscle strength measurements are routinely used as a screening tool but
depend on patient cooperation and motivation. We wished to determine whether
measuring maximal voluntary muscle strength was affected by patient self-reported
distress.
METHODS: We measured pinch strength (PS) and handgrip strength (HGS) in 382 adult
HD patients with a corresponding self-reported distress thermometer (DT) scores. 
Postdialysis body composition measurements were made using multifrequency
bioelectrical assessments and patients assessed for frailty.
RESULTS: Mean age was 66.4 ± 14.9 years, with 238 males (62%), 48% diabetic, and 
dialysis vintage 36 (15-75) months. The mean DT score was 4.4 ± 3.3, with a
frailty score of 4.6 ± 1.5. On multivariable analysis, DT scores were associated 
with frailty (β = 0.35, P = .003), prescription of aspirin for cardiac disease (β
= 1.0, P = .004), lean body mass (β = 0.04, P = .004), and negatively with age (β
= -0.05, P < .001), hematocrit (β = -8.2, P = .004), and maximum PS (β = -1.4, P 
= .003).
CONCLUSION: Paradoxically higher self-reported DT scores were associated with
younger age and lean body mass. As such, younger healthier, rather than more
comorbid, patients may have greater expectations for their health and therefore
report more distress. We found no association between DT scores and HGS, and as
such, although HGS is a voluntary test, it appears to be a robust test
independent of patient stresses. However, PS was lower in patients with higher DT
scores, and as such, greater care may be required in interpreting these
measurements.

Persons living with HIV (PLWH) have accentuated risks for age-associated
comorbidities. Compared to the general population, PLWH have a 2-fold higher risk
of cardiovascular disease, a 3-fold increased risk of fracture, and a risk of
kidney disease that is comparable to that in diabetes. Some comorbidities may
present at younger ages than among the general population, suggesting the
possibility of accelerated aging with HIV infection.

OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia measured by decreased psoas muscle size has been used as a 
surrogate for frailty and correlates with adverse outcomes in both the short and 
long term after many major operations. Our aim was to evaluate this measure as a 
predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair 
(EVAR).
METHODS: Once Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, all patients who 
underwent EVAR from December 2010 to March 2016 at a Veterans Affairs hospital
were assessed for sarcopenia by total psoas muscle area (TPA) measured on axial
computed tomography scan immediately inferior to the fourth lumbar (L4) superior 
end plate. Outcomes including length of stay and mortality were collected from
the medical record.
RESULTS: There were 135 patients who underwent EVAR at a median age of 70 years. 
Median aneurysm size was 5.5 cm. Length of stay was >2 days in 25% of patients
(n = 33), with the most common reasons for delayed discharge including
respiratory complications (8.9% [n = 12]) and urinary retention (4.0% [n = 9]).
Low TPA was not associated with extended length of stay (P = .40). Patients with 
lowest tertile TPA had 42% 5-year survival compared with 93% survival observed
for the remaining two-thirds of patients (P = .01). Multivariate analysis
revealed increased likelihood of mortality at 5 years for patients in the lowest 
tertile for TPA (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.9) as well as
for patients with chronic kidney disease (odds ratio, 5.2; 95% confidence
interval, 1.5-18.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative sarcopenia does not appear to affect length of stay but
does portend worse long-term survival. This simple preoperative measurement may
help vascular surgeons tailor repair thresholds and avoid nonbeneficial
procedures.

To assess whether biopsy-guided selection of kidneys from very old brain-dead
donors enables more successful transplantations, the authors of this multicenter,
observational study compared graft survival between 37 recipients of 1 or 2
histologically evaluated kidneys from donors older than 80 years and 198
reference-recipients of non-histologically evaluated single grafts from donors
aged 60 years and younger (transplantation period: 2006-2013 at 3 Italian
centers). During a median (interquartile range) of 25 (13-42) months, 2
recipients (5.4%) and 10 reference-recipients (5.1%) required dialysis (crude and
donor age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.55
[0.34-7.12], P = .576 and 1.41 [0.10-19.54], P = .798, respectively). Shared
frailty analyses confirmed similar outcomes in a 1:2 propensity score study
comparing recipients with 74 reference-recipients matched by center, year, donor,
and recipient sex and age. Serum creatinine was similar across groups during
84-month follow-up. Recipients had remarkably shorter waiting times than did
reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (7.5 [4.0-19.5] vs 36
[19-56] and 40 [24-56] months, respectively, P < .0001 for both comparisons).
Mean (± SD) kidney donor risk index was 2.57 ± 0.32 in recipients vs 1.09 ± 0.24 
and 1.14 ± 0.24 in reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients
(P < .0001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were similar across groups.
Biopsy-guided allocation of kidneys from octogenarian donors permits further
expansion of the donor organ pool and faster access to a kidney transplant,
without increasing the risk of premature graft failure.

Dialysis in the Elderly and Impact of Institutionalization in the United States
Renal Data System.

BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that in the very elderly dialysis patients in the
United States, institutionalization in nursing homes would increase mortality in 
addition to age alone.
METHODS: Incident dialysis patients from 2001 to 2008 above the age of 70 were
included. Patients above 70 were categorized into 4 groups according to age as
70-75, 76-80, 81-85, and >85 years and further divided into institutionalized and
noninstitutionalized. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to assess patient
survival.
RESULTS: A total of 349,440 patients were identified above the age of 70 at the
time of initiation of dialysis. For institutionalized patients, the mean survival
was significantly lower, 1.71 ± 0.03 years for those in the age range 70-75, 1.44
± 0.02 years for those in the age range 76-80, 1.25 ± 0.02 years for those in the
age range 81-85, and 1.04 ± 0.02 for those in the >85 years age group (p =
0.0001). The hazard ratio for mortality in institutionalized elderly patients on 
dialysis was 1.80 ([95% CI 1.77-1.83]; p = 0.0001). After adjustment for other
variables (multivariate Cox regression), to be institutionalized was still an
independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.57 [95% CI
1.54-1.60]; p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: There was increased mortality in institutionalized elderly patients
as compared to noninstutionalized elderly patients in the same age group. In
accordance with the increased frailty and decreased benefits of therapies in the 
very elderly, especially in those with additional co-morbidities besides age,
palliative and end-of-life care should be considered.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

Renal disease is a common health condition that leads to loss of physical
function, frailty, and premature loss of independence in addition to other severe
comorbidities and increased mortality. Increased levels of physical activity and 
initiation of exercise training is recommended in the current guidelines for all 
patients with renal disease, but participation and adherence rates are low. The
barriers to exercise and physical activity in patients with renal disease are not
well defined and currently based on patient provider perception and opinion.
There have been no published reviews that have synthesized published findings on 
patient reported barriers to exercise. This integrative literature review
therefore aimed to identify the current understanding of patient reported
barriers to regular exercise. This integrative review found that patient
perceived barriers to exercise are not consistent with the barriers that have
been identified by renal disease specialists and healthcare providers, which were
disinterest, lack of motivation, and being incapable of exercise. The patient
reported barriers identified through this review were complex and diverse, and
the most frequently reported patient perceived barrier to exercise was low energy
levels and fatigue. It is clear that additional research to identify patient
perceived barriers to exercise is needed and that patient directed interventions 
to address these barriers should be developed. This integrative review provides
information to the interdisciplinary nephrology team that can be used to tailor
their assessment of barriers to exercise and provide exercise education for
patients with renal disease.

BACKGROUND: Predicting outcomes in those with chronic kidney disease or following
transplantation is challenging, and current models lack detailed patient-level
information. Frailty and poor functional status are risk factors for adverse
patient outcomes that may be useful additions to prognostic tools in patients
with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine 
whether frailty or functional status are associated with increased risk of
mortality or adverse clinical outcomes in patients with advanced kidney disease.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review to identify and evaluate
studies linking frailty and functional status with patient outcomes in
populations with advanced kidney disease. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, and the
Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials. Two reviewers will conduct all
screening and data extraction independently. A modified version of the Quality In
Prognosis Studies tool will be used to evaluate the quality of the studies. If
meta-analysis of outcome data is possible, a random effects model will be used.
DISCUSSION: The results of this review will inform the development, selection,
and validation of appropriate metrics needed to improve prognostication in
patients with chronic kidney disease.

Intentional weight loss is an important treatment option for overweight persons
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), but the effects on long-term fracture risk
are not known. The purpose of this Look AHEAD analysis was to evaluate whether
long-term intentional weight loss would increase fracture risk in overweight or
obese persons with DM. Look AHEAD is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial.
Recruitment began in August 2001 and follow-up continued for a median of 11.3
years at 16 academic centers. A total of 5145 persons aged 45 to 76 years with DM
were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) with reduced 
calorie consumption and increased physical activity designed to achieve and
maintain ≥7% weight loss or to diabetes support and education intervention (DSE).
Incident fractures were ascertained every 6 months by self-report and confirmed
with central adjudication of medical records. The baseline mean age of
participants was 59 years, 60% were women, 63% were white, and the mean BMI was
36 kg/m2 . Weight loss over the intervention period (median 9.6 years) was 6.0%
in ILI and 3.5% in DSE. A total of 731 participants had a confirmed incident
fracture (358 in DSE versus 373 in ILI). There were no statistically significant 
differences in incident total or hip fracture rates between the ILI and DSE
groups. However, compared to the DSE group, the ILI group had a statistically
significant 39% increased risk of a frailty fracture (HR 1.39; 95% CI, 1.02 to
1.89). An intensive lifestyle intervention resulting in long-term weight loss in 
overweight/obese adults with DM was not associated with an overall increased risk
of incident fracture but may be associated with an increased risk of frailty
fracture. When intentional weight loss is planned, consideration of bone
preservation and fracture prevention is warranted. © 2017 American Society for

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Technique failure is a major limitation of peritoneal 
dialysis. Our study aimed to identify center- and patient-level predictors of
peritoneal dialysis technique failure.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All patients on incident
peritoneal dialysis in Australia from 2004 to 2014 were included in the study
using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry.
Center- and patient-level characteristics associated with technique failure were 
evaluated using Cox shared frailty models. Death-censored technique failure and
cause-specific technique failure were analyzed as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: The study included 9362 patients from 51 centers in Australia. The
technique failure rate was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.36) episodes 
per patient-year, with a sevenfold variation across centers that was mainly
associated with center-level characteristics. Technique failure was significantly
less likely in centers with larger proportions of patients treated with
peritoneal dialysis (>29%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 
0.73 to 0.94) and more likely in smaller centers (<16 new patients per year;
adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.21) and centers
with lower proportions of patients achieving target baseline serum phosphate
levels (<40%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to
1.29). Similar results were observed for death-censored technique failure, except
that center target phosphate achievement was not significantly associated.
Technique failure due to infection, social reasons, mechanical causes, or death
was variably associated with center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal
dialysis, and/or target phosphate achievement, automated peritoneal dialysis
exposure, icodextrin use, and antifungal use. The variation of hazards of
technique failure across centers was reduced by 28% after adjusting for
patient-specific factors and an additional 53% after adding center-specific
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Technique failure varies widely across centers in Australia. A
significant proportion of this variation is related to potentially modifiable
center characteristics, including peritoneal dialysis center size, proportion of 
patients on peritoneal dialysis, and proportion of patients on peritoneal
dialysis achieving target phosphate level.

INTRODUCTION: This article ponders upon wearable medical measurement devices in
relation to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its' associated comorbidities - and 
whether these might benefit CKD-patients. We aimed to map the intersection(s) of 
nephrology and wearable sensor technology to help technologists understand
medical aspects, and clinicians to understand technological possibilities that
are available (or soon will become so). Areas covered: A structured literature
search on main comorbidities and complications CKD patients suffer from, was used
to steer mini-reviews on wearable sensor technologies clustered around 3 themes
being: Cardiovascular-related, diabetes-related and physical fitness/frailty.
This review excludes wearable dialysis - although also strongly enabled by
miniaturization - because that highly important theme deserves separate in-depth 
reviewing. Expert commentary: Continuous progress in integrated electronics
miniaturization enormously lowered price, size, weight and energy consumption of 
electronic sensors, processing power, memory and wireless connectivity. These
combined factors boost opportunities for wearable medical sensors. Such devices
can be regarded as enablers for: Remote monitoring, influencing human behaviour
(exercise, dietary), enhanced home care, remote consults, patient education and
peer networks. However, to make wearable medical devices succeed, the challenge
to fit them into health care structures will be dominant over the challenge to
realize the bare technologies themselves.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and
associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in
frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we
examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of
Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in 
ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24
months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled
frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during
follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of
frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores
changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change,
0.2 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity
(0.6 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7
points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher
frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores
(-1.1 points per g/dl; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition,
patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become
frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction
in frailty score (95% confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the
underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included
serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of
hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and
hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at
any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic
rate was not independently associated with frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores,
with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of 
inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening
frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or 
posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is a common condition in patients with severe aortic stenosis 
(AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The aim of this
systematic review was to assess the impact of frailty status on acute kidney
injury (AKI) and mortality after TAVR.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 
Cochrane databases from the inception through November 2016. The protocol for
this study is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42016052350). Studies that reported odds ratios,
relative risks or hazard ratios comparing the risk of AKI after TAVR in frail vs.
non-frail patients were included. Mortality risk was evaluated among the studies 
that reported AKI-related outcomes. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence
interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance
method.
RESULTS: Eight cohort studies with a total of 10,498 patients were identified and
included in the meta-analysis. The pooled RR of AKI after TAVR among the frail
patients was 1.19 (95% CI 0.97-1.46, I2 = 0), compared with non-frail patients.
When the meta-analysis was restricted only to studies with standardized AKI
diagnosis according to Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 criteria, the 
pooled RRs of AKI in frail patients was 1.16 (95% CI 0.91-1.47, I2 = 0). Within
the selected studies, frailty status was significantly associated with increased 
mortality (RR 2.01; 95% CI 1.44-2.80, I2 = 58).
CONCLUSION: The findings from our study suggest no significant association
between frailty status and AKI after TAVR. However, frailty status is associated 
with mortality after TAVR and may aid appropriate patient selection for TAVR.

BACKGROUND: Survival for patients commencing renal replacement therapy is around 
90% in the first year and 83% at two years after starting dialysis. The factors
that appear to predict mortality are comorbidity and frailty associated with
kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate, age and biochemical factors.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse the condition of patients starting renal replacement
therapy, based on biomarkers commonly used in clinical practice and their
association with mortality, measured 6 and 12 months after initiating replacement
therapy.
METHODS: A one-year prospective follow-up study with 189 patients.
Sociodemographic variables, aetiology of renal disease, comorbidities, prior
nephrology service monitoring, prior renal transplantation and biochemical
parameters at the time of initiating replacement therapy were analysed.
RESULTS: The overall percentage of death during the one-year follow-up was 6.87%,
with 64% of deaths occurring during the first six months. The only variable
independently associated with mortality was low albumin levels.
CONCLUSION: Although most patients in this centre are monitored by a nephrologist
prior to starting replacement therapy, many nevertheless fail to achieve the
biochemical targets recommended. One such parameter is albumin, which proved at
the start of replacement therapy to be an independent predictor of mortality.
Findings of this study show the need to intervene on certain biochemical
parameters during the pre-dialysis stage and at the start of dialysis, in order
to improve survival in this group of patients.

BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the
general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear
whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney failure.
METHODS: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults with
end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South
America designed to examine the association between periodontitis and all-cause
and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis.
Participants were matched 1:1 on their propensity score for moderate to severe
periodontitis assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal 
Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared
frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries.
RESULTS: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe
periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score methods to generate a
matched cohort of participants with periodontitis similar to those with none or
mild periodontal disease, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a 
lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74,
95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 
person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were
not changed substantially when participants were limited to those with 12 or more
natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes of cardiovascular death.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does not appear 
to be associated with an increased risk of early death in adults treated with
hemodialysis.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Little is known about factors that predispose older
adults to poor recovery after a stroke. In this study, we sought to evaluate
prestroke measures of frailty and related factors as markers of vulnerability to 
poor outcomes after ischemic stroke.
METHODS: In participants aged 65 to 99 years with incident ischemic strokes from 
the Cardiovascular Health Study, we evaluated the association of several risk
factors (frailty, frailty components, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and
cystatin C) assessed before stroke with stroke outcomes of survival, cognitive
decline (≥5 points on Modified Mini-Mental State Examination), and activities of 
daily living decline (increase in limitations).
RESULTS: Among 717 participants with incident ischemic stroke with survival data,
slow walking speed, low grip strength, and cystatin C were independently
associated with shorter survival. Among participants <80 years of age, frailty
and interleukin-6 were also associated with shorter survival. Among 509
participants with recovery data, slow walking speed, and low grip strength were
associated with both cognitive and activities of daily living decline poststroke.
C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were associated with poststroke cognitive
decline among men only. Frailty status was associated with activities of daily
living decline among women only.
CONCLUSIONS: Markers of physical function-walking speed and grip strength-were
consistently associated with survival and recovery after ischemic stroke.
Inflammation, kidney function, and frailty also seemed to be determinants of
survival and recovery after an ischemic stroke. These markers of vulnerability
may identify targets for differing pre and poststroke medical management and
rehabilitation among older adults at risk of poor stroke outcomes.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered a model of accelerated aging. More
specifically, CKD leads to reduced physical functioning and increased frailty,
increased vascular dysfunction, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness,
high levels of systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased 
cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence suggests that the cognitive impairment 
associated with CKD may be related to cerebral small vessel disease and overall
impairment in white matter integrity. The triad of poor physical function,
vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment places patients living with CKD at
an increased risk for loss of independence, poor health-related quality of life, 
morbidity, and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the available 
evidence of cerebrovascular-renal axis and its interconnection with early and
accelerated cognitive impairment in patients with CKD and the plausible role of
exercise as a therapeutic modality. Understanding the cerebrovascular-renal axis 
pathophysiological link and its interconnection with physical function is
important for clinicians in order to minimize the risk of loss of independence
and improve quality of life in patients with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis and
is traditionally measured using tools that assess physical impairment. Alternate 
measurement tools highlight cognitive and functional domains, requiring
clinician, patient, and/or caregiver input. In this study, we compared frailty
measures for incident dialysis patients that incorporate patient, clinician, and 
caregiver perspectives with an aim to contrast the measured prevalence of frailty
using tools derived from different conceptual frameworks.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients was conducted
between February 2014 and June 2015. Frailty was assessed at dialysis onset
using: 1) modified definition of Fried Phenotype (Dialysis Morbidity Mortality
Study definition, DMMS); 2) Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS); 3) Frailty Assessment
Care Planning Tool (provides CFS grading, FACT-CFS); and 4) Frailty Index (FI).
Measures were compared via correlation and sensitivity/specificity analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 98 patients participated (mean age of 61 ± 14 years).
Participants were primarily Caucasian (91%), male (58%), and the majority started
on hemodialysis (83%). The median score for both the CFS and FACT-CFS was 4
(interquartile range of 3-5). The mean FI score was 0.31 (standard
deviation ± 0.16). The DMMS identified 78% of patients as frail. The FACT-CFS
demonstrated highest correlation (r = 0.71) with the FI, while the DMMS was most 
sensitive (97%, 100%) and a CFS ≥ 5 most specific (100%, 77%) at corresponding FI
cutoff values (>0.21, >0.45).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessments of incident dialysis patients that include
clinician, caregiver and patient perspectives have moderate to strong correlation
with the FI. At specified FI cutoff values, the FACT-CFS and DMMS are highly
sensitive measures of frailty. The CFS and FACT-CFS may represent viable
alternative screening tools in dialysis patients.

Background: The burden of chronic kidney disease is highest among older adults
but the significance of a diminished level of kidney function in this
heterogeneous population is poorly understood. We sought to examine the
relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and objective
physical performance in older adults.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 4,562 participants from The Irish
Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a national cohort of community-dwelling adults aged
≥50 years. We used multivariable linear or quantile regression to model the
association between categories of cystatin C (eGFRcys) or creatinine eGFR
(eGFRcr) and the following outcomes: gait speed, timed-up-and-go (TUG) and grip
strength. Relationships were further explored using natural eGFR splines. We
examined effect modification by age in the relationship between eGFR and gait
speed.
Results: Mean (SD) age was 61.8 (8.3) years, 53.6% were female and median (IQR)
eGFRcys was 82 (70-94) mL/min/1.73m2. In multivariable-adjusted models,
participants in the lowest eGFRcys category (< 45 mL/min/1.73m2) had 3.32 cm/s
(95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.02-6.62) slower mean gait speed, 1.32 kg
(95%CI 0.20-2.44) lower mean grip strength, and 0.31 seconds (95% CI -0.04 to
0.65) longer median TUG versus the reference group (eGFRcys ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2). 
The relationship between eGFRcys and outcomes appeared linear but varied by age. 
The association between eGFRcr and outcomes tended towards a U-shape.
Conclusions: Cystatin C eGFR was linearly related to poorer physical performance 
beyond middle age among community-dwelling adults. The non-linear relationships
observed with eGFRcr underscore the limitations of creatinine as a predictor of
frailty outcomes in older individuals.

Aging and Alzheimer is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study involving 2944
adults aged ≥65 years from selected areas in Cuba's Havana and Matanzas
Provinces. This door-to-door study, which began in 2003, includes periodic
assessments of the cohort based on an interview; physical exam; anthropometric
measurements; and diagnosis of dementia and its subtypes, other mental disorders,
and other chronic non-communicable diseases and their risk factors. Information
was gathered on sociodemographic characteristics; disability, dependency and
frailty; use of health services; and characteristics of care and caregiver
burden. The first assessment also included blood tests: complete blood count,
blood glucose, kidney and liver function, lipid profile and ApoE4 genotype (a
susceptibility marker). In 2007-2011, the second assessment was done of 2010
study subjects aged ≥65 years who were still alive. The study provides data on
prevalence and incidence of dementia and its risk factors, and of related
conditions that affect the health of older adults. It also contributes valuable
experiences from field work and interactions with older adults and their
families. Building on lessons learned, a third assessment to be done in 2016-2018
will incorporate a community intervention strategy to respond to diseases and
conditions that predispose to dementia, frailty and dependency in older adults.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review sarcopenia in chronic kidney
disease (CKD). We aim to present how definitions of sarcopenia from the general
population may pertain to those with CKD, its assessment by clinicians and
emerging therapies for sarcopenia in CKD. For this review, we limit our
description and recommendations to patients with CKD who are not on dialysis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Poorer parameters of lean mass, strength and physical function
are associated with worsening patient-centered outcomes such as limiting
mobility, falls and mortality in CKD; however, the magnitude of these
associations are different in those with and without CKD. Sarcopenia in CKD is a 
balance between skeletal muscle regeneration and catabolism, which are both
altered in the uremic environment. Multiple pathways are involved in these
derangements, which are briefly reviewed. Differences between commonly used terms
cachexia, frailty, protein-energy wasting, dynapenia and sarcopenia are
described. Therapeutic options in predialysis CKD are not well studied;
therefore, we review exercise options and emerging pharmacological therapies.
SUMMARY: Sarcopenia, now with its own International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision (ICD-10) code, is of importance clinically and should be accounted 
for in research studies in patients with CKD. Multiple therapies for sarcopenia
are in development and will hopefully be available for our patients in the
future.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether higher serum β2 -microglobulin (B2M) levels, a
kidney function marker, are associated with prevalent and incident frailty in
community-dwelling older women.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of a prospective cohort.
SETTING: Population-based cohort study in Tokyo, Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling women aged 75 and older with adequate data for
assessing frailty status (N = 1,191) and a subset of participants without
baseline frailty but with repeated frailty assessment at 2 and 4 years of
follow-up.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary predictor was B2M level. Outcomes were prevalent and
incident frailty during the 4-year follow-up period. Frailty was defined as
presence of three of the five Fried criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, 
slowness, and low physical activity. Adjusted odds ratios for the main
confounders were obtained using logistic regression. Discrete-time Cox
proportional hazards models were used to determine the risk of developing
frailty.
RESULTS: The study included 241 (20.2%) women with prevalent frailty at baseline 
and 139 (21.1%) with incident frailty during the 4-year follow-up. On
multivariate analysis adjusted for multiple potential confounders, the odds of
prevalent frailty were 2.5 times as great with B2M levels of 1.9 to 2.1 mg/L as
with levels less than 1.6 mg/L and 2.0 times as great with B2M levels of 2.2 mg/L
or more. In the unadjusted model, B2M levels of 1.9 to 2.1 mg/L were associated
with a greater incidence of frailty than B2M levels of less than 1.6 mg/L (hazard
ratio = 1.72, 95% confidence interval = 1.04-2.86). In the multivariate analysis 
adjusted for potential confounders, no significant association was noted between 
the highest B2M quartile and incident frailty.
CONCLUSION: Higher B2M levels were independently associated with greater frailty 
at baseline in older adults but only slightly associated with greater risk of
incident frailty over 4 years of follow-up.

Hypoalbuminemia, a frailty criterion, belongs to a group of co-morbidities not
captured as a traditional risk factor. We assessed its prognostic value in
patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The study 
included 1,215 consecutive patients from the Optimized Catheter Valvular
Intervention -TAVI Japanese multicenter registry. Hypoalbuminemia was defined as 
serum albumin level <3.5 g/dl. Baseline characteristics, procedural outcomes, and
all-cause, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality rates after TAVI were
compared between patients with albumin level <3.5 g/dl (hypo[h]-ALB group, n =
284) and those with albumin level >3.5 g/dl (nonhypo[nh]-ALB group, n = 931).
Several baseline characteristics differed significantly between both groups,
including age (85.1 ± 5.1 vs 84.2 ± 4.9 years, p = 0.012), ejection fraction
(58.5 ± 14.3% vs 62.9 ± 12.4%, p <0.001), baseline kidney function, or liver
disease. The 30-day mortality rate in all patients showed significant differences
between the 2 groups (3.9% vs 1.3%, p = 0.005). During a mean follow-up of
330 days, cumulative all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality
rates were significantly higher in the hALB group than in the nhALB group
(log-rank test, p <0.001, p = 0.0021, and p <0.001, respectively). The groups
were also analyzed using a propensity matching model for adjusting the baseline
differences. The analysis revealed that the poorer prognosis of the hALB group in
terms of cumulative all-cause and noncardiovascular mortality was retained (p =
0.038, and p = 0.0068, respectively); however, differences in cardiovascular
mortality rates in the 2 groups were attenuated (p = 0.93). In conclusion,
hypoalbuminemia was associated with poor prognosis, highlighted by the increase
in noncardiovascular mortality. Baseline albumin level could be a useful marker
for risk stratification before TAVI.

PURPOSE: Frailty and functional status have emerged as significant predictors of 
morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing cancer surgery. To articulate the
impact on value (ie quality per cost), we compared perioperative outcomes and
expenditures according to patient function for older adults undergoing kidney
cancer surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using linked SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
Results)-Medicare data, we identified 19,129 elderly patients with kidney cancer 
treated with nonablative surgery from 2000 to 2009. We quantified patient
function using function related indicators (claims indicative of dysfunction and 
disability) and measured 30-day morbidity, mortality, resource use and cost.
Using multivariable, mixed effects models to adjust for patient and hospital
characteristics, we estimated the relationship of patient functionality with both
treatment outcomes and expenditures.
RESULTS: Of 19,129 patients we identified 5,509 (28.8%) and 3,127 (16.4%) with a 
function related indicator count of 1 and 2 or greater, respectively. While
surgical complications did not vary (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86-1.05), patients with 2 
or more indicators more often experienced a medical event (OR 1.22, 95% CI
1.10-1.36) or a geriatric event (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.33-1.81), or died within 30
days of surgery (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.10-1.86) compared with patients with no
baseline dysfunction. These patients utilized significantly more medical
resources and amassed higher acute care expenditures (p <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: During kidney cancer surgery, patients in poor functional health can
face a more eventful medical recovery at elevated cost, indicating lower value
care. Greater consideration of frailty and functional status during treatment
planning and transitions may represent areas for value enhancement in kidney
cancer and urology care.

BACKGROUND: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including 
adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key
consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures
of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with
complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013).
PREDICTORS: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated
using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine
albumin-creatinine ratio.
OUTCOME: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty
characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical
activity).
RESULTS: 341 (7%) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30%) had
eGFRcr<60mL/min/1.73m2, 2,480 (50%) had eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2, and 1,006 (20%) 
had albuminuria with albumin excretion ≥ 30mg/g. Among frail participants,
prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2 were 45% and 77%, respectively.
Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a 
strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals
with eGFRcr of 60 to <75mL/min/1.73m2 were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR 
categories using eGFRcys (49% to 45-<60, 32% to 30-<45, and 3%
to <30mL/min/1.73m2). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking ≥10 classes of medications) was
more common in frail individuals (54% vs 38% of nonfrail), including classes
requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent
complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants).
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, 
with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys
versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic
kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative
biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this
vulnerable population.

Joint Model for Mortality and Hospitalization.

Chen Y, Guo W, Kotanko P, Usvyat L, Wang Y.

Modeling hospitalization is complicated because the follow-up time can be
censored due to death. In this paper, we propose a shared frailty joint model for
survival time and hospitalization. A random effect semi-parametric proportional
hazard model is assumed for the survival time and conditional on the follow-up
time, hospital admissions or total length of stay is modeled by a generalized
linear model with a nonparametric offset function of the follow-up time. We
assume that the hospitalization and the survival time are correlated through a
latent subject-specific random frailty. The proposed model can be implemented
using existing software such as SAS Proc NLMIXED. We demonstrate the feasibility 
through simulations. We apply our methods to study hospital admissions and total 
length of stay in a cohort of patients on hemodialysis. We identify age, albumin,
neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and vintage as significant risk factors for 
mortality, and age, gender, race, albumin, NLR, pre-dialysis systolic blood
pressure (preSBP), interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) and equilibrated Kt/V (eKt/V)
as significant risk factors for both hospital admissions and total length of
stay. In addition, hospitalization admissions is positively associated with
vintage.

The scope of this article is to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors
associated with the frailty of elderly people with chronic kidney disease on
hemodialysis. This involved a correlational, cross-sectional study conducted in a
dialysis center in the state of São Paulo. The sample consisted of 60
participants. The Participant Characterization Instrument was used for extracting
sociodemographic and clinical data and the Edmonton Frail Scale was used to
evaluate the level of frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
identify the factors associated with frailty. The mean age of the 60 patients
included was 71.1 (± 6.9) years, predominantly male (70%), of which 36.7% were
classified as frail. With respect to the factors associated with frailty among
the variables of gender, age, self-reported skin color, schooling, monthly per
capita income, hemodialysis time, number of associated diseases, falls in the
year, hematocrit level, parathyroid hormone and use of calcitriol, it was found
that only the monthly per capita income was significantly associated with frailty
(OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.1-0.9; p = 0.04). There was an association between frailty
and income, showing that the elderly most at risk of frailty were those with
lower income.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older
adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive
impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of
life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in
increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in
hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients 
with pre-dialysis CKD.
METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385
patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated 
tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive
frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial.
Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of ≤24. We determined the
prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages 
G4-G5, not on dialysis.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5
had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control
group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most
pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function 
(p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of
stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment
in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects
of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of
cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes
deserves further study.

AIM: To investigate associations between clinical parameters - beyond the evident
physiological deterioration and limitations of medical treatment - with
in-hospital death for patients receiving Rapid Response System (RRS) attendances.
METHODS: Retrospective case-control analysis of clinical parameters for 328
patients aged 60 years and above at their last RRS call during admission to a
single teaching hospital in the 2012-2013 calendar years. Generalised estimating 
equation modelling was used to compare the deceased with a randomly selected
sample of those who had RRS calls and survived admission (controls), matched by
age group, sex, and hospital ward.
RESULTS: In addition to a pre-existing order for limitation of treatment or
cardiac arrest (OR 6.92; 95%CI 4.61-10.27), nursing home residence, proteinuria, 
advanced malignancy, acute myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease,
cognitive impairment and frailty were associated with high risk of death. After
adjusting for all the clinical indicators investigated, the strongest risk
factors for in-hospital death for patients with a RRS call were advanced
malignancy (OR 3.95; 95%CI 2.16-7.21) and new myocardial infarction (OR 2.79;
95%CI 1.86-4.20). Patients with cognitive impairment, frailty indicator or
chronic kidney disease were twice as likely to die as patients without those risk
factors.
CONCLUSION: In a sample of older deteriorated patients requiring a RRS
attendance, multiple indicators of chronic illness, cognitive impairment and
frailty were significantly associated with high risk of death. These clinical
features beyond the evident orders for limitation of medical treatment should
signal the need for clinicians to initiate end-of-life discussions that may
prevent futile interventions.

BACKGROUND: Frailty increases early hospital readmission and mortality risk among
kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. Although frailty represents a high-risk
state for this population, the correlates of frailty, the patterns of the 5
frailty components, and the risk associated with these patterns are unclear.
METHODS: Six hundred sixty-three KT recipients were enrolled in a cohort study of
frailty in transplantation (12/2008-8/2015). Frailty, activities of daily living 
(ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) disability, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale depression, education, and health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) were measured. We used multinomial regression to identify frailty
correlates. We identified which patterns of the 5 components were associated with
mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 19.5%. Older recipients (adjusted prevalence
ratio [PR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.07) were more likely to be
frail. The only other factors that were independently associated with frailty
were IADL disability (PR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.72-6.06), depressive symptoms (PR,
11.31; 95% CI, 4.02-31.82), less than a high school education (PR, 3.10; 95% CI, 
1.30-7.36), and low HRQOL (fair/poor: PR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.48-9.31). The most
common pattern was poor grip strength, low physical activity, and slowed walk
speed (19.4%). Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged as having an
association with post-KT mortality. KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed
walking speed (hazards ratio = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.17-5.03) and poor grip strength,
exhaustion, and slowed walking speed (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.14-5.97) were
at increased mortality risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty among
KT recipients; however, factors rarely measured as part of clinical practice,
namely, HRQOL, IADL disability, and depressive symptoms, were significant
correlates of frailty. Redefining the frailty phenotype may be needed to improve 
risk stratification for KT recipients.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney
function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in
community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level,
and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0
(normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Frailty status
was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle
weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of
having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were more frail
(odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition,
individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or
hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of
frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. 
Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty 
in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI
1.13-14.1) CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a
higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Geriatr

Dysregulation of skeletal remodeling is a component of renal osteodystrophy.
Previously, we showed that activin receptor signaling is differentially affected 
in various tissues in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether a ligand
trap for the activin receptor type 2A (RAP-011) is an effective treatment of the 
osteodystrophy of the CKD-mineral bone disorder. With a 70% reduction in the
glomerular filtration rate, CKD was induced at 14 weeks of age in the ldlr-/-
high fat-fed mouse model of atherosclerotic vascular calcification and diabetes. 
Twenty mice with CKD, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated
activin A were treated with RAP-011, wherease 19 mice were given vehicle twice
weekly from week 22 until the mice were killed at 28 weeks of age. The animals
were then evaluated by skeletal histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography,
mechanical strength testing, and ex vivo bone cell culture. Results in the CKD
groups were compared with those of the 16 sham-operated ldlr-/- high fat-fed
mice. Sham-operated mice had low-turnover osteodystrophy and skeletal frailty.
CKD stimulated bone remodeling with significant increases in osteoclast and
osteoblast numbers and bone resorption. Compared with mice with CKD
and sham-operated mice, RAP-011 treatment eliminated the CKD-induced increase in 
these histomorphometric parameters and increased trabecular bone fraction.
RAP-011 significantly increased cortical bone area and thickness. Activin
A-enhanced osteoclastogenesis was mediated through p-Smad2 association with c-fos
and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Thus, an
ActRIIA ligand trap reversed CKD-stimulated bone remodeling, likely through
inhibition of activin-A induced osteoclastogenesis.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether frailty, a novel measure of physiologic reserve, is
associated with longer kidney transplant (KT) length of stay (LOS), and modifies 
the association between LOS and mortality.
BACKGROUND: Better understanding of LOS is necessary for informed consent and
discharge planning. Mortality resulting from longer LOS has important regulatory 
implications for hospital and transplant programs. Which recipients are at risk
of prolonged LOS and its effect on mortality are unclear. Frailty is a novel
preoperative predictor of poor KT outcomes including delayed graft function,
early hospital readmission, immunosuppression intolerance, and mortality.
METHODS: We used registry-augmented hybrid methods, a novel approach to risk
adjustment, to adjust for LOS risk factors from the Scientific Registry of
Transplant Recipients (n = 74,859) and tested whether (1) frailty, measured
immediately before KT in a novel cohort (n = 589), was associated with LOS (LOS: 
negative binomial regression; LOS ≥2 weeks: logistic regression) and (2) whether 
frailty modified the association between LOS and mortality (interaction term
analysis).
RESULTS: Frailty was independently associated with longer LOS [relative risk =
1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.29; P = 0.01] and LOS ≥2 weeks (odds
ratio = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.06-2.33; P = 0.03) after accounting for registry-based
risk factors, including delayed graft function. Frailty also attenuated the
association between LOS and mortality (nonfrail hazard rate = 1.55 95% CI:
1.30-1.86; P < 0.001; frail hazard rate = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.19, P = 0.80; P
for interaction = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail KT recipients are more likely to experience a longer LOS.
Longer LOS among nonfrail recipients may be a marker of increased mortality risk.
Frailty is a measure of physiologic reserve that may be an important clinical
marker of longer surgical LOS.

BACKGROUND: Older adults hospitalized with fragility fractures are at high risk
of negative events that can culminate in re-presentations to hospital emergency
departments or readmissions to hospital. This systematic review aimed to identify
patient, clinical, or hospital-related factors that are identifiable at the index
admission and that may be associated with re-presentations to hospital emergency 
departments or hospital readmissions in older adults following fragility
fractures.
METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus) were
searched. A suite of search terms identified peer-reviewed English-language
articles that examined potential correlates of hospital re-presentation in older 
adults (mean age ≥ 65 years) who were discharged from hospital following
treatment for fragility fractures. A three-stage screening process (titles,
abstracts, full text) was conducted by two researchers independently. Participant
characteristics, study design, potential correlates examined, analyses, and
findings were extracted for studies included in the review. Quality and risk of
bias were assessed with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality
Assessment Tool. The strength of evidence was incorporated into a best evidence
synthesis, and meta-analysis was conducted where effect pooling was possible.
RESULTS: Eleven of 35 eligible studies were categorized as high quality studies. 
These studies reported that age, higher Cumulative Illness Rating scores,
American Society of Anesthesiologists scores > 3, longer length of stay, male
sex, cardiovascular disease, low post-operative hemoglobin, kidney disease,
dementia and cancer were factors identified at the index admission that were
predictive of subsequent re-presentation to hospital. Age was the only predictor 
for which pooling of effects across studies was possible: pooling was conducted
for re-presentation ≤ 30 days (pooled OR, 1.27; 95 % CI, 1.14-1.43) and > 30 days
(pooled OR, 1.23; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.50).
CONCLUSIONS: The best-evidence synthesis, in addition to the meta-analysis,
identified a range of factors that may have utility in guiding clinical practice 
and policy guidelines for targeted interventions to reduce the need for
re-presentation to hospital among this frail clinical population. The paucity of 
studies investigating re-presentations to hospital emergency departments without 
admission was an important gap in the literature identified in this review. Key
limitations were exclusion of non-English language studies and grey literature.

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its
impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
is less defined.
METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 
trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three
groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR
≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were
analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors
of 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the
PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767
(30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 
(12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted
Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with
severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher
prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of
death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate
and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% 
in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild
RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus
none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other
significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass
index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction,
oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male
sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year
mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is
required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a perioperative metastatic spinal
tumor frailty index (MSTFI) that could predict morbidity, mortality, and length
of stay.
METHODS: A large inpatient hospitalization database was searched from 2002 to
2011 to identify 4583 patients with spinal metastasis from breast (21.1%), lung
(34.1%), thyroid (3.8%), renal (19.9%), and prostate (21.1%) cancer who underwent
surgery. A multiple logistic regression model identified 9 independent parameters
that were used to construct the MSTFI: anemia, chronic lung disease,
coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary circulation disorders, renal
failure, malnutrition, emergent/urgent admission, and anterior/combined surgical 
approach. Patients with 0 points were categorized as "not frail," 1 as "mildly
frail," 2 as "moderately frail," and ≥3 as "severely frail."
RESULTS: The overall perioperative complication rate was 19.3% and in-patient
mortality was 3.0%. Compared with patients with no frailty, patients with
moderate frailty (odds ratio [OR] 5.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]
2.44-10.86), and severe frailty (OR 5.74; 95% CI 2.69-12.24) had significantly
increased odds of inpatient mortality (all P < 0.001). Similarly, patients with
mild frailty (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.33-2.66), moderate frailty (OR 3.83; 95% CI
2.71-5.41), and severe frailty (OR 6.97; 95% CI 4.98-9.74) had significantly
increased odds of developing a major in-hospital complication (all P < 0.001).
Length of stay also increased significantly by MSTFI (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In surgically treated patients with spinal metastasis, certain
perioperative parameters may significantly predict the risk of major in-hospital 
complications and mortality.

Dialysis care is often associated with poor outcomes including low quality of
life (QOL). To improve patient-reported outcomes, incorporation of the patient's 
needs and perspective into the medical care they receive is essential. This
article provides a framework to help clinicians integrate symptom assessment and 
other measures such as QOL and frailty scores into a clinical approach to the
contemporary supportive care of patients with advanced CKD. This approach
involves (1) defining our understanding of kidney supportive care,
patient-centered dialysis, and palliative dialysis; (2) understanding and
recognizing common symptoms associated with advanced CKD; (3) discussing the
concepts of physical function, frailty, and QOL and their role in CKD; and (4)
identifying the structural and process barriers that may arise when
patient-centered dialysis is being introduced into clinical practice.

Patients aged 80 or over with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) often have
comorbidities that increase drug toxicity and prevent the use of otherwise
optimal treatment. We performed a retrospective analysis of 43 patients aged 80
or over (median age: 83; range: 80-93) unable to receive treatment with
anthracyclines, at diagnosis of DLBCL, treated with an R-CVP treatment (standard 
R-CHOP without doxorubicin). The patients had one or more comorbidities: 18
patients (41.9 %) had a performance status (PS) of 3; 23 patients (53.5 %) had
low creatinine clearance; 12 patients (27.9 %) had low left ventricular ejection 
fraction; seven patients (16.3 %) had poor hepatic function; and 26 patients
(60.5 %) had a Charlson index score ≥4. Thirty patients (70 %) had two or three
adverse factors according to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index.
Twenty-five patients (58.1 %) received eight cycles of R-CVP, but the full eight 
cycles could not be given to 18 patients (41.9 %). The OR rate was 58.1 % (CR
37.2 %). There were 34 deaths (79 %) during treatment and follow-up. Ten patients
(23.3 %) died early from toxicity before interim evaluation; all had PS 3. The
median follow-up of surviving patients was 52.6 months. The overall 2-year
survival rate was 31.9 % and the median OS was 12.6 months. The median OS for
patients who completed the entire treatment was 26.4 months. The median PFS was
11.2 months. In multivariate analyses, OS was only affected by performance status
≥2 and Charlson index score ≥4. The R-CVP regimen can be active in elderly frail 
patients aged 80 or more with DLBCL, but systematic geriatric assessment is

OBJECTIVES: Screening tools to determine which outpatients with cirrhosis are at 
highest risk for unplanned hospitalization are lacking. Frailty is a novel
prognostic factor but conventional screening for frailty is time consuming. We
evaluated the ability of a 1 min bedside screen (Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)) to
predict unplanned hospitalization or death in outpatients with cirrhosis and
compared the CFS with two conventional frailty measures (Fried Frailty Criteria
(FFC) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)).
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive outpatients from three tertiary
care liver clinics. Frailty was defined by CFS >4. The primary outcome was the
composite of unplanned hospitalization or death within 6 months of study entry.
RESULTS: A total of 300 outpatients were enrolled (mean age 57 years, 35% female,
81% white, 66% hepatitis C or alcohol-related liver disease, mean Model for
End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score 12, 28% with ascites). Overall, 54 (18%)
outpatients were frail and 91 (30%) patients had an unplanned hospitalization or 
death within 6 months. CFS >4 was independently associated with increased rates
of unplanned hospitalization or death (57% frail vs. 24% not frail, adjusted odds
ratio 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-7.5; P=0.0008) and there was a dose 
response (adjusted odds ratio 1.9 per 1-unit increase in CFS, 95% CI: 1.4-2.6;
P<0.0001). Models including MELD, ascites, and CFS >4 had a greater
discrimination (c-statistic=0.84) than models using FFC or SPPB.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is strongly and independently associated with an increased
risk of unplanned hospitalization or death in outpatients with cirrhosis. The CFS
is a rapid screen that could be easily adopted in liver clinics to identify those
at highest risk of adverse events.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem that is associated
with excess morbidity, mortality, and health resource utilization. The
progression of CKD is defined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and
leads to a variety of metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypertension,
anemia, and mineral bone disorder. Lower glomerular filtration rate also bears a 
strong relationship with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, end-stage
renal disease, and death. Patterns of CKD progression include linear and
nonlinear trajectories, but kidney function can remain stable for years in some
individuals. Addressing modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD is
needed to attenuate its associated morbidity and mortality. Developing effective 
risk prediction models for CKD progression is critical to identify patients who
are more likely to benefit from interventions and more intensive monitoring.
Accurate risk-prediction algorithms permit systems to best align health care
resources with risk to maximize their effects and efficiency while guiding
overall decision making.

The recent epidemiologic data pointed out, that the general number of patients on
hemodialysis is steadily increasing, especially in group of elderly patients over
75 years old. The geriatric syndromes are a multietiological disorder related to 
physiological aging and partly associated with comorbid conditions. Frailty,
falls, functional decline and disability, cognitive impairment and depression are
main geriatric syndromes and occurs in patients with impaired renal function more
often than among general population. The causes of higher prevalence of those
syndromes are not well known, but uremic environment and overall renal
replacement therapy may have an important impact on its progress. The patient
with geriatric syndrome require comprehensive treatment as well as physical
rehabilitation, psychiatric cure and support in everyday activities. Herein below
we would like to review recent literature regarding to particular features of
main geriatric syndromes in a group of nephrological patients.

Antihypertensive treatment is aimed at reducing as much as possible health
outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. The main international guidelines
and clinical trials showed different positions about blood pressure targets. At
present, there is no common opinion about the benefits of an aggressive drug
treatment; moreover it is not clear whether lower blood pressure values are
related to increased morbidity and mortality. The recent randomized SPRINT trial 
has compared intensive vs standard drug therapy in a non-diabetic hypertensive
population. The trial has shown benefits of intensive treatment in reducing
important health outcomes, though results were not confirmed in several patient
subsets. We examined the studies on hypertensive patients with comorbidities
(i.e., chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) to identify blood pressure
targets recommended in these populations, but no strong evidence was found about 
the benefits of intensive treatment. In geriatric patients the "lower is better" 
paradigm cannot be entirely applied because of comorbidity, polypharmacy and
frailty.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients have an increased risk for acute kidney injury
(AKI). However, few studies have reported on predictors for AKI in geriatric
patients. Therefore, we aimed at determining the effect of frailty as a predictor
of AKI.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 533 hospitalized elderly patients (aged ≥ 65
years) who had their creatinine levels measured (≥ 1 measurement) during
admission for a period of 1 year (2013) and conducted a comprehensive geriatric
assessment (CGA) within 1 year before the index hospitalization. We examined five
variables (activity of daily living [ADL] and instrumental ADL dependence,
dementia, nutrition, and polypharmacy) from CGA. We categorized the patients into
3 groups according to the tertile of aggregate frailty scores: Group 1, score
1-2; Group 2, score 3-4; Group 3, score 5-8).
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (10.1%) developed AKI (median duration, 4 days). The
frailest group (Group 3) showed an increased risk of AKI as compared to Group 1, 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 3.536, P = 0.002). We found that discriminatory accuracy for
AKI improved with the addition of the tertile of aggregate frailty score to
covariates (area under the receiver operator characteristics curves [AUROC]
0.641, AUROC 0.739, P = 0.004). Forty-six patients (8.6%) were transferred to
nursing facilities and 477 patients (89.5%) were discharged home. The overall
90-day and 1-year mortality for elderly inpatients were 7.9% and 26.3%. The
frailest group also demonstrated an increased risk of discharge to nursing
facilities, and 90-day and 1-year mortality as compared to Group 1, independent
of AKI severity (nursing facilities: odd ratio = 4.843, P = 0.002; 90-day
mortality: HR = 6.555, P = 0.002; 1-year mortality: HR = 3.249, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that frailty may independently predict the development of
AKI and adverse outcomes in geriatric inpatients.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

Skeletal muscle mass and muscle function are negatively affected by a variety of 
conditions inherent to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to dialysis treatment.
Skeletal muscle mass and function serve as indicators of the nutritional and
clinical state of CKD patients, and low values or derangements over time are
strong predictors of poor patient outcomes. However, muscle size and function can
be affected by different factors, may decline at different rates, and may have
different patient implications. Therefore, operational definitions of frailty and
sarcopenia have emerged to encompass these 2 dimensions of muscle health, i.e.,
size and functionality. The aim of this review is to appraise available methods
for assessment of muscle mass and functionality, with an emphasis on their
accuracy in the setting of CKD patients. We then discuss the selection of
reference cutoffs for defining conditions of muscle wasting and dysfunction.
Finally, we review definitions applied in studies addressing sarcopenia and
frailty in CKD patients and discuss their applicability for diagnosis and
monitoring.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with
postoperative delirium in patients undergoing urological surgery.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated pre- and postoperative risk factors for
postoperative delirium in consecutive 215 patients who received urological
surgery between August 2013 and November 2014. Preoperative factors included
patient demographics, comorbidities, and frailty assessment. Frailty was measured
by handgrip strength, fatigue scale of depression, fall risk assessment, and gait
speed (the timed Get-up and Go test). Postoperative factors included types of
anesthesia, surgical procedure, renal function and serum albumin decline, blood
loss, surgery time, highest body temperature, and complications. Uni- and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess pre- and
postoperative predictors for the development of postoperative delirium.
RESULTS: Median age of this cohort was 67 years. Ten patients (4.7%) experienced 
postoperative delirium. These patients were significantly older, had weak
handgrip strength, a higher fall risk assessment score, slow gait speed, and
greater renal function decline compared with patients without delirium.
Multivariate analysis revealed slow gait speed (>13.0 s) and rapid renal function
decline (>30%) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow gait speed and rapid renal function decline after urological
surgery are significant factors for postoperative delirium. These data will be
helpful for perioperative patient management. This study was registered as a
clinical trial: UMIN: R000018809.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With aging of the general population, patients who
enter dialysis therapy will more frequently have geriatric impairments and a
considerable comorbidity burden. The most vulnerable among these patients might
benefit from conservative therapy. Whether assessment of geriatric impairments
would contribute to the decision-making process of dialysis initiation is
unknown.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A systematic Medline and Embase
search was performed on December 1, 2015 to identify studies assessing the
association between risk of mortality or hospitalization and one or more
geriatric impairments at the start of dialysis therapy, including impairment of
cognitive function, mood, performance status or (instrumental) activities of
daily living, mobility (including falls), social environment, or nutritional
status.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were identified that assessed one or more geriatric
impairments with respect to prognosis. The quality of most studies was moderate. 
Only seven studies carried out an analysis of elderly patients (≥70 years old).
Malnutrition and frailty were systematically assessed, and their relation with
mortality was clear. In addition, cognitive impairment and functional outcomes at
the initiation of dialysis were related to an increased mortality in most
studies. However, not all studies applied systematic assessment tools, thereby
potentially missing relevant impairment. None of the studies applied a geriatric 
assessment across multiple domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric impairment across multiple domains at dialysis initiation 
is related to poor outcome. However, information in the elderly is sparse, and a 
systematic approach of multiple domains with respect to poor outcome has not been
performed. Because a geriatric assessment has proved useful in predicting outcome
in other medical fields, its potential role in the ESRD population should be the 
subject of future research.

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with
destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial
cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However,
surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis
rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on
hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal
kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree
decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior
instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to
adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical 
motion.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is related
to frailty and to characterize the nature of their joint association with
mortality.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis for frailty and longitudinal cohort analysis for
mortality.
SETTING: Cardiovascular Health Study.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals (N = 2,977; mean age 77.9 ± 4.7, 40%
male, 83% white).
MEASUREMENTS: The predictor was serum FGF-23 concentration (C-terminal
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the outcomes were frailty status
(determined according to frailty phenotype criteria of weight loss, weakness,
exhaustion, slowness, and low physical activity) and mortality. Multinomial
logistic regression was used to assess the cross-sectional association between
FGF-23 and frailty and prefrailty, adjusting for demographic characteristics,
cardiovascular disease and risk factors, and kidney markers. Proportional hazards
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between
FGF-23, frailty, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 64 ± 17 mL/min per 
1.73 m(2) . Median FGF-23 was 70.3 RU/mL (interquartile range 53.4-99.2); 52%
were prefrail, and 13% were frail. After multivariate adjustment, each doubling
in FGF-23 concentration was associated with 38% (95% confidence interval (CI) =
17-62%) higher odds of frailty than of nonfrailty and 16% (95% CI = 3-30%) higher
odds of prefrailty. FGF-23 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.10-1.23) and
frailty (HR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.57-2.12) were independently associated with
mortality, but neither association was meaningfully attenuated when adjusted for 
the other.
CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of older adults, higher FGF-23 was independently
associated with prevalent frailty and prefrailty. FGF-23 and frailty were
independent and additive risk factors for mortality. FGF-23 may be a marker for
functional outcomes.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

Alto, California, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is the concept of accumulating physiologic declines
that make people less able to deal with stressors, including surgery.
Prehabilitation is intervention to enhance functional capacity before surgery.
Frailty and prehabilitation among transplant populations and the role of wearable
fitness tracking devices (WFTs) in delivering fitness-based interventions will be
discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty is associated with increased complications, longer
length of hospital stay and increased mortality after surgery. Frail kidney
transplant patients have increased delayed graft function, mortality and early
hospital readmission. Frail lung or liver transplant patients are more likely to 
delist or die on the waitlist. Prehabilitation can mitigate frailty and has
resulted in decreased length of hospital stay and fewer postsurgical
complications among a variety of surgical populations. Increasingly, WFTs are
used to monitor patient activity and improve patient health. Interventions using 
WFTs have resulted in improved activity, weight loss and blood pressure.
SUMMARY: Frailty is a measurable parameter that identifies patients at risk for
worse health outcomes and can be mitigated through intervention. Prehabilitation 
to reduce frailty has been shown to improve postsurgical outcomes in a variety of
populations. WFTs are being integrated in healthcare delivery for monitoring and 
changing health behavior with promising results.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure (HBP) are commonly
associated conditions in the elderly population. An effect of treatments,
biologic and anthropometric variables on long-term mortality is unknown in this
population.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of HBP control in a sample of elderly
patients with type 2 diabetes with office blood pressure (BP) readings and
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and evaluate the influence of BP,
anthropometric and laboratory variables on long term mortality.
METHODS: Cohort study in patients living at home in the area of Sherbrooke, ≥65
years old, receiving reimbursement for antidiabetic medication. The study
included medical history, 2 sets of BP measurements, 2 24-hour urinary
collections for microalbuminuria, 1 24-hour ABPM, blood level of creatinine and
glycosylated hemoglobin. Charts were reanalyzed 8 years later for analysis of
cardiovascular and total mortality cases.
RESULTS: 198 patients were initially recruited. By history, 83% of the subjects
had diagnoses and treatments for high blood pressure. In multivariate analysis,
factors associated with an 8-year increased risk for cardiovascular mortality
were creatinine ≥84 µmol/L, office seated systolic blood pressure ≤130 and
diastolic BP ≤67.6 over 24 hours. Factors associated with total mortality were
lower waist circumference, serum creatinine ≥84 and diastolic BP ≤67.6 over 24
hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower systolic and diastolic BP (office and ABPM), lower waist
circumference and higher creatinine values are associated with an increased
mortality risk. This suggests that a lower BP, declining kidney function and
frailty are factors associated with this observation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement
can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light
chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies
have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We
evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in
France.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered
in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 
with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored
for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as
renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and 
causes of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334
(23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72
years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was
observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation
was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis,
67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were 
malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and
cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty 
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high
BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is
poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of
death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been reported regarding impact of body mass 
index (BMI) on outcome of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients.
This study evaluates the impact of BMI on 1 year mortality in patients undergoing
TAVR via the transfemoral (TF) access.
METHODS: Aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing TAVR via a TF access between
May 2007 and December 2014 were categorized to 4 groups by BMI: low (<20), normal
(20-24.9), overweight (25-30), and obese (>30). Baseline parameters were
compared, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were
generated to assess outcome differences.
RESULTS: Among 491 severe AS TAVR patients, 43 had low BMI, 148 had normal BMI,
162 were overweight, and 138 were obese. Obese patients were younger with lower
Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores and higher rates of preserved ejection
fraction and diabetes. There was a higher rate of women in the BMI extremes.
Aortic valve area was higher among obese patients; however, the indexed area was 
inversely correlated with BMI. Vascular complications and transfusions were more 
common in the low-BMI group, while acute kidney injury was more common in obese
patients. All-cause mortality at 1 year was higher in the low-BMI group (log-rank
p = 0.003) with no significant difference among normal and above-normal BMI
patients. In a multivariate model, BMI <20 kg/m(2) was an independent predictor
of mortality (HR = 2.45, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: BMI <20 kg/m(2) should be considered a frailty marker during the
screening process of severe AS TAVR patients as it is associated with higher
mortality, while obesity confers similar mortality risk as normal weight. © 2015

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In-center hemodialysis (HD) is often the default
dialysis modality for older patients. Few centers use assisted peritoneal
dialysis (PD), which enables treatment at home. This observational study compared
quality of life (QoL) and physical function between older patients on assisted PD
and HD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Patients on assisted PD who were
>60 years old and on dialysis for >3 months were recruited and matched to
patients on HD (needing hospital transport) by age, sex, diabetes, dialysis
vintage, ethnicity, and index of deprivation. Frailty was assessed using the
Clinical Frailty Scale. QoL assessments included Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS), Short Form-12, Palliative Outcomes Symptom Scale (renal), Illness
Intrusiveness Rating Scale, and Renal Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire
(RTSQ). Physical function was evaluated by Barthel Score and timed up and go
test.
RESULTS: In total, 251 patients (129 PD and 122 HD) were recruited. In unadjusted
analysis, patients on assisted PD had a higher prevalence of possible depression 
(HADS>8; PD=38.8%; HD=23.8%; P=0.05) and higher HADS depression score (median:
PD=6; HD=5; P=0.05) but higher RTSQ scores (median: PD=55; HD=51; P<0.01). In a
generalized linear regression model adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, dialysis
vintage, and frailty, assisted PD continued to be associated with higher RTSQ
scores (P=0.04) but not with other QoL measures.
CONCLUSIONS: There are no differences in measures of QoL and physical function
between older patients on assisted PD and comparable patients on HD, except for
treatment satisfaction, which is higher in patients on PD. Assisted PD should be 
considered as an alternative to HD for older patients, allowing them to make
their preferred choices.

Consequences of aging are gaining clinical relevance. In transplantation, aging
and immunosenescence impact treatment and outcomes. The impact of aging, however,
will critically depend on distinguishing healthy, chronological aging from
biological aging that may result into frailty. Approximately 15% of individuals
older than 65 years are frail, and it is expected that this condition will gain
more clinical relevance with an expected increase to greater than 20% over the
next 5 years. Clearly, frailty impacts various general aspects of health care and
organ transplantation in particular including patient selection, waitlist
management and treatment after transplantation. In general, frailty has been
characterized by a compromised physiological reserve and an augmented
vulnerability. In comparison to healthy aging, inflammatory markers and cytokines
are increased in frail older adults. Thus, modifications of the immune response, 
in addition to physical limitations and changes of metabolism, are likely to
impact outcomes after transplantation. Here, we provide a risk assessment of
frailty at the time of transplant evaluation and review effects on outcomes and
recovery after transplantation. Moreover, we summarize our current understanding 
of the pathophysiology of frailty and consequences on immune responses and
metabolism.

Intermediate- or low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis were excluded from
earlier transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) clinical trials; however, 
they are already being treated by TAVI despite a lack of data regarding the
safety and efficacy in these patients. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy
of TAVI in patients at intermediate or low risk. Patients undergoing TAVI during 
2008 to 2014 were included into a shared database (n = 1,327). Procedural
outcomes were adjudicated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 2
definitions. Patients were stratified according to their Society of Thoracic
Surgeons (STS) score into 3 groups: high (STS ≥8, n = 223, 17%), intermediate
(STS 4 to 8; n = 496, 38%), or low risk (STS <4; n = 576, 45%). Low-risk patients
were significantly younger and more likely to be men compared to intermediate-
and high-risk patients. Baseline characteristics differed significantly between
the groups with a gradual increase in the rates of previous bypass surgery,
stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, lung disease, and frailty
scores, from low to high risk groups. Compared with intermediate- and high-risk
patients, low-risk patients were more likely to undergo TAVI through the
transfemoral route (81% vs 88% vs 95%, p <0.001) and under conscious sedation
(69% vs 72% vs 81%, <0.001). There were no significant differences in the rates
of procedural complications apart from acute kidney injury (19% vs 17% vs 13%, p 
= 0.03) and stroke rates (4.5% vs 2% vs 2.3%, p = 0.1). Short- and long-term
mortality rates were significantly higher for intermediate- (hazard ratio [HR]
1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 2.9) and high-risk patients (HR 4.1, 95%
CI 2.7 to 6.4) than low-risk patients also after multivariate adjustment (HR 1.6,
95% CI 1 to 2.6 and HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 4.5, respectively; all p <0.05). In
conclusion, TAVI for intermediate- and low-risk patients is safe and associated
with improved outcome compared with high-risk patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients of all ages undergoing hemodialysis (HD) have
a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and worse cognitive function than
healthy controls, and those with dementia are at high risk of death. Frailty has 
been associated with poor cognitive function in older adults without kidney
disease. We hypothesized that frailty might also be associated with poor
cognitive function in adults of all ages undergoing HD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: At HD initiation, 324 adults
enrolled (November 2008 to July 2012) in a longitudinal cohort study (Predictors 
of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in ESRD) were classified into three groups 
(frail, intermediately frail, and nonfrail) based on the Fried frailty phenotype.
Global cognitive function (3MS) and speed/attention (Trail Making Tests A and B
[TMTA and TMTB, respectively]) were assessed at cohort entry and 1-year
follow-up. Associations between frailty and cognitive function (at cohort entry
and 1-year follow-up) were evaluated in adjusted (for sex, age, race, body mass
index, education, depression and comorbidity at baseline) linear (3MS, TMTA) and 
Tobit (TMTB) regression models.
RESULTS: At cohort entry, the mean age was 54.8 years (SD 13.3), 56.5% were men, 
and 72.8% were black. The prevalence of frailty and intermediate frailty were
34.0% and 37.7%, respectively. The mean 3MS was 89.8 (SD 7.6), TMTA was 55.4 (SD 
29), and TMTB was 161 (SD 83). Frailty was independently associated with lower
cognitive function at cohort entry for all three measures (3MS: -2.4 points; 95% 
confidence interval [95% CI], -4.2 to -0.5; P=0.01; TMTA: 12.1 seconds; 95% CI,
4.7 to 19.4; P<0.001; and TMTB: 33.2 seconds; 95% CI, 9.9 to 56.4; P=0.01; all
tests for trend, P<0.001) and with worse 3MS at 1-year follow-up (-2.8 points;
95% CI, -5.4 to -0.2; P=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: In adult incident HD patients, frailty is associated with worse
cognitive function, particularly global cognitive function (3MS).

INTRODUCTION: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) are earlier frail than
people in the general population. Although this may be explained by lifelong
unfavourable social, psychological and clinical causes, underlying physiological 
pathways might be considered too. Biological measures can help identify
pathophysiological pathways. Therefore, we examined the association between
frailty and a range of serum markers on inflammation, anaemia, the metabolic
system, micronutrients and renal functioning.
METHODS: Participants (n = 757) with borderline to severe ID (50+) were recruited
from three Dutch ID care and support services.
RESULTS: Frailty was measured with a frailty index, a measure based on the
accumulation of deficits. Linear regression analyses were performed to identify
associations between frailty and biochemical measures independent of age, gender,
level of ID and the presence of Down syndrome. Frailty appears associated with
inflammation (IL-6 and CRP), anaemia, metabolic markers (glucose, cholesterol and
albumin) and renal functioning (cystatin-C and creatinine).
DISCUSSION: These results are in line with results observed in the general
population. Future research needs to investigate the causal relation between
biochemical measures and frailty, with a special focus on inflammation and
nutrition. Furthermore, the possibility to screen for frailty using biochemical
measures needs to be used.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the natural history of frailty after an aggressive
surgical intervention, kidney transplantation (KT).
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study (December 2008-March 2014).
SETTING: Baltimore, Maryland.
PARTICIPANTS: Kidney transplantation recipients (N = 349).
MEASUREMENTS: The Fried frailty score was measured at the time of KT and during
routine clinical follow-up. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, factors
associated with improvements in frailty score after KT were identified. Using a
longitudinal analysis, predictors of frailty score changes after KT were
identified using a multilevel mixed-effects Poisson model.
RESULTS: At KT, 19.8% of recipients were frail; 1 month after KT, 33.3% were
frail; at 2 months, 27.7% were frail; and at 3 months, 17.2% were frail. On
average, frailty scores had worsened by 1 month (mean change 0.4, P < .001),
returned to baseline by 2 months (mean change 0.2, P = .07), and improved by 3
months (mean change -0.3, P = .04) after KT. The only recipient or transplant
factor associated with improvement in frailty score after KT was pre-KT frailty
(hazard ratio = 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.71-3.82, P < .001). Pre-KT
frailty status (relative risk (RR) = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.29-1.72, P < .001),
recipient diabetes mellitus (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.08-1.46, P = .003), and
delayed graft function (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04-1.43, P = .02) were
independently associated with long-term changes in frailty score.
CONCLUSION: After KT, in adult recipients of all ages, frailty initially worsens 
but then improves by 3 months. Although KT recipients who were frail at KT had
higher frailty scores over the long term, they were most likely to show
improvements in their physiological reserve after KT, supporting the
transplantation in these individuals and suggesting that pretransplant frailty is
not an irreversible state of low physiological reserve.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

Elderly patients receiving a kidney from old donors (old-to-old) are a growing
population of transplant recipients. This population cumulates risks of
complications due to the co-morbidities and the immunodeficiency state and the
frailty of the recipients together with the kidney senescence of the donors. In
this context, the choice of immunosuppression is complicated and must take into
account some contradictory principles explaining why no consensus exists today.

Stroke prevention in elderly atrial fibrillation patients remains a challenge.
There is a high risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism but also a high risk 
of bleeding if anticoagulants are prescribed. The elderly have increased chronic 
kidney disease, coronary artery disease, polypharmacy, and overall frailty. For
all these reasons, anticoagulant use is underutilized in the elderly. In this
manuscript, the benefits of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared
with warfarin in the elderly patient population with multiple comorbid conditions
are reviewed.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established technique for
the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Data on long-term TAVI
outcomes, both hemodynamic and clinical, in real-world practice settings are
limited. We aim to explore the long-term clinical results in patients with severe
symptomatic aortic stenosis using multiple catheter-based options: 360
TAVI-treated patients were followed up for ≤5 years. The Medtronic CoreValve was 
used in 71% and the Edwards SAPIEN in 26%. The primary end point was all-cause
mortality during follow-up. Outcomes were assessed based on the Valve Academic
Research Consortium 2 criteria. The mean ± SD patient age was 82.1 ± 6.9 years
(56.4% women). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 7.5 ± 4.7. The clinical
efficacy end point and time-related valve safety at 3 years was 50% and 81.7%,
respectively. The calculated 3- and 5-year survival rates were 71.6% and 56.4%,
respectively. Five-year follow-up data were obtained for 54 patients alive; 96.2%
of alive patients were in the New York Heart Association class I and II, 4 years 
after TAVI. No gender differences in all-cause mortality rates were observed (p =
0.58). In multivariate analysis, hospitalization 6 months previous to TAVI
(hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 3.15, p = 0.01),
frailty (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.2, p = 0.02), acute kidney injury (HR 1.93,
95% CI 1.03 to 3.61, p = 0.04), and moderate or more paravalvular aortic
regurgitation after TAVI (HR 4.26, 95% CI 2.54 to 7.15, p <0.001) were
independent predictors for all-cause mortality. In conclusion, long-term outcomes
of TAVI are encouraging. Prevention and early identification of paravalvular leak
and acute renal failure after the procedure would improve short- and long-term
outcomes.

AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to 
complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and
functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total
number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and
assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD
0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified
Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P =
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good
construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the
potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for
patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between performance on a single chair
stand and moderate to severe exertional dyspnea.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Cardiovascular Health Study.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and older (N = 4,413; mean
age 72.6; female, n = 2,518 (57.1%); nonwhite, n = 199 (4.5%); obese, n = 788
(17.9%); history of smoking, n = 2,410 (54.6%)).
MEASUREMENTS: Performance on single chair stand (poor (unable to rise without arm
use) vs normal (able to rise without arm use)), moderate to severe exertional
dyspnea (American Thoracic Society grade ≥2), age, sex, ethnicity, obesity,
smoking, frailty status (Fried-defined nonfrail, prefrail, frail), high
cardiopulmonary risk (composite of cardiopulmonary diseases and diabetes
mellitus), spirometric impairment, arthritis, depression, stroke, and kidney
disease.
RESULTS: Poor performance on the single chair stand was established in 369 (8.4%)
and moderate to severe exertional dyspnea in 773 (17.5%). Prefrail status was
established in 2,210 (50.1%), frail status in 360 (8.2%), arthritis in 2,241
(51.4%), high cardiopulmonary risk in 2,469 (55.9%), spirometric impairment in
1,076 (24.4%), kidney disease in 111 (2.5%), depression in 107 (2.4%), and stroke
in 93 (2.1%). In multivariable regression models, poor performance on the single 
chair stand was associated with moderate to severe exertional dyspnea (unadjusted
odds ratio (OR) = 3.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.78-4.36; adjusted OR =
1.85, 95% CI = 1.41-2.41).
CONCLUSION: Poor performance on a single chair stand was associated with an
adjusted 85% greater likelihood of moderate to severe exertional dyspnea than
normal performance. These results suggest that reduced proximal muscle function
of the lower extremities is associated with moderate to severe exertional
dyspnea, even after adjusting for multiple confounders.

OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively validate and compare a modified frailty index
predicting adverse outcomes and other risk stratification tools among patients
undergoing urologic oncological surgeries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program was queried from 2005 to 2013 to identify patients undergoing
cystectomy, prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and nephroureterectomy. Using the
Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index, 11 variables were matched to
the database; 4 were also added because of their relevance in oncology patients. 
The incidence of mortality, Clavien-Dindo IV complications, and adverse events
were assessed with patients grouped according to their modified frailty index
score.
RESULTS: We identified 41,681 patients who were undergoing surgery for presumed
urologic malignancy. Patients with a high frailty index score of >0.20 had a 3.70
odds of a Clavien-Dindo IV event (CI: 2.865-4.788, P<0.0005) and a 5.95 odds of
30-day mortality (CI: 3.72-9.51, P<0.0005) in comparison with nonfrail patients
after adjusting for race, sex, age, smoking history, and procedure. Using
C-statistics to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the predictive ability
of different models per risk stratification tool and the Akaike information
criteria to assess for the fit of the models with the data, the modified frailty 
index was comparable or superior to the Charlson comorbidity index but inferior
to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class in predicting 30-day
mortality or Clavien-Dindo IV events. When the modified frailty index was
augmented with the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class, the new
index was superior in all aspects in comparison to other risk stratification
tools.
CONCLUSION: Existing risk stratification tools may be improved by incorporating
variables in our 15-point modified frailty index as well as other factors such as
walking speed, exhaustion, and sarcopenia to fully assess frailty. This is
relevant in diseases such as kidney and prostate cancer, where surveillance and
other nonsurgical interventions exist as alternatives to a potentially
complicated surgery. In these scenarios, our modified frailty index augmented by 
the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class may help inform which
patients have increased surgical complications that may outweigh the benefit of
surgery although this index needs prospective validation.

It is known that the common physiological denominator of the ageing process is an
attenuation of functional performance with respect to the situation of young
people and adults. However, since the first cohort-based longitudinal studies, it
has not been possible to establish a "linear" relationship between age and
glomerular filtration in all cases. This does not mean that there is no
physiological ageing process at all; in addition to those already elucidated, its
mechanisms include cell senescence, podocyte dysfunction, a vitamin D deficiency,
and homozygotic forms of the MYH9 gene. The aim of the present work was to
analyse the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and, where possible, the
correlation between CKD, defined by an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), plasma
25(OH)D3 levels and the MYH9 gene in a population of elderly and very elderly
persons. These parameters have not been evaluated previously in populations of
elderly and very elderly patients. It is concluded that a moderate decrease in
the eGFR occurs with age. This does not imply the presence of CKD in elderly
people, since in most individuals the reduced eGFR is not accompanied by anaemia,
and no individuals show hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia or a high Alb/Cr ratio.
Here we observed a lower Hb level and an elevated Alb/Cr ratio in subjects
heterozygotic for the MYH9 gene. This could be interpreted in the sense that the 
gene could exert some protective effect on renal function, whereas the
heterozygotic form (allele A) of the MYH9 gene could be considered a very early
marker, a new risk factor for the appearance of CKD, or a sign of renal frailty
in elderly people.

The elderly population is increasing worldwide and shows an increasing prevalence
of frailty. Frailty is recognized as an important factor for inappropriate drug
prescribing in elderly patients. Appropriate drug prescription, either in terms
of drug choice or in terms of drug dosage, is of paramount importance among the
frail elderly patients, this requiring the need of a difficult balance between
efficacy, safety and tolerability. Bacterial infections are quite frequent among 
the elderly, and use of antimicrobials may be associated with severe adverse
events in this population, especially when in presence of co-medications and/or
of co-morbidities. The aim of this paper is to argue about the most recent
published evidences on how to prevent major adverse events whenever
antimicrobials should be co-prescribed in frail elderly patients.

This study aims to identify at the expression level the immune-related genes
associated with IPN-susceptible and resistant phenotypes in Atlantic salmon
full-sibling families. We have analyzed thirty full-sibling families infected by 
immersion with IPNV and then classified as resistant or susceptible using a
multivariate survival analysis based on a gamma-Cox frailty model and the
Kaplan-Meier mortality curves. In four families within each group head kidneys
were pooled for real-time PCR and one-color salmon-specific oligonucleotide
microarray (21K) analysis at day 1 and 5 post-infection. Transcripts involved in 
innate response (IL-6, IFN-α), antigen presentation (HSP-70, HSP-90, MHC-I), TH1 
response (IL-12, IFN-γ, CRFB6), immunosuppression (IL-10, TGF-β1) and leukocyte
activation and migration (CCL-19, CD18) showed a differential expression pattern 
between both phenotypes, except in IL-6. In susceptible families, except for
IFN-γ, the expressions dropped to basal values at day 5 post-infection. In
resistant families, unlike susceptible families, levels remained high or
increased (except for IL-6) at day 5. Transcriptomic analysis showed that both
families have a clear differential expression pattern, resulting in a marked
down-regulation in immune related genes involved in innate response, complement
system, antigen recognition and activation of immune response in IPN-resistant.
Down-regulation of genes, mainly related to tissue differentiation and protein
degradation metabolism, was also observed in resistant families. We have
identified an immune-related gene patterns associated with susceptibility and
resistance to IPNV infection of Atlantic salmon. This suggests that a limited
immune response is associated with resistant fish phenotype to IPNV challenge
while a highly inflammatory but short response is associated with susceptibility.

BACKGROUND: The elderly form an expanding proportion of patients with chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide. The increased physiological
frailty and functional morbidity associated with the aging process pose unique
challenges when planning optimal management of an older patient needing renal
replacement therapy (RRT).
AIMS: This position paper discusses current evidence regarding the optimal
management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly with an emphasis on
hemodialysis since it is the most common modality used in older patients. Further
research is needed to define relevant patient-reported outcome measures for
end-stage renal disease including functional assessments and psychological
impacts of various forms of RRT. For those older patients who have opted for
dialysis treatment, it is important to study the strategies that encourage
greater uptake of home-based dialysis therapies and optimal vascular access.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of advanced chronic kidney disease in the elderly can
be challenging but also extremely rewarding. The key issue is adopting a
patient-focused and individualized approach that seeks to achieve the best
outcomes based on a comprehensive holistic assessment of what is important to the
patient.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition 
with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more
frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other
chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in
pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an
outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was
modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was
used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed 
using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.
RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were
significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those 
who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of
frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was
significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower
physical and mental quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in
pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential
role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of
life.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

Body composition in chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

Aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of chronic diseases such as
arthritis, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, Alzheimer's
disease, macular degeneration, frailty, and certain forms of cancers. It is
widely regarded that chronic inflammation may be a common link in all these
age-related diseases. This raises the question, can one alter the course of aging
and potentially slow the development of all chronic diseases by manipulating the 
mechanisms that cause age-related inflammation? Emerging evidence suggests that
pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18 show an age-dependent
regulation implicating inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation in the aging
process. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) family of innate immune cell sensors, such
as the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin
domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome controls the caspase-1 activation in
myeloid-lineage cells in several organs during aging. The NLRP3 inflammasome is
especially relevant to aging as it can get activated in response to structurally 
diverse damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as extracellular ATP,
excess glucose, ceramides, amyloids, urate, and cholesterol crystals, all of
which increase with age. Interestingly, reduction in NLRP3-mediated inflammation 
prevents age-related insulin resistance, bone loss, cognitive decline, and
frailty. NLRP3 is a major driver of age-related inflammation and therefore
dietary or pharmacological approaches to lower aberrant inflammasome activation
holds promise in reducing multiple chronic diseases of age and may enhance
healthspan.

Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are life-threatening
complications after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only
half of CD20-positive PTLDs respond to rituximab monotherapy, and outcomes remain
poor for patients with relapsed/refractory disease, especially those who do not
qualify for an anthracycline containing regimen due to frailty or comorbidities. 
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) might be an option in this particular setting. We report
a panel of eight patients with rituximab refractory/relapsed CD20-positive PTLDs 
including three ineligible for subsequent CHOP-like chemotherapy who received
(90) Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan as a single agent (n = 7) or combined to chemotherapy
(n = 1). Five out of eight patients were kidney transplant recipients, while 2/8 
had a liver transplant and 1/8 had a heart transplant. Patients received a median
of two previous therapies. Overall response rate was 62.5%. Importantly, all
responders achieved complete response. At a median follow-up of 37 months [5;
84], complete response was ongoing in four patients. Toxicity was predominantly
hematological and easily manageable. No graft rejection was noticed concomitantly
or following RIT administration despite immunosuppression reduction after
diagnosis of PTLDs. This report emphasizes the potential efficiency of salvage
RIT for early rituximab refractory PTLDs without any unexpected toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Falls among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have
significant consequences for quality of life and functional independence,
morbidity, healthcare utilization and even mortality, but studies on the etiology
of falls within large HD cohorts are limited.
METHODS: Falls during the past 12 months were ascertained for a prevalent
multi-center HD cohort (n = 762) aged 20-92 years, and associations with
demographic and treatment characteristics, comorbidities, cognitive function,
prescribed medications, balance tests, frailty and depressive symptoms were
assessed.
RESULTS: Falls were sustained by 28.4% of participants. In multivariable-adjusted
analyses, participants classified as frail were over two times more likely to
report falls [odds ratio (OR): 2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-4.71, P =
0.01], and participants with a CES-D score 18+ and/or prescribed antidepressants 
were over 80% more likely to be fallers (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.23-2.74, P = 0.003) 
than were participants with a CES-D score <18 and no prescribed antidepressants.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty and depressed mood, factors that are potentially modifiable,
are prominently associated with falls.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and
nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney
disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia
are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here.
RECENT FINDINGS: The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among
the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The
association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD 
stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely
associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger
associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy
supplementation combined with low-protein diet for the management of CKD may
prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but
dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis 
therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum
bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23 mEq/l for
nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A
benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven.
SUMMARY: Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and
integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing
comorbidities.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients 
on dialysis; however, previous studies have not taken into account the severity
of frailty as a predictor of outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess if
there was an association between the degree of frailty and mortality among
patients on incident dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A cohort study of incident chronic
dialysis patients was conducted between January of 2009 and June of 2013 (last
follow-up in December of 2013). On the basis of overall clinical impression, the 
Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score was determined for patients at the start of
dialysis by their primary nephrologist. This simple scale allocates a single
point to different states of frailty (1, very fit; 2, well; 3, managing well; 4, 
vulnerable; 5, mildly frail; 6, moderately frail; 7, severely frail or terminally
ill) with an emphasis on function of the assessed individual. The primary outcome
was time to death. Patients were censored at the time of transplantation.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 390 patients with completed CFS scores (mean age
of 63±15 years old). Most were Caucasian (89%) and men (67%), and 30% of patients
had ESRD caused by diabetic nephropathy. The median Charlson Comorbidity Index
score was 4 (interquartile range =3-6), and the median CFS score was 4
(interquartile range =2-5). There were 96 deaths over 750 patient-years at risk. 
In an adjusted Cox survival analysis, the hazard ratio associated with each
1-point increase in the CFS was 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.43;
P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher severity of frailty (as defined by the CFS) at dialysis
initiation is associated with higher mortality.

AIM: Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on its impact
on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different
self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these patients has not been
attempted before.
METHODS: A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural centre was
recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered
to these patients. Clinical and dialysis-related laboratory parameters were
collected. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis
complications were performed, and variables demonstrating significant
correlations were entered into multivariate regression models to determine their 
independent associations.
RESULTS: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail
Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and
Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic
dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire showed significant association with each
other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated
significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher Liu's
comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and creatinine
levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The other five
questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important
dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis
identified an independently negative association between serum albumin and the
simple FRAIL scale results (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study establishing the utility of different
self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients.
The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a closer relationship with
dialysis-related complications.

Multi-MitraClip therapy for severe degenerative mitral regurgitation: "anchor"
technique for extremely flail segments.

Center, Sacramento, California.

In high-risk or inoperable patients, implantation of MitraClip for treatment of
severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR) from central (A2/P2 pathology,
EVEREST patient) is effective in reducing symptoms and improving functional
class. Extending the use of MitraClip to the non-EVEREST patient is of
considerable interest. MitraClip implantation for wide flail segments and
non-central MR is technically more challenging but represents an important and
highly prevalent subset of patients. We present a case of an 82-year-old male
referred to our institution for medically refractory primary MR. Trans-esophageal
echocardiogram demonstrated severe (4+) MR, annular dilatation, P3 > P2 mitral
valve prolapse, malcoaptation, and wide flail gaps and widths. The patient's age,
frailty, chronic kidney disease, and mild cognitive impairment rendered him a
candidate for MitraClip therapy. Our target area, the areas of maximum flail
(A3/P3), proved too wide for grasping. Hence, the first clip was deployed medial 
to the target area. Subsequent deployment, in a sequential fashion ("zipper
technique"), was not technically feasible due to persistent instability of the
target area. Consideration was given to an alternative approach by "anchoring"
our target area where the 2nd and 3rd clips were deployed lateral to the A3/P3
segment in efforts to "anchor" the maximum flail segment. This maneuver allowed
final clip deployment into a more stable target area. Subsequent imaging
demonstrated reduction in MR from 4+ to 1+ with preservation of a normal
transmitral gradient. We report the first successful US case of four MitraClip
implantation for the treatment of severe primary MR by "anchoring" flail
segments.

BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose reduction 
or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead to rejection and
possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known about what factors might
cause or contribute to MDR. Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is
emerging as an important, novel domain of risk in kidney transplantation
recipients. We hypothesized that frailty, an inflammatory phenotype, might be
associated with MDR.
METHODS: We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical
activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor characteristics,
longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 kidney transplantation recipients. 
Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: By 2 years after transplantation, 54% of frail recipients and 45% of
nonfrail recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67% and 51%. Frail
recipients were 1.29 times (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.66; P =
0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased donor recipients (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.44-2.54, P < 0.001) and older adults (age ≥
65 vs <65; aHR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.96, P = 0.01). Mycophenolate mofetil dose
reduction was independently associated with a substantially increased risk of
death-censored graft loss (aHR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.97-13.98, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A better understanding of risk factors for MMF intolerance might help
in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression and
prolong allograft survival.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Testosterone among Patients with End-Stage Renal
Disease.

The prevalence of low testosterone level is particularly high among patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been associated with mortality. In
populations without ESRD, low testosterone level has also been associated with a 
number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low
muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty. However, there
is controversy regarding what constitutes low testosterone level in the aging
population and at what level replacement therapy with testosterone is indicated. 
There are no randomized controlled trials investigating long-term outcomes of
testosterone replacement therapy in populations with or without ESRD. Available
trial results suggest equivocal improvements in sexual function. Muscle mass and 
bone mineral density appear to improve, but results in physical function and
performance are mixed and there are no data on fracture prevention. Some recent
data suggest harm when testosterone was given to men with limited mobility.
Finally, there is little evidence that testosterone adds to existing
erythropoietin agents in the treatment of anemia in ESRD. Due to lack of evidence
supporting long-term use of testosterone, the authors recommend against the
routine use of testosterone in ESRD patients with low testosterone levels.
Testosterone treatment can be considered in those with low bone mass and total
testosterone level <200 ng/dl, or in younger patients with sexual complaints with
total testosterone level lower than the reference range. It is important to
engage patients in discussion of risks and benefits before initiating
testosterone therapy; testosterone therapy should be discontinued if the intended
treatment effect is not observed after short-term use.

We have previously described strong associations between frailty, a measure of
physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, and early
hospital readmission as well as delayed graft function. The goal of this study
was to estimate its association with postkidney transplantation (post-KT)
mortality. Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of
transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional hazards
models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to substantially
improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We
precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of
the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients (n = 37 858) and introduced
these into the single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty
coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5%, 86.0% and 77.5% for nonfrail, 
intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was
independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.01-4.65, p = 0.047) higher
risk of death. In conclusion, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent
risk factor for post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many
confounders using a novel, efficient statistical approach.

Renal functional reserve and renal recovery after acute kidney injury.

Sharma A(1), Mucino MJ, Ronco C.

Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.

Renal functional reserve (RFR) represents the capacity of the kidney to increase 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to certain physiological or
pathological stimuli or conditions. Once baseline GFR is determined, RFR can be
assessed clinically after an oral protein load or intravenous amino acid
infusion. In clinical practice, baseline GFR displays variable levels due to diet
or other factors. RFR is the difference between peak 'stress' GFR induced by the 
test (p.o. or i.v.) and the baseline GFR. In clinical scenarios where
hyperfiltration is present (high baseline GFR due to pregnancy, hypertension or
diabetic nephropathy, in solitary kidney or kidney donors), RFR may be fully or
partially used to achieve normal or supranormal renal function. Since commonly
used renal function markers, such as GFR, may remain within normal ranges until
50% of nephrons are lost or in patients with a single remnant kidney, the RFR
test may represent a sensitive and early way to assess the functional decline in 
the kidney. RFR assessment may become an important tool to evaluate the ability
of the kidney to recover completely or partially after a kidney attack. In case
of healing with a defect and progressive fibrosis, recovery may appear complete
clinically, but a reduced RFR may be a sign of a maladaptive repair or
subclinical loss of renal mass. Thus, a reduction in RFR may represent the
equivalent of renal frailty or susceptibility to insults. The main aim of this
article is to review the concept of RFR, its utility in different clinical
scenarios, and future perspective for its use.

This paper presents an extension of the joint modeling strategy for the case of
multiple longitudinal outcomes and repeated infections of different types over
time, motivated by postkidney transplantation data. Our model comprises two parts
linked by shared latent terms. On the one hand is a multivariate mixed linear
model with random effects, where a low-rank thin-plate spline function is
incorporated to collect the nonlinear behavior of the different profiles over
time. On the other hand is an infection-specific Cox model, where the dependence 
between different types of infections and the related times of infection is
through a random effect associated with each infection type to catch the within
dependence and a shared frailty parameter to capture the dependence between
infection types. We implemented the parameterization used in joint models which
uses the fitted longitudinal measurements as time-dependent covariates in a
relative risk model. Our proposed model was implemented in OpenBUGS using the
MCMC approach.

Clinical relevance of sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis.

The most commonly recognized complications in cirrhotic patients include ascites,
hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, susceptibility for infections, kidney 
dysfunction, and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, severe muscle wasting or
sarcopenia are the most common and frequently unseen complications which
negatively impact survival, quality of life, and response to stressor, such as
infections and surgeries. At present, D'Amico stage classification, Child-Pugh,
and MELD scores constitute the best tools to predict mortality in patients with
cirrhosis; however, one of their main limitations is the lack of assessing the
nutritional and functional status. Currently, numerous methods are available to
evaluate the nutrition status of the cirrhotic patient; nevertheless, most of
these techniques have limitations primarily because lack of objectivity,
reproducibility, and prognosis discrimination. In this regard, an objective and
reproducible technique, such as muscle mass quantification with cross-sectional
imaging studies (computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging)
constitute an attractive index of nutritional status in cirrhosis. Sarcopenia is 
part of the frailty complex present in cirrhotic patients, resulting from
cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and characterized by
impaired functional capacity, decreased reserve, resistance to stressors, and
predisposition to poor outcomes. In this review, we discuss the current accepted 
and new methods to evaluate prognosis in cirrhosis. Also, we analyze the current 
knowledge regarding incidence and clinical impact of malnutrition and sarcopenia 
in patients with cirrhosis and their impact after liver transplantation. Finally,
we discuss existing and potential novel therapeutic approaches for malnutrition
in cirrhosis, emphasizing the recognition of sarcopenia in an effort to reduced
morbidity related and improved survival in cirrhosis.

Hemodialysis (HD) is routinely offered to patients with end-stage renal disease
in the United States who are ineligible for other renal replacement modalities.
The frequency of HD among the US population is greater than all other countries, 
except Taiwan and Japan. In US, patients are often dialyzed irrespective of age, 
comorbidities, prognosis, or decision-making capacity. Determination of when
patients can no longer dialyze is variable and can be dialysis-center specific.
Determinants may be related to progressive comorbidities and frailty, mobility or
access issues, patient self-determination, or an inability to tolerate the
treatment safely for any number of reasons (e.g., hypotension, behavioral
issues). Behavioral issues may impact the safety of not only patients themselves,
but also those around them. In this article the authors present the case of an
elderly patient on HD with progressive cognitive impairment and combative
behavior placing him and others at risk of physical harm. The authors discuss the
medical, ethical, legal, and psychosocial challenges to care of such patients who
lack decision-making capacity with a focus on variable approaches by regions and 
culture. This manuscript provides recommendations and highlights resources to
assist nephrologists, dialysis personnel, ethics consultants, and palliative
medicine teams in managing such patients to resolve conflict.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors can minimize the hypoglycaemic burden and

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among elderly people is
increasing. Often associated with disabilities/comorbidities, T2DM lowers the
chances of successful aging and is independently associated with frailty and an
increased risk of hypoglycaemia, which can be further exacerbated by
antihyperglycaemic treatment. From this perspective, the clinical management of
T2DM in the elderly is challenging and requires individualization of optimum
glycaemic targets depending on comorbidities, cognitive functioning and ability
to recognize and self-manage the disease. The lack of solid evidence-based
medicine supporting treatment guidelines for older people with diabetes further
complicates the matter. Several classes of medicine for the treatment of T2DM are
currently available and different drug combinations are often required to achieve
individualized glycaemic goals. Many of these drugs, however, carry disadvantages
such as the propensity to cause weight gain or hypoglycaemia. Dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, a recent addition to the pharmacological
armamentarium, have become widely accepted in clinical practice because of their 
efficacy, low risk of hypoglycaemia, neutral effect on body weight, and
apparently greater safety in patients with kidney failure. Although more
information is needed to reach definitive conclusions, growing evidence suggests 
that DPP-4 inhibitors may become a valuable component in the pharmacological
management of elderly people with T2DM. The present review aims to delineate the 
potential advantages of this pharmacological approach in the treatment of elderly
people with T2DM.

BACKGROUND: A well-accepted definition of frailty includes measurements of
physical performance, which may limit its clinical utility.
STUDY DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, we compared prevalence and patient
characteristics based on a frailty definition that uses self-reported function to
the classic performance-based definition and developed a modified
self-report-based definition.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prevalent adult patients receiving hemodialysis in 14
centers around San Francisco and Atlanta in 2009-2011.
INDEX TESTS: Self-report-based frailty definition in which a score lower than 75 
on the Physical Function scale of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)
was substituted for gait speed and grip strength in the classic definition;
modified self-report definition with optimized Physical Function score cutoff
points derived in a development (one-half) cohort and validated in the other
half.
REFERENCE TEST: Performance-based frailty defined as 3 of the following: weight
loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed.
RESULTS: 387 (53%) patients were frail based on self-reported function, of whom
209 (29% of the cohort) met the performance-based definition. Only 23 (3%) met
the performance-based definition of frailty only. The self-report definition had 
90% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 54% positive predictive value, 93% negative
predictive value, and 72.5% overall accuracy. Intracellular water per kilogram of
body weight and serum albumin, prealbumin, and creatinine levels were highest
among nonfrail individuals, intermediate among those who were frail by
self-report, and lowest among those who also were frail by performance. Age,
percentage of body fat, and C-reactive protein level followed an opposite
pattern. The modified self-report definition had better accuracy (84%; 95% CI,
79%-89%) and superior specificity (88%) and positive predictive value (67%).
LIMITATIONS: Our study did not address prediction of outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the self-report-based but not the
performance-based definition of frailty may represent an intermediate phenotype. 
A modified self-report definition can improve the accuracy of a
questionnaire-based method of defining frailty.

BACKGROUND: Although individuals with kidney disease, including those dependent
on dialysis, often present clinically with signs and symptoms consistent with
frailty, there is limited information about sociodemographic and clinical risk
factors that may be associated.
METHODS: Seven hundred forty-five patients undergoing hemodialysisbetween 2009
and 2011 in 7 Atlanta dialysis clinics and 7 San Francisco bay area dialysis
clinics were assessed using the validated Fried frailty index (recent
unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk
speed, low physical activity) that defines frailty as the presence of 3 or more
criteria. Study coordinators interviewed participants; measured grip strength,
walk speed, and body composition; and reviewed records for clinical and
laboratory parameters. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the
association of patient characteristics with frailty.
RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, peripheral vascular disease and cardiac diseases, 
including dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, pericarditis, and
cardiac arrest, were associated with higher odds for frailty, whereas black race 
and higher serum albumin concentration were associated with lower odds for
frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: In multivariable analyses, the risk for frailty in patients
undergoing hemodialysis, as assessed by the presence of 3 or more criteria that
comprise the Fried frailty index, was increased in association with peripheral
vascular disease and cardiac conditions, such as dysrhythmia and atrial
fibrillation, and was decreased for those with higher serum albumin concentration
and for blacks compared with whites. Among patients who met the Fried definition 
of frailty, 78% scored as frail on walk speed and 56% scored as frail on grip
strength, the 2 physical performance measures.

The equations for estimating kidney function have become very popular in the last
decade. However, the clinical and prognostic meaning of these measures may be
very different in older populations. Two cohorts of people aged 65-89 years
(older sample) and 90 or more (oldest old sample) were used to investigate the
prognostic significance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
Additionally, we also investigated whether combining frailty and eGFR may improve
the accuracy of frailty in predicting mortality. We found that lower eGFR values 
were significantly more frequent among frail subjects in both groups. eGFR < 30
was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality either in subjects
aged 65-89 years (HR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.23-11.2) or in those aged 90 or more
(HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.05-2.23). In the latter group, a not significant trend for
increasing mortality was also observed among people with eGFR > 60 (HR = 1.28,
95% CI = 0.72-2.26). In addition, the oldest old subjects with eGFR > 60 and
eGFR < 30 had the lowest hand-grip strength and ADL values. Combining eGFR and
frailty status significantly improved the accuracy of frailty in predicting
mortality only in the older sample. In conclusion, a U-shaped relationship exists
between eGFR and mortality in the oldest old, but not in older individuals. Our
findings suggest that eGFR needs to be adjusted for muscle mass/physical
performance when estimating kidney function in people aged 90 or more.
Nevertheless, in subjects aged 65-89 years, eGFR may improve the accuracy of
frailty status in predicting prognosis, thus suggesting that eGFR may represent
an additional dimension of frailty syndrome.

Center, Baltimore VA Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in 
individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on 
their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of
cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that
highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid
conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating
cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including
microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally,
studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected
in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with
worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk
of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible
short-term effects on markers of physical performance.
SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to 
better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with occlusive or aneurysmal vascular disease are repeatedly 
exposed to intravascular (IV) contrast for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. We
sought to determine the long-term impact of cumulative iodinated IV contrast
exposure (CIVCE) on renal function; the latter was defined by means of National
Kidney Foundation (NKF) criteria.
METHODS: We performed a longitudinal study of consecutive patients without renal 
insufficiency at baseline (NFK stage I or II) who underwent interventions for
arterial occlusive or aneurysmal disease. We collected detailed data on any IV
iodinated contrast exposure (including diagnostic or therapeutic angiography,
cardiac catheterization, IV pyelography, computed tomography with IV contrast,
computed tomographic angiography); medication exposure throughout the observation
period; comorbidities; and demographics. The primary end point was the
development of renal failure (RF) (defined as NFK stage 4 or 5). Analysis was
performed with the use of a shared frailty model with clustering at the patient
level.
RESULTS: Patients (n = 1274) had a mean follow-up of 5.8 (range, 2.2-14) years.
In the multivariate model with RF as the dependent variable and after adjusting
for the statistically significant covariates of baseline renal function (hazard
ratio [HR], 0.95; P < .001), diabetes (HR, 1.8; P = .007), use of an
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (HR, 0.63; P = .03), use of antiplatelets
(HR, 0.5; P = .01), cumulative number of open vascular operations performed (HR, 
1.2; P = .001), and congestive heart failure (HR, 3.2; P < .001), CIVCE remained 
an independent predictor for RF development (HR, 1.1; P < .001). In the
multivariate survival analysis model and after adjusting for the statistically
significant covariates of perioperative myocardial infarction (HR, 3.9; P <
.001), age at entry in the cohort (HR, 1.05; P = .035), total number of open
operations (HR, 1.51; P < .001), and serum albumin (HR, 0.47; P < .001), CIVCE
was an independent predictor of death (HR, 1.07; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative IV contrast exposure is an independent predictor of RF
and death in patients with occlusive and aneurysmal vascular disease.

Thoughtful decision-making in a patient with cancer and kidney disease requires a
comprehensive discussion of prognosis and therapy options for both conditions
framed by the individual's preferences and goals of care. An estimate of overall 
prognosis is generated that includes the patient's clinical presentation and
parameters associated with adverse outcomes, such as age, performance status,
frailty, malnutrition, and comorbidities. Empathic communication of this
information using a shared decision-making approach can lead to an informed
decision that respects patient autonomy and is consistent with the patient's
"big-picture" goals and personal values.

Uric acid (UA) is produced from purines by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, and
elevated levels may cause arthritis and kidney stones. Conversely, UA also
appears to function as an antioxidant and may protect against the oxidative
stress associated with aging and disease. We performed a prospective fracture
case-cohort study to understand the relation of UA and fracture risk in older men
enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. In the cohort of 5994
men aged 65 years and older attending the baseline MrOS examination, we evaluated
a subgroup 1680 men in a case-cohort study design. The analytic group included
387 men with incident nonspine fractures (73 hip) and a random sample of 1383.
Serum UA was measured in baseline serum samples. Modified proportional hazards
models that account for case-cohort study design were used to estimate the
relative hazards (RH) of hip and nonspine fracture in men for serum UA. Models
were adjusted for age, race, clinic site, body mass index, vitamin D, parathyroid
hormone, walking speed, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score,
frailty, and total. Subjects with incident nonspine fractures were older, had
lower total hip bone mineral density (BMD), and higher serum phosphorus. There
was an 18% decreased risk of nonspine fractures (95% confidence interval [CI]
0.71-0.93; p = 0.003) per 1 SD increase of baseline serum and 34% decreased risk 
of nonspine fractures in quartile 4 of UA versus quartiles 1, 2, and 3 (95% CI
0.49-0.89; p = 0.028) compared with nonfracture cases after multivariate
adjustment. Hip fractures were not significantly associated with UA. Total hip
BMD was significantly higher in the group of men with high UA levels compared
with lower UA levels and increased linearly across quartiles of UA after
multivariate adjustment (p for trend = 0.002). In summary, higher serum UA levels
were associated with a reduction in risk of incident nonspine fractures but not
hip fractures and higher hip BMD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Kidney disease is associated with physiologic changes 
that may predispose to frailty. This study sought to investigate whether lower
levels of kidney function were associated with prevalent or incident frailty in
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) participants.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: CHS enrolled community-dwelling
adults age ≥65 years between 1989-1990 and 1992-1993. To examine prevalent
frailty, included were 4150 participants without stroke, Parkinson disease,
prescribed medications for Alzheimer disease or depression, or severely impaired 
cognition. To examine incident frailty, included were a subset of 3459
participants without baseline frailty or development of exclusion criteria during
follow-up. The primary predictor was estimated GFR (eGFR) calculated using serum 
cystatin C (eGFR(cys)). Secondary analyses examined eGFR using serum creatinine
(eGFR(SCr)). Outcomes were prevalent frailty and incident frailty at 4 years of
follow-up. Frailty was ascertained on the basis of weight loss, exhaustion,
weakness, slowness, and low physical activity.
RESULTS: The mean age was 75 years and the median eGFR(cys) was 73 ml/min per
1.73 m(2). Among participants with an eGFR(cys) <45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), 24% had
prevalent frailty. In multivariable analysis and compared with eGFR(cys) ≥90
ml/min per 1.73 m(2), eGFR(cys) categories of 45-59 (odds ratio [OR], 1.80; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.17 to 2.75) and 15-44 (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.72 to
4.77) were associated with higher odds of frailty, whereas 60-75 (OR, 1.14; 95%
CI, 0.76 to 1.70) was not. In multivariable analysis, eGFR(cys) categories of
60-75 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.75) and 15-44 (IRR,
2.28; 95% CI, 1.23 to 4.22) were associated with higher incidence of frailty
whereas 45-59 (IRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.90 to 2.60) was not. Lower levels of
eGFR(SCr) were not associated with higher risk of prevalent or incident frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: In community-dwelling elders, lower eGFR(cys) was associated with a 
higher risk of prevalent and incident frailty whereas lower eGFR(SCr) was not.
These findings highlight the importance of considering non-GFR determinants of
kidney function.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical
function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness
and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a
heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of
this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general
population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science,
CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD
and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text
review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. 
From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in
patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with
increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. 
In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher 
risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished
physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may 
lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to
understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with
clinical outcomes.

Although the management of diabetes as a simple entity has been extensively
developed, there is a dearth of evidence in elderly, frail patients with multiple
comorbidities and polymedication. This population represents a large proportion
of the residents of nursing homes (NHs). As a multidisciplinary group of French
experts (geriatricians, endocrinologists, diabetologists, and general
practitioners) with practical experience in this area, which is growing in
magnitude throughout the world, we convened to compile pragmatic, simple advice
on the management of elderly, frail diabetic patients. Given demands on NH
personnel (manager, medical coordinator, nurses, and, at the front line of care
provision, the undertrained and overworked carers), coupled with the
quasiconstant of high staff turnover, the foundation stone of a patient's
diabetes management is an Individual Care Plan (ICP) expressed in layman's
language. This document that is opened on the patient's admission aims to make
sure that the prescriptions established at admission are followed, notably to
ensure correct treatment and adapted, regular monitoring with dates and times
when examinations and tests are due. This includes monitoring of the diabetes
control (HbA1c and, if necessary, blood and urine glucose) and its complications 
(cardiovascular disease, hypoglycemia, ocular problems, foot disorders,
malnutrition, peripheral neuropathy, kidney failure). A necessary corollary is
the training of staff to understand the specificities of caring for a frail
patient with diabetes, on what to do in a potential emergency, and how to keep
the ICP up to date for consultation by doctors and nurses.

BACKGROUND: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated
risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly
associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and
frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established.
METHODS: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test
of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of
frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting
for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for
the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty
status.
RESULTS: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49
(36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of
participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for 
eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61
points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all
comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p
= 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated with worse frailty
status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).
CONCLUSIONS: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and
frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD
patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted
interventions.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether higher cystatin C would be associated with
greater frailty in men aged 65 and older.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study.
SETTING: Six U.S. sites.
PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of community-dwelling men aged 65 and older
enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study (mean age 73.8; 9.8%
frail and 47.2% intermediate frailty; N = 1,602).
MEASUREMENTS: Serum cystatin C, creatinine, and frailty were measured. Frailty
was analyzed as an ordinal outcome of robust, intermediate frailty, and frail
using a multinomial logistic regression model, and the base model was adjusted
for age, race, and clinical site.
RESULTS: Higher cystatin C was associated with seven times greater odds of being 
frail than being robust (odds ratio (OR) quartile 4 vs 1 = 7.12, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 3.76-13.46) and 2.4 times greater odds of intermediate frailty
than robust (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.70-3.32). The association was 
attenuated but persisted after adjusting for multiple possible confounders. In
contrast, neither higher serum creatinine (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.36, 95% CI =
0.78-2.40) nor lower creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR
quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.54-1.87) was associated in a graded manner
with greater odds of frailty.
CONCLUSION: Higher cystatin C, but not creatinine-based measures, was associated 
with greater odds of frailty in this cohort of older men.

Evidence has recently been building that the presence of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is an independent contributor to decline in physical and cognitive
functions in older adults. CKD affects 45% of persons older than 70 years of age 
and can double the risk for physical impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and
frailty. To increase awareness of this relatively new concept of CKD as a risk
factor for accelerated aging, we review studies on the association of CKD with
physical function, frailty, and cognitive function. We also present a summary of 
the proposed mechanisms for these associations.

An appropriate treatment of elderly rheumatic patients implements comprehensive
diagnostics and exclusion diagnostics of e.g. coronary heart disease,
osteoporosis, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2 and thyroid gland
dysfunction. Furthermore, the complex disease situation might require the
integration of other faculties or might be a reason for inpatient treatment. The 
complexity in the treatment of multimorbid elderly patients suffering from
rheumatism not only rises with increasing age but also constitutes a considerable
challenge due to existing incapacities and preceding as well as currently
performed immunosuppressive therapies. The necessary treatment framework is
outlined from the perspective of rheumatologists and geriatricians. Typical
geriatric symptoms, such as malnutrition, immobility and frailty might be
enhanced if multimorbidity is simultaneously present.

Bone fracture risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher
than that in healthy subjects. Frailty caused by neuromuscular impairment as well
as bone fragility due to bone loss and impaired bone quality is thought to be
involved in the elevated fracture risk in CKD. Altered material and structural
properties might be attributed to the reduced bone strength. The structural
properties in CKD patients are characterized in 1) cortical thinning and cortical
porosity, and 2) irregular thickening and loss of connectivity in trabecular
bone. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that skeletal changes in the
structural properties may be initiated at earlier stage of CKD than we expected.

Early hospital readmission (EHR) after kidney transplantation (KT) is associated 
with increased morbidity and higher costs. Registry-based recipient, transplant
and center-level predictors of EHR are limited, and novel predictors are needed. 
We hypothesized that frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve initially
described and validated in geriatrics and recently associated with early KT
outcomes, might serve as a novel, independent predictor of EHR in KT recipients
of all ages. We measured frailty in 383 KT recipients at Johns Hopkins Hospital. 
EHR was ascertained from medical records as ≥1 hospitalization within 30 days of 
initial post-KT discharge. Frail KT recipients were much more likely to
experience EHR (45.8% vs. 28.0%, p = 0.005), regardless of age. After adjusting
for previously described registry-based risk factors, frailty independently
predicted 61% higher risk of EHR (adjusted RR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.18-2.19, p =
0.002). In addition, frailty improved EHR risk prediction by improving the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (p = 0.01) as well as the net
reclassification index (p = 0.04). Identifying frail KT recipients for targeted
outpatient monitoring and intervention may reduce EHR rates.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and outcomes in patients undergoing
transvenous transseptal (TS) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
BACKGROUND: TS approach for TAVR was abandoned in favor of retrograde
transfemoral, transaortic, or transapical approaches. TS TAVR may still be
warranted in patients for whom no other approach is feasible.
METHODS: Observational consecutive case series at a single center, to evaluate
technical outcomes in inoperable patients with aortic stenosis who had
contraindications for other approaches and who underwent TAVR via a transvenous
TS antegrade approach using the Edwards-Sapien (ES) valve.
RESULTS: Over a 4-month period, 9 patients underwent TS TAVR with 26 mm (n = 4)
and 23 mm (n = 5) ES valves. Mean age was 84.5 ± 6.6 years and Society of
Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality was 7.8 ± 2.8%. Specific
contraindications for other access included iliofemoral arterial diameter <7 mm
in 9 (100%), porcelain aorta in 6 (66%) patients, multiple (≥2) sternotomies in 2
(22%) patients, severe pulmonary disease in 3 (33%), extreme frailty in 1 (11%), 
spinal stenosis with impaired ability to rehabilitate postsurgery in 1 (11%) and 
apical left ventricular thrombus in 1 (11%) patient. Antegrade deployment of the 
ES prosthetic valve was technically feasible in 8 patients. Major bleeding
occurred in 4 patients, two patients suffered acute kidney injury without need
for dialysis and one patient required a permanent pacemaker. The median (25th,
75th percentiles) fluoroscopy time was 49 (34, 81) minutes and contrast volume
was 150 (120, 225) ml. No patient had hemodynamically significant post-TAVR
aortic insufficiency nor damage to the mitral valve. At 6 months follow-up, there
were no cerebrovascular events or rehospitalizations and mean NYHA Class improved
from 3.4 to 1.7.
CONCLUSIONS: The antegrade TS approach to TAVR is a technically feasible option
for "no-access" patients. Prospective assessment of the safety and efficacy of
this approach in the current era warrants further study.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Uromodulin-associated kidney disease (UAKD) is an
autosomal dominant disease caused by uromodulin (UMOD) gene mutations. This study
explored genotype-phenotype correlations by examining the relationship between
the type of UMOD mutation and the age at onset of ESRD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: Extensive bibliographic research
was used to ascertain patient-level data of all patients with UAKD published up
to October 2011. Data included sex; ages at onset of hyperuricemia, gout, and
ESRD; and UMOD genotype. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards
models fitted with shared gamma frailty terms to adjust for within-family
correlations were used to model time to event.
RESULTS: Thirty-one peer-reviewed publications reporting on 202 patients from 74 
families with 59 different UMOD mutations were included. Median ages at onset of 
hyperuricemia, gout, and ESRD were 24, 40, and 56 years, respectively. Men
developed gout and ESRD significantly earlier than did women (age at ESRD was 50 
years for men and 60 for women; P=0.04, shared frailty model). Median ages at
ESRD development were lowest with Cys77Tyr (37.5 years) and highest with
Gln316Pro (65.5 years) UMOD mutations. Onset of ESRD was significantly earlier
with UMOD mutations located within the epidermal growth factor domains 2 and 3
(range, 45-52 years; P<0.01 and 0.04, respectively) compared with the
cysteine-rich domains (range, 60-65 years; by shared frailty model).
CONCLUSIONS: The UMOD genotype is related to the clinical phenotype of UAKD. This
finding may assist in counseling of patients.

CKD is associated with impairments in health status, physical function, and
frailty. The aim of the current prospective cohort study was to determine whether
CKD predicted new LTCI need certification among community-dwelling older Japanese
adults. This was a prospective cohort study. We analyzed the cohort data from a
prospective study, The Japan Multicenter Aging Cohort for Care Prevention
(J-MACC). We followed 8063 elderly adults for 2 years, and we analyzed the
relationship between CKD and LTCI need. The outcome studied was new certification
for LTCI service need during a 2-year period. We measured serum creatinine (the
estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR), serum albumin, frailty checklist
scores, and body mass index. During the 2-year follow-up, 536 subjects (6.6%)
were newly certified as needing LTCI services. We stratified the cohort according
to eGFR quartile and performed multivariate analyses using an eGFR value of
71.4-83.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) as a reference. We found that subjects with eGFR
values <60.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) had a significantly elevated risk of LTCI service
need (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.44 [95% CI 1.12-1.86]). Our results indicate that 
CKD is independently associated with new LTCI service need certification and is
an important marker of frailty in older adults.

Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of
Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and
catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate
with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and
provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of
PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology
of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition)
due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent 
factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include
uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent
inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of
hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition,
comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the
dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW.

We present the case and radiologic images of an 85-year-old woman who presented
with a left loin abscess secondary to a left staghorn calculus and a
nonfunctioning left kidney. We examined the rationale behind the eventual
decision to pursue conservative treatment in the form of incision and drainage
rather than nephrectomy. This was because of the patient's frailty and the
presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in close proximity to the left kidney.
The radiologic images are of great quality and interest because they display the 
pathologic findings very clearly. Our brief case report outlines the
decision-making process.

BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in management have been highlighted as contributory
factors in the death of many patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). However,
there is little evidence addressing the quality of care provided to patients with
milder AKI.
AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of care provided to a
non-select cohort of patients with AKI and evaluate discrepancies in causation,
recognition and management.
DESIGN: Retrospective inception cohort study.
METHODS: Demographic data were collected for all 1577 patients admitted to a
University Teaching Hospital during a 1-month period. Baseline, admission and
peak creatinine were correlated with mortality and length of hospital admission. 
AKI was classified according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
criteria. A retrospective case note review of all patients with AKI was carried
out to evaluate quality of documentation and clinical management of AKI.
Multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors for AKI.
RESULTS: Incidence of AKI on admission was 4.6%. A further 10.3% developed AKI
while in hospital. All cause mortality was 4-fold higher among patients with AKI 
compared with those without (19 vs. 3.8%; P < 0.001). Mortality was significantly
higher in those patients who developed AKI while an in-patient compared with
those with AKI on admission (27.3 vs. 11.8%; P < 0.001). Diabetes, clinician
perception of frailty, age and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor prior to admission were found to be independent risk factors for AKI.
AKI was unrecognized in 23.5% of patients, two-thirds of whom were discharged
without resolution of renal function. Significant weaknesses in management were
poorly kept fluid balance charts (48.2%), failure to withhold nephrotoxic drugs
(38.8%) and failure to act upon abnormal biochemistry (41%) in a timely fashion.
CONCLUSION: AKI is common in hospitalized patients and associated with a
significant increase in hospital stay and mortality. AKI is often found in
conjunction with other organ failure and in many cases is not preventable.
Nevertheless clinicians need to be more vigilant of small creatinine rises to
permit early intervention particularly among elderly and frail patients.

Older people constitute an increasingly greater proportion of patients with
advanced CKD, including those patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment.
Frailty is a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors
that results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and
causes vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty is common in elderly CKD
patients, and it may be associated with protein-energy wasting (PEW), sarcopenia,
dynapenia, and other complications of CKD. Causes of frailty with or without PEW 
in the elderly with CKD can be classified into three categories: causes primarily
caused by aging per se, advanced CKD per se, or a combination of both conditions.
Frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients are associated with impaired physical
performance, disability, poorer quality of life, and reduced survival. Prevention
and treatment of these conditions in the elderly CKD patients often require a
multifaceted approach. Here, we examine the causes and consequences of these
conditions and examine the interplay between frailty and PEW in elderly CKD
patients.

Though bone loss tends to accelerate with age there are modifiable factors that
may influence the rate of bone loss even in very old men.INTRODUCTION: The aim of
this 2-year longitudinal study was to examine potential predictors of change in
total hip bone mineral density (BMD) in older men.
METHODS: The Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project is a population-based study
in Sydney, Australia. For this study, 1,122 men aged 70-97 years had baseline and
follow-up measures of total hip BMD measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry. Data
about mobility, muscle strength, balance, medication use, cognition, medical
history and lifestyle factors were collected using questionnaires and clinical
assessments. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was also measured. Multivariate 
linear regression models were used to assess relationships between baseline
predictors and change in BMD.
RESULTS: Over a mean of 2.2 years, there was a mean annualised loss of total hip 
BMD of 0.006 g/cm(2)/year (0.6 %) and hip BMC of 0.14 g/year (0.3 %). Annual BMD 
loss accelerated with increasing age, from 0.4 % in men aged between 70 and 75
years, to 1.2 % in men aged 85+ years. In multivariate regression models,
predictors of faster BMD loss were anti-androgen, thiazolidinedione and
loop-diuretic medications, kidney disease, poor dynamic balance, larger hip bone 
area, older age and lower serum 25(OH)D. Factors associated with attenuated bone 
loss were walking for exercise and use of beta-blocker medications. Change in BMD
was not associated with baseline BMD, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, frailty,
or osteoarthritis.
CONCLUSION: There was considerable variation in the rate of hip bone loss in
older men. Walking, better balance and beta blockers may attenuate the
acceleration of BMD loss that occurs with age.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor is
recommended for use as first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary
syndromes (ACS) who undergo high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention.
However, revascularization may not be a beneficial option for some subgroups of
patients with ACS. This includes a broad spectrum of lower risk patients as well 
as high-risk patients with numerous previous revascularizations and those who are
at high risk for complications, such as those with complex coronary anatomy and
co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or advanced age
and frailty. For such patients, there remains an unmet need for evaluation of
alternatives to the currently recommended treatment options. Notably, there is a 
paucity of prospective data regarding management approaches to medically managed 
patients with ACS. Thus, this group of medically managed patients with ACS would 
benefit from inclusion in clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for
patients not scheduled to undergo invasive procedures, such as those who are
targeted for pharmacologic management only. In conclusion, in this review, the
investigators revisit data from clinical studies of dual-antiplatelet therapy in 
ACS to highlight areas of unmet need in antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS
and to examine the use of newer agents in subgroups, such as medically managed
patients with ACS, that would potentially benefit from more potent platelet
inhibition after ACS.

Next to a high morbidity, patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) suffer
from a complex spectrum of clinical manifestations. Both the phenotype of
patients with ESRD as well as the pathophysiology of uremia show interesting
parallels with the general aging process. Phenotypically, patients with ESRD have
an increased susceptibility for both cardiovascular as well as infectious disease
and show a reduction in functional capacity as well as muscular mass
(sarcopenia), translating into a high prevalence of frailty also in younger
patients. Pathophysiologically, the immune dysfunction, telomere attrition and
the presence of low-grade inflammation in uremic patients also show parallels
with the aging process. System models of aging, such as the homeodynamic model
and reliability theory of Gavrilov may also have relevance for ESRD. The
reduction in the redundancy of compensatory mechanisms and the multisystem
impairment in ESRD explain the rapid loss of homeodynamic/homeostatic balance and
the increased susceptibility to external stressors in these patients. System
theories may also explain the relative lack of success of interventions focusing 
on single aspects of renal disease. The concept of accelerated aging, which also 
shares similarities with other organ diseases, may be of relevance both for a
better understanding of the uremic process, as well as for the design of
multidimensional interventions in ESRD patients, including an important role for 
early rehabilitation. Research into processes akin to both aging and uremia may
result in novel therapeutic approaches.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the impact of frailty in older adults
undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for symptomatic aortic
stenosis.
BACKGROUND: Frailty status impacts prognosis in older adults with heart disease; 
however, the impact of frailty on prognosis after TAVR is unknown.
METHODS: Gait speed, grip strength, serum albumin, and activities of daily living
status were collected at baseline and used to derive a frailty score among
patients who underwent TAVR procedures at a single large-volume institution. The 
cohort was dichotomized on the basis of median frailty score into frail and not
frail groups. The impact of frailty on procedural outcomes (stroke, bleeding,
vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and mortality at 30 days) and 1-year
mortality was evaluated.
RESULTS: Frailty status was assessed in 159 subjects who underwent TAVR (age 86 ±
8 years, Society of Thoracic Surgery Risk Score 12 ± 4). Baseline frailty score
was not associated with conventionally ascertained clinical variables or Society 
of Thoracic Surgery score. Although high frailty score was associated with a
longer post-TAVR hospital stay when compared with lower frailty score (9 ± 6 days
vs. 6 ± 5 days, respectively, p = 0.004), there were no significant crude
associations between frailty status and procedural outcomes, suggesting adequacy 
of the standard selection process for identifying patients at risk for
periprocedural complications after TAVR. Frailty status was independently
associated with increased 1-year mortality (hazard ratio: 3.5, 95% confidence
interval: 1.4 to 8.5, p = 0.007) after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was not associated with increased periprocedural
complications in patients selected as candidates to undergo TAVR but was
associated with increased 1-year mortality after TAVR. Further studies will
evaluate the independent value of this frailty composite in older adults with
aortic stenosis.

BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be
associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Given the high
prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD in the general population, in depth analysis
of this association is warranted.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We pooled individual participant data from 5 community-based
cohorts from Europe (second Nord-Trøndelag Health Study [HUNT2], Prevention of
Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease [PREVEND], and the Tromsø study) and the
United States (Atherosclerosis Risks in Communities [ARIC] and Cardiovascular
Health Study [CHS]) to assess the association of estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and CKD with objectively verified VTE. To estimate
adjusted hazard ratios for VTE, categorical and continuous spline models were fit
by using Cox regression with shared-frailty or random-effect meta-analysis. A
total of 1178 VTE events occurred over 599 453 person-years follow-up. Relative
to eGFR 100 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), hazard ratios for VTE were 1.29 (95% confidence
interval, 1.04-1.59) for eGFR 75, 1.31 (1.00-1.71) for eGFR 60, 1.82 (1.27-2.60) 
for eGFR 45, and 1.95 (1.26-3.01) for eGFR 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). In comparison
with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 5.0 mg/g, the hazard ratios for VTE 
were 1.34 (1.04-1.72) for ACR 30 mg/g, 1.60 (1.08-2.36) for ACR 300 mg/g, and
1.92 (1.19-3.09) for ACR 1000 mg/g. There was no interaction between clinical
categories of eGFR and ACR (P=0.20). The adjusted hazard ratio for CKD, defined
as eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or albuminuria ≥30 mg/g, (versus no CKD) was
1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.06). Associations were consistent in
subgroups according to age, sex, and comorbidities, and for unprovoked versus
provoked VTE, as well.
CONCLUSIONS: Both eGFR and ACR are independently associated with increased risk
of VTE in the general population, even across the normal eGFR and ACR ranges.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a physiological vulnerability status of the patient
which is associated with the increased number of hospitalization and death.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of frailty and its associated factors in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on conservative treatment (CT),
hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).
METHODS: Frailty was assessed in 146 patients (86 CT, 37 HD and 23 PD) and
characterized as muscle weakness and exhaustion--by the physical aspect and
vitality domains, respectively, evaluated in the SF-36 quality of life
instrument; physical inactivity--if he or she answered "never" or "hardly ever"
when asked about physical activity; and as unintentional weight loss (> 4.5 kg
per year). Patients were divided into three groups: non-fragile (NF), pre-fragile
(PF) and fragile (F). The demographic, clinical and laboratory data were
extracted from patient charts.
RESULTS: Frailty was diagnosed in 36% of patients on CT, 37.8% in HD and 47.8% in
PD. It was characterized in 36.8% of patients aged between 20 and 40 years and
40.3% of those between 41 and 60 years. Frailty was significantly associated with
the use of vitamin D (r = 0.16; p = 0.03), hemoglobin (r = -0.14; p = - 0.02) and
intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.16; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is common among patients with CKD on conservative treatment 
and dialysis, even in those who are not elderly. In the patients studied, the
phenotype of frailty was associated with no usage of vitamin D, lower serum
levels of hemoglobin and higher levels of parathyroid hormone.

BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and
its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we
hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between
earlier dialysis initiation and mortality.
METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis
Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident
patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for
vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization
through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the 
association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards
regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization.
RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73%.
In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with 
higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25-1.97]; P < .001) and time to first
hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45]; P < .001). While higher eGFR at
dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23]
per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically
significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the 
United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation.
Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier
initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described
association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.

This paper proposes an estimation procedure for the semiparametric accelerated
failure time frailty model that combines smoothing with an Expectation and
Maximization-like algorithm for estimating equations. The resulting algorithm
permits simultaneous estimation of the regression parameter, the baseline
cumulative hazard, and the parameter indexing a general frailty distribution. We 
develop novel moment-based estimators for the frailty parameter, including a
generalized method of moments estimator. Standard error estimates for all
parameters are easily obtained using a randomly weighted bootstrap procedure. For
the commonly used gamma frailty distribution, the proposed algorithm is very easy
to implement using widely available numerical methods. Simulation results
demonstrate that the algorithm performs very well in this setting. We re-analyz
several previously analyzed data sets for illustrative purposes.

BACKGROUND: Organ dysfunctions and medical complications, such as renal failure, 
liver impairment, coagulation disorders, cardiovascular and respiratory
illnesses, may hamper an adequate pain management in haematological patients.
AIM: To summarize current knowledge on pain management in hematological patients 
presenting major organ dysfunctions and comorbidity. We also attempted to provide
recommendations to optimize analgesia and to minimize side effects in the setting
of medically compromised and frail haematological patients.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literature, using relevant key words, was
conducted in PubMed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Pain in hematological patients is a common symptom and
is often multi-factorial. Most pharmacotherapeutic measures, including causal
therapies, analgesics and adjuvant agents routinely applied in pain management,
may also be used in the setting of clinical frailty and medical comorbidities;
however, comprehensive clinical and functional patient's evaluations and a
careful consideration of expected benefits and potential adverse events are
required.

Risk of herpes zoster in patients treated with long-term hemodialysis: a matched 
cohort study.

Memorial Hospital, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: The risk of herpes zoster in the dialysis population relative to the 
general population is not known. The aim of this study was to perform a
population-based cohort study to investigate the risk of herpes zoster after the 
initiation of hemodialysis therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) in Taiwan, a country with the highest incidence of ESRD in the world.
STUDY DESIGN: Matched cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health
Insurance Research Database. 843 patients who were beginning hemodialysis therapy
in 1999-2003 were included as the study cohort and 3,372 patients without ESRD
matched for age and sex were included as a comparison cohort. A multivariate
frailty Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to adjust for
confounding and compare the 6-year herpes zoster-free survival rate between these
2 cohorts.
PREDICTORS: Hemodialysis.
OUTCOMES: Herpes zoster.
RESULTS: Mean years of follow-up were 4.73 and 5.49 for the hemodialysis and
comparison cohorts, respectively. 868 patients developed herpes zoster throughout
the study period, 294 from the hemodialysis cohort and 574 from the comparison
cohort. The incidence rate of herpes zoster (73.34 events/1,000 person-year) was 
significantly higher in the hemodialysis cohort than in the control cohort (31.03
events/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for potential confounders, the
adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.72-2.27).
LIMITATIONS: We expect that some patients with mild zoster chose not to seek
medical help.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients treated with long-term hemodialysis are at
an increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population.

PURPOSE: Hydration and urinary alkalinization are essential for reducing renal
dysfunction with high dose methotrexate (HDMTX). This report presents an analysis
of institutional methods used to achieve adequate urinary alkalinization and
output for patients receiving single agent HDMTX. Renal and metabolic parameters 
of tolerance were examined.
METHODS: Medical records of adult patients receiving HDMTX during the calendar
years of 2008-2009 were retrospectively reviewed to determine the time to achieve
urine pH > 7. Number of hospital days, bicarbonate dose, ordered hydration rate, 
urine output, and urine pH were assessed. A survival analysis model was run for
time to urine pH > 7 using preadmission oral bicarbonate as a predictor variable 
and including a frailty term. Observational statistics were performed for other
parameters.
RESULTS: The analysis included 79 encounters for ten patients. Urine pH > 7 was
achieved more rapidly in patients receiving preadmission oral bicarbonate
(P = 0.012). The number of patients receiving HDMTX on the same day as admission 
was greater for those receiving preadmission oral bicarbonate (47%) in comparison
to those who did not (2%), and they spent less time in the hospital. A standard
regimen for hydration and urinary alkalinization based on this project is
reported. The nature and frequency of adverse events were as expected for this
treatment.
CONCLUSION: At our institution, the time to achieve urinary alkalinization was
reduced for patients receiving preadmission oral bicarbonate which facilitated
chemotherapy infusion on the same day as admission and decreased the number of
calendar days that patients stayed in the hospital.

How to address barriers to peritoneal dialysis in the elderly.

Cane Road, London, United Kingdom. e.a.brown@imperial.ac.uk

Older patients on dialysis have unique needs and characteristics and their
outcomes vary from that of their younger counterparts. Comparatively fewer will
start or be maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to younger patients, 
despite the fact that hemodialysis is often poorly tolerated. Barriers to PD for 
older patients include poor vision, frailty, cognitive dysfunction, accommodation
issues, and a bias from renal teams that older patients cannot do PD. The
development of assisted PD can overcome many of these barriers. The ability of
older patients to use PD as their dialysis modality should not be determined by
whether they live in an area where the nephrologist is a PD enthusiast. All
patients should be given nonbiased information so they can choose the dialysis
modality that gives them the best quality of life and suits their and their
family's lifestyle.

Recent publications not only underline the risks of age and disease during
surgery but also help us quantify the risks with greater precision. Importantly, 
patient factors often have a stronger association with postoperative mortality
than surgical factors. Important factors preoperatively are: age, American
Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) physical status, emergency surgery, and plasma
albumin concentration. There is emerging work on quantifying frailty as a further
risk factor for perioperative complication and mortality as well as need for
higher level of care after discharge from hospital. Important postoperative
complications include sepsis and kidney injury. Preventing, detecting and
managing complications and mortality is the greatest challenge facing those
caring for surgical patients, including anaesthetists. Evidence for the long term
effects of perioperative complications adds further importance to minimizing
perioperative complications. Newer approaches in patient care, particularly
co-management during the postoperative phase by different specialities are
emerging. Managing high-risk patients should also be enhanced with greater
surveillance and more rapid and appropriate response; ensuring we do not fail to 
rescue our patients.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether disease burden is associated with frailty
independent of diagnosed chronic disease and whether physiological measurements
provide greater understanding of the etiology of frailty.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand four hundred thirty-seven participants in the
Cardiovascular Health Study, 1992/93 examination (mean age 74.8 ± 4.8, 43.4%
male, 95.8% white).
MEASUREMENTS: Disease burden and frailty were tabulated using 10-point scales (0 
= healthy, 10 = unhealthy). Disease burden was the sum of measurements
characterizing the vasculature, brain, kidneys, lungs, and glucose metabolism.
Frailty was assessed using the frailty index reported by Fried. Multivariate
linear models were used to determine the association between disease burden
(predictor) and frailty (outcome).
RESULTS: Unadjusted, 1-point-higher disease burden was associated with a
0.28-point-higher frailty score (P < .001). White matter grade, forced vital
capacity, and cystatin-C were particularly strongly and significantly associated 
with frailty. Disease burden attenuated the association between frailty and age
by 29%, and disease burden and age had similar associations with frailty. Disease
burden attenuated the association between frailty and fibrinogen, Factor VIII,
and C-reactive protein by 32%, 56%, and 83%, respectively. Frailty was associated
with diagnosed depression, stroke, cognitive impairment, arthritis, and pulmonary
disease but not coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or kidney disease in
the presence of a summary of disease burden. In the adjusted model, disease
burden remained significantly associated with frailty (β = 0.11, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Disease burden was independently and significantly associated with
frailty. These results emphasize that typically unrecognized physiological
changes may contribute significantly to frailty.

BACKGROUND: In the general population, frailty, a late stage of the aging
process, predicts mortality. We investigated whether manifesting a previously
defined frailty-related phenotype (FRP) before initiating highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) affects the likelihood of developing clinical AIDS
or mortality after HAART initiation.
METHODS: Among 596 HIV-infected men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study whose
date of HAART initiation was known within ±6 months and who had an assessable FRP
status within 3 years before HAART, survival analyses were performed to assess
the effect of FRP manifestation on clinical AIDS or death after HAART.
RESULTS: In men free of AIDS before HAART, AIDS or death after HAART occurred in 
13/36 (36%) men who exhibited the FRP before HAART but only in 69/436 (16%) men
who did not (hazard ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-4.6; p < .01).
After adjusting for age, ethnicity, education, nadir CD4+ T-cell count, peak HIV 
viral load, and hemoglobin in the 3 years before HAART, having the FRP at >25% of
visits in the 3 years before HAART significantly predicted AIDS or death
(adjusted hazard ratio = 3.8; 95% confidence interval = 1.9-7.9; p < .01).
Results were unchanged when the analysis was restricted to the 335 AIDS-free men 
who were HAART responders, to the 124 men who had AIDS at HAART initiation, or to
the subsets of men for whom indices of liver and kidney function could be taken
into account.
CONCLUSION: Having a persistent frailty-like phenotype before HAART initiation
predicted a worse prognosis after HAART, independent of known risk factors.

Often, one gathers together under the denomination "peritoneal dialysis" patients
with various clinical profiles. To quantify this "heterogeneity" we analysed the 
clinical characteristics of 32,975 patients treated by dialysis at 31 December
2008 in 22 French regions, participating to the REIN registry. This
cross-sectional study confirms our initial hypothesis of a great heterogeneity of
patients' profiles in peritoneal dialysis. As in hemodialysis, there is a
gradation between modalities: from assisted continuous ambulatory peritoneal
dialysis which concerns the frailty patients to autonomous automated peritoneal
dialysis for more healthy patients, through assisted automated peritoneal
dialysis and autonomous continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.

Physical inactivity contributes to the frailty and the decline in function that
develops over time among patients with end-stage renal disease. We assessed
physical activity among 1547 ambulatory patients new to dialysis in the United
States Renal Data System Comprehensive Dialysis Study. We used a self-reporting
Human Activity Profile that included Maximal and Adjusted Activity Scores and
compared results to established norms by age and gender. Physical activity was
found to be extremely low with scores for all age and gender categories below the
5th percentile of healthy individuals and 95% of patients had scores consonant
with low fitness. Older age, female gender, diabetes, atherosclerotic disease,
and a low level of education were associated with lower activity scores assessed 
by univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis. Higher serum albumin,
creatinine, and lower body mass index, but not hemoglobin levels, were associated
with greater physical activity. By multivariable analysis, patients on
hemodialysis using a catheter reported lower levels of physical activity compared
to those on peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis using an arteriovenous fistula, or 
with a graft. Lower Maximal and Adjusted Activity Scores were associated with
poor physical function and mental health. Hence, physical activity is
distressingly low among patients new to dialysis. Thus, strategies to enhance
activity in these patients should be explored.

Thyroid hormone abnormalities and frailty in elderly patients with chronic kidney
disease: a hypothesis.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults,
affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are
encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap
with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder 
may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded
in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed 
to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is
being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization
and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low
testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of
whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly
CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In
this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone
abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with
CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors 
predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and
treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
importance.

Summary In this article, we propose a positive stable shared frailty Cox model
for clustered failure time data where the frailty distribution varies with
cluster-level covariates. The proposed model accounts for covariate-dependent
intracluster correlation and permits both conditional and marginal inferences. We
obtain marginal inference directly from a marginal model, then use a stratified
Cox-type pseudo-partial likelihood approach to estimate the regression
coefficient for the frailty parameter. The proposed estimators are consistent and
asymptotically normal and a consistent estimator of the covariance matrix is
provided. Simulation studies show that the proposed estimation procedure is
appropriate for practical use with a realistic number of clusters. Finally, we

Nephrologists care for an increasing number of elderly patients on hemodialysis. 
As such, an understanding of the overlap among complications of hemodialysis and 
geriatric syndromes is crucial. This article reviews hemodialysis management
issues including vascular access, hypertension, anemia and bone and mineral
disorders with an attention towards the distinct medical needs of the elderly.
Key concepts of geriatrics frailty, dementia and palliative care are also
discussed, as nephrologists frequently participate in decision-making directed
toward balancing longevity, functional status and the burden of therapy.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the acute and late outcomes
of a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) program including both the
transfemoral (TF) and transapical (TA) approaches; and 2) to determine the
results of TAVI in patients deemed inoperable because of either porcelain aorta
or frailty.
BACKGROUND: Very few data exist on the results of a comprehensive TAVI program
including both TA and TF approaches for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis
in patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with the Edwards valve (Edwards 
Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, California) between January 2005 and June 2009 in 6
Canadian centers were included.
RESULTS: A total of 345 procedures (TF: 168, TA: 177) were performed in 339
patients. The predicted surgical mortality (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk
score) was 9.8 +/- 6.4%. The procedural success rate was 93.3%, and 30-day
mortality was 10.4% (TF: 9.5%, TA: 11.3%). After a median follow-up of 8 months
(25th to 75th interquartile range: 3 to 14 months) the mortality rate was 22.1%. 
The predictors of cumulative late mortality were peri-procedural sepsis (hazard
ratio [HR]: 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48 to 8.28) or need for
hemodynamic support (HR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.11 to 6), pulmonary hypertension (PH)
(HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR: 2.30, 95% CI:
1.38 to 3.84), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 1.75, 95%
CI: 1.09 to 2.83). Patients with either porcelain aorta (18%) or frailty (25%)
exhibited acute outcomes similar to the rest of the study population, and
porcelain aorta patients tended to have a better survival rate at 1-year
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: A TAVI program including both TF and TA approaches was associated
with comparable mortality as predicted by surgical risk calculators for the
treatment of patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk, including
porcelain aorta and frail patients. Baseline (PH, COPD, CKD) and peri-procedural 
(hemodynamic support, sepsis) factors but not the approach determined worse
outcomes.

Specific laboratory tests and physical findings are available to the practicing
clinician that should raise the suspicion of inflammation. Inflammation is
related to specific clinical outcomes. Once identified, changes in clinical
practice may affect the level of inflammation in individual and or groups of
dialysis patients with the hope that these changes may in turn affect outcome in 
a positive manner. Standard clinical tests and observations associated with
inflammation are hypoalbuminemia, erythropoietin resistance, decreased iron
saturation accompanied by high ferritin, frailty, low serum creatinine, reduced
total and LDL-cholesterol, and increased C reactive protein (CRP). Inflammation
is strongly associated with loss of physical function, dyslipidemia (low LDL- and
HDL-cholesterol, increased triglycerides), and anemia that is unresponsive to
erythropoietin. Inflammation is associated with cardiovascular events, increased 
hospitalization, and death. Correctible causes of inflammation are tunneled
dialysis catheters, arteriovenous grafts, catheter infection, periodontal
disease, poor water quality, and dialyzer incompatibility. Obesity also is a
source of cytokines but may be less amenable to treatment. Inflammation is
multifactorial in dialysis patients. Some sources are recognizable and
correctable, such as vascular access type, clinical infection, and water quality,
and some are not. Inflammation is strongly associated with outcome.

Health-related quality of life outcomes in chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

Older adults (aged >or=65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD
population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging.
Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the
frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among
vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical 
performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death.
Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits 
seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a
highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the
trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed 
to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to
identify opportunities to intervene.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney
disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated
criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to 
determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were
associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the
association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly
increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for
the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds 
of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation,
vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and
chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney
disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.
Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection
remain elusive.

The majority of colorectal cancer patients receive chemotherapy either to
palliate advanced unresectable disease or to reduce the risk of recurrence after 
radical surgery. Thanks to the improvements in systemic chemotherapy, in the last
20 years the median survival time for patients with unresectable metastatic
disease has indeed progressively increased from less than 6 to almost 24 months
and recurrences after radical surgery in patients with early-stage tumors have
been halved. Although colorectal cancer incidence increase with aging, there is
limited scientific evidence based on prospective clinical trials to guide the
management of elderly colorectal cancer patients. In addition, aging is a
continuum process making strict cut-off difficult to define and homogeneous
subgroups hard to identify. There is significant heterogeneity also as regards
comorbidities, overall physical ability, mental health and functional status.
Specific guidelines for the medical treatment of elderly colorectal cancer
patients are therefore difficult to draw. While fit patients are generally
treated with adult protocols and frail individuals rarely receive chemotherapy,
managing the intermediate vulnerable patients requires a careful balance between 
the biological and psycho-social costs of treatment, the aggressiveness of the
tumor and its perception by the patient. In this review, the major achievements
of chemotherapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer will be described and the
available data addressing the extension of these chemotherapy programs to elderly
patients will be discussed. Special emphasis will be given to the development of 
specific treatment strategies depending on the degree of disease aggressiveness. 
Empirical suggestions to adapt the chemotherapy programs developed for adult fit 
patients to subjects with various degrees of vulnerability and frailty will also 
be given along with practical indications for the use of specific
chemotherapeutic agents in the presence of some common elderly-related
comorbidities.

In many longitudinal clinical studies, the level and progression rate of
repeatedly measured biomarkers on each subject quantify the severity of the
disease and that subject's susceptibility to progression of the disease. It is of
scientific and clinical interest to relate such quantities to a later
time-to-event clinical endpoint such as patient survival. This is usually done
with a shared parameter model. In such models, the longitudinal biomarker data
and the survival outcome of each subject are assumed to be conditionally
independent given subject-level severity or susceptibility (also called frailty
in statistical terms). In this article, we study the case where the conditional
distribution of longitudinal data is modeled by a linear mixed-effect model, and 
the conditional distribution of the survival data is given by a Cox proportional 
hazard model. We allow unknown regression coefficients and time-dependent
covariates in both models. The proposed estimators are maximizers of an exact
correction to the joint log likelihood with the frailties eliminated as nuisance 
parameters, an idea that originated from correction of covariate measurement
error in measurement error models. The corrected joint log likelihood is shown to
be asymptotically concave and leads to consistent and asymptotically normal
estimators. Unlike most published methods for joint modeling, the proposed
estimation procedure does not rely on distributional assumptions of the
frailties. The proposed method was studied in simulations and applied to a data
set from the Hemodialysis Study.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is an emergent health-related problem in older adults. The aim
of this study was to examine the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and the
effect of frailty in elderly patients with cardiometabolic risk factors.
METHODS: One-hundred and one patients 65 years or older responded to an HRQOL
assessment using the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-26
questionnaire. Frailty was assessed using two indices: the Hebrew Rehabilitation 
Center for Aged (HRCA) vulnerability index and the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES)
index. In addition, these patients completed self-rating questionnaires assessing
mental well-being [the 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire
(GHQ-28)] and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale).
RESULTS: Based on the combination of HRCA and VES indices, 24 subjects (23.7%)
met the criteria of frail. Persons > or = 75 years old and those with depressive 
mood or lower creatinine clearance had significantly lower WHOQOL-26 scores than 
their counterparts. Diabetes and macrovascular complications did not associate
with the WHOQOL-26 scores. Compared with non-frail patients, the frail scored
lower on the WHOQOL-26 questionnaire after adjusting for age, kidney dysfunction 
and depressive mood. Frail patients also reported significantly higher the GHQ-28
scores compared with non-frail patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail older adults had a significant lower HRQOL, as well as lower
mental well-being, independent of age, diabetes, macrovascular complication,
kidney dysfunction and depressed mood.

Highly active antiretroviral treatment has resulted in dramatically increased
life expectancy among patients with HIV infection who are now aging while
receiving treatment and are at risk of developing chronic diseases associated
with advanced age. Similarities between aging and the courses of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
suggest that HIV infection compresses the aging process, perhaps accelerating
comorbidities and frailty. In a workshop organized by the Association of
Specialty Professors, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the HIV Medical
Association, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute on
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, researchers in infectious diseases, geriatrics, 
immunology, and gerontology met to review what is known about HIV infection and
aging, to identify research gaps, and to suggest high priority topics for future 
research. Answers to the questions posed are likely to help prioritize and
balance strategies to slow the progression of HIV infection, to address
comorbidities and drug toxicity, and to enhance understanding about both HIV
infection and aging.

Dedicated European and US clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes in the elderly 
have been released, but they do not specifically address the issue of advanced
chronic kidney disease (CKD) in older patients with diabetes. General clinical
guidelines have been published on the treatment of patients with diabetic
nephropathy (DN), but these address the issue of how to prevent progression and
treat advanced DN without distinguishing between different age groups. Elderly
patients with diabetes and stages 3 to 4 CKD have particular needs that differ
from those of younger patients with the same conditions. This is mainly due to
their frailty and shorter life expectancy. Differently tailored therapeutic
strategies are needed, which may have less stringent targets; and the use of
common drugs should be critically evaluated. The management agenda (metabolic
control, low-protein diet, controlling BP, preventing progression of advanced DN,
preventing cardiovascular outcomes) for these patients is discussed in light of
the limits and perspectives of current guidelines. Intensive, simultaneous
management of all items on the agenda may not be feasible for a proportion of
older patients, and clinicians may have to give priority to reducing some risk
factors rather than others, choosing between different therapies.

New advances in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) change the
perspective from which many of its features and treatment are viewed. Calcium,
phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D have been shown to be
important determinants of survival associated with kidney diseases. Now ROD
dependent and independent of these factors is linked to survival more than just
skeletal frailty. This review focuses on recent discoveries that renal injury
impairs skeletal anabolism decreasing the osteoblast compartment of the skeleton 
and consequent bone formation. This discovery and the discovery that PTH
regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche alters our view of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) from that of a disease to
that of a necessary adaptation to renal injury that goes awry. Furthermore, ROD
is shown to be an underappreciated factor in the level of the serum phosphorus in
CKD. The discovery and the elucidation of the mechanism of hyperphosphatemia as a
cardiovascular risk in CKD change the view of ROD. It is now recognized as more
than a skeletal disorder, it is an important component of the mortality of CKD
that can be treated.

Acute coronary care in the elderly, part I: Non-ST-segment-elevation acute
coronary syndromes: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the 
American Heart Association Council on Clinical Cardiology: in collaboration with 
the Society of Geriatric Cardiology.

BACKGROUND: Age is an important determinant of outcomes for patients with acute
coronary syndromes (ACS); however, community practice reveals a
disproportionately lower use of cardiovascular medications and invasive treatment
even among elderly patients with ACS who would stand to benefit. Reasons include 
limited trial data to guide the care of older adults and uncertainty about
benefits and risks, particularly with newer medications or invasive treatments
and in the setting of advanced age or complex health status.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This 2-part American Heart Association scientific statement 
summarizes evidence on patient heterogeneity, clinical presentation, and
treatment of non-ST-elevation ACS in relation to age (< 65, 65 to 74, 75 to 84,
and > or = 85 years). In addition, we review methodological issues that influence
the acquisition and application of evidence to the elderly patients treated in
community practice. A writing group combining international cardiovascular and
geriatric perspectives convened to summarize available data from trials (5
combined Virtual Coordinating Center for Global Collaborative Cardiovascular
Research [VIGOUR] trials) and 3 registries (Global Registry of Acute Coronary
Events, National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, and the Can Rapid risk
stratification of Unstable angina patients Suppress ADverse outcomes with Early
implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
guidelines national quality improvement initiative [CRUSADE]) to provide a
conceptual framework for future work in the care of the elderly with acute
cardiac disease. Treatment for non-ST-segment-elevation ACS (Part I) and
ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (Part II) are reviewed. In addition,
ethical considerations pertaining to acute care and secondary prevention are
considered (Part II). The primary goal is to identify the areas in which
sufficient evidence is available to guide practice, as well as to determine areas
that warrant further study. Although treatment-related benefits should rise in an
elderly population with high disease risk, data to assess these benefits are
limited, outcomes of importance vary, and heterogeneity among the elderly
increases treatment-related risks. Although a uniform approach to care in the
oldest of the old is unlikely, understanding the major contributors to benefits
and risks from treatment will advance the ability to apply guideline-based care
in this subset of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a few recent trials have described treatment effects in
older patients, others continue to exclude patients on the basis of age. Going
forward, prospective trials should enroll elderly subjects proportionate to their
prevalence among the treated population to define risk and benefit. Findings from
age subgroup analyses should be reported in a consistent manner across trials,
including absolute and relative risks for efficacy and safety. Outcomes of
particular relevance to the elderly, such as quality of life, physical function, 
and independence, should also be considered. Creatinine clearance should be
calculated for every elderly patient to enable appropriate dosing. In addition,
physicians need an understanding of conditions unique to older patients (eg,
frailty, cognitive impairment) that influence treatment goals and outcomes. With 
these efforts, treatment risks can be minimized, and benefits can be placed in
the health context of the elderly patient with ACS.

In clinical and observational studies, recurrent event data (e.g.,
hospitalization) with a terminal event (e.g., death) are often encountered. In
many instances, the terminal event is strongly correlated with the recurrent
event process. In this article, we propose a semiparametric method to jointly
model the recurrent and terminal event processes. The dependence is modeled by a 
shared gamma frailty that is included in both the recurrent event rate and
terminal event hazard function. Marginal models are used to estimate the
regression effects on the terminal and recurrent event processes, and a Poisson
model is used to estimate the dispersion of the frailty variable. A sandwich
estimator is used to achieve additional robustness. An analysis of
hospitalization data for patients in the peritoneal dialysis study is presented
to illustrate the proposed method.

This study investigated mortality in 568 individuals from the Goessel Mennonite
community in rural central Kansas. There were three main objectives to this
research: 1) characterize mortality trends within a biologically well-defined
Mennonite community; 2) determine what biochemical, morphological, and
physiological risk factors could be related to all-cause mortality, stratified by
age and sex; and 3) compare these results to previously described variables that 
were associated with both biological age and mortality in this population.
Mortality data were obtained from three sources: Kansas Vital Records, the Social
Security death index, and church records. In total, 221 (39%) individuals were
found to have died in this population between January 1980-June 2002. Analogous
to the larger US population, the three leading causes of death in this community 
were heart disease, cancer, and stroke, accounting for 60% of all deaths. Besides
advancing age, the greatest biological risk factor in this population was
decreased amounts of albumin in men (relative risk, 2.47), potentially indicating
underreported cases of either chronic kidney disease or frailty syndrome for
males. Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated that increased amounts of
total cholesterol may provide a protective effect for elderly individuals. We
conclude, based on the previously described heritability of both albumin (h(2) = 
0.40) and total cholesterol (h(2) = 0.50) in this population, that underlying
genetic factors associated with both chronic degenerative diseases and biological
aging may have important implications for understanding mortality patterns in
this community.

BACKGROUND: Physiologic changes and disease-related alterations in organ function
occur with aging. These changes can affect drug pharmacokinetics in older
persons.
OBJECTIVE: This article reviews age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and their
clinical relevance.
METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted using the terms elderly and
pharmacokinetics. Other reviews were also included for literature searching. The 
review includes literature in particular from 1990 through April 2004. Some
articles from before 1990 were included to help illustrate principles of
age-related pharmacokinetics.
RESULTS: There are minor changes in drug absorption with aging. The effect of
aging on small-bowel transporter systems is not yet fully established.
Bioavailability of highly extracted drugs often is increased with age.
Transdermal absorption may be delayed, especially in the case of water-soluble
compounds. Fat-soluble drugs may distribute more widely and water-soluble drugs
less extensively in older persons. Hepatic drug metabolism shows wide
interindividual variation, and in many cases, there is an age-related decline in 
elimination of metabolized drugs, particularly those eliminated by the cytochrome
enzyme system. Any decrement in cytochrome enzyme metabolism appears
nonselective. Synthetic conjugation metabolism is less affected by age.
Pseudocapillarization of the sinusoidal endothelium in the liver, restricting
oxygen diffusion, and the decline in liver size and liver blood flow may
influence age-related changes in rate of hepatic metabolism. Frailty,
physiological stress, and illness are important predictors of drug metabolism in 
older individuals. Inhibition of drug metabolism is not altered with aging, but
induction is reduced in a minority of studies. Renal drug elimination typically
declines with age, commensurate with the fall in creatinine clearance. Renal
tubular organic acid transport may decline with age, while the function of the
organic base transporter is preserved but may be less responsive to stimulation.
CONCLUSION: Changes in pharmacokinetics occur due to age-related physiologic
perturbations. These changes contribute to altered dose requirements in older
persons, particularly in the case of drugs eliminated by the kidney.
Interindividual variation, disease, frailty, and stress may overshadow
age-related changes.

The purpose of this study was to identify demographic, disease, health care, and 
psychosocial-spiritual factors associated with death distress (death-related
depression and anxiety). Cross-sectional baseline data from a randomized
controlled trial were used. Outpatients (n=70) were recruited from an urban
academic medical centre and proprietary hospital. All patients had
life-threatening medical conditions, including cancer; pulmonary, cardiac, liver,
or kidney disease; HIV/AIDS; or geriatric frailty. Measures of death distress,
physical symptom severity, depression and anxiety symptoms, spiritual well-being,
social support, patient-perceived physician communication, and patient-perceived 
quality of health care experiences were administered. In a hierarchical multiple 
regression model, higher death distress was significantly associated with living 
alone, greater physical symptom severity, more severe depression symptoms, lower 
spiritual well-being, and less physician communication as perceived by the
patient. Death distress as a unique experiential construct was discriminable
among younger patients with specific, diagnosable life-threatening conditions,
but less so among geriatric frailty patients. The findings suggest that the
experience of death distress among patients with life-threatening medical
conditions is associated with the psychosocial-spiritual dimensions of the
patient's life. Attention to these dimensions may buffer the negative affects of 
death distress.

In this paper, we describe Bayesian modeling of dependent multivariate survival
data using positive stable frailty distributions. A flexible baseline hazard
formulation using a piecewise exponential model with a correlated prior process
is used. The estimation of the stable law parameter together with the parameters 
of the (conditional) proportional hazards model is facilitated by a modified
Gibbs sampling procedure. The methodology is illustrated on kidney infection data
(McGilchrist and Aisbett, 1991).

The accelerated failure time (AFT) model is an important alternative to the Cox
proportional hazards model (PHM) in survival analysis. For multivariate failure
time data we propose to use frailties to explicitly account for possible
correlations (and heterogeneity) among failure times. An EM-like algorithm
analogous to that in the frailty model for the Cox model is adapted. Through
simulation it is shown that its performance compares favorably with that of the
marginal independence approach. For illustration we reanalyze a real data set.

BACKGROUND: Alport syndrome (AS) is a severe hereditary disease usually
transmitted as an X dominant trait and involving a mutation of the COL4A5 gene.
It leads to end-stage renal failure (ESRF), but this progression is
heterogeneous. Mutations of the COL4A5 gene have been characterised in numerous
families using molecular biology. Our objective was to evaluate the interfamilial
heterogeneity of the disease and to study relationships between mutation types
and progression to ESRF in the European Community Alport Syndrome Concerted
Action group (ECASCA) registry database.
METHODS: We used the frailty model framework. Frailty models have been developed 
to analyse censored data with non-independent observations. Random effects are
introduced in a Cox proportional regression model to take into account the
intracluster correlations. In this study, ESRF is considered a censored event and
the intrafamilial correlations are taken into account in the frailty models.
RESULTS: These approaches allow us to demonstrate the existence of an
interfamilial heterogeneity; the role of the mutation type explains the
interfamilial variability. In particular, the results suggest that some mutation 
types are associated with a higher risk of ESRF for males.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of characterising the mutation at
the molecular level in genetic studies, to understand the relationship between
genotype and phenotype. The frailty models constitute an attractive approach in
this context, when the phenotype is characterised by a censored end-point.

BACKGROUND: Statistical analysis for correlated censored data allows to study
censored events in clustered structure designs. Considering a possible
correlation among failure times of the same group, standard methodology is no
longer applicable. We investigated proposed models in this context to study
familial data about a genetic disease, Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome is a
severe hereditary disease due to abnormal collagenous chains. Renal failure is
the main symptom of the disease. It progresses toward end-stage renal failure
(IRT) according to a high time variability. As shown by genetic studies,
mutations of COL4A5 gene are involved in the X-linked Alport Syndrome. Due to the
large range of the mutation types, the aim of this study was to search for a
possible genetic origin of the heterogeneity of the disease severity.
METHODS: Marginal survival models and mixed effects survival models (so-called
frailty models) were proposed to take into account the possible non independence 
of the observations. In this study, time until end-stage renal failure is a
rightly censored end point. Possible intra-familial correlations due to shared
environmental and/or genetic factors could induce dependence among familial
failure times. In this paper, we fit marginal and frailty proportional hazards
models to evaluate the effect of mutation type on the risk of IRT and an
interfamilial heterogeneity of failure times.
RESULTS: In this study, the use of these models allows to show the presence of an
interfamilial heterogeneity of the failure times to IRT. Moreover, the results
suggest that some mutation types are linked to a higher risk of fast evolution to
IRT, which explains partially the interfamilial heterogeneity of the failure
times.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows the interest of marginal and frailty models to
evaluate the heterogeneity of censored responses and to study relationships
between a censored criterion and covariables. This study puts forward the
importance of characterizing the mutation at a molecular level to understand the 
relationship between genotype and phenotype.

A Weibull regression model with gamma frailties for multivariate survival data.

Frequently in the analysis of survival data, survival times within the same group
are correlated due to unobserved co-variates. One way these co-variates can be
included in the model is as frailties. These frailty random block effects
generate dependency between the survival times of the individuals which are
conditionally independent given the frailty. Using a conditional proportional
hazards model, in conjunction with the frailty, a whole new family of models is
introduced. By considering a gamma frailty model, often the issue is to find an
appropriate model for the baseline hazard function. In this paper a flexible
baseline hazard model based on a correlated prior process is proposed and is
compared with a standard Weibull model. Several model diagnostics methods are
developed and model comparison is made using recently developed Bayesian model
selection criteria. The above methodologies are applied to the McGilchrist and
Aisbett (1991) kidney infection data and the analysis is performed using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo methods.

Survival differences among older dialysis patients in the southeast.

GA.

Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic dialysis have
higher mortality in the United States than in many other countries. While
increasing age, white race, male sex, and/or diabetes are considered risk factors
for survival, few studies of older dialysis patients have simultaneously
considered multiple predictor variables and their interactions. Using information
contained in the 1982 to 1986 ESRD Network 20 database for Georgia and South
Carolina, we studied hospitalizations and survival of 1,354 blacks and 965 whites
who were age 60 years or older when they began dialysis therapy. Survival time
was modeled using the Cox life-table regression method. Older blacks' median age 
at dialysis initiation was 67.4, compared with 68.7 for older whites (P = 0.001).
Blacks were more likely than whites (P < 0.001) to have hypertension-related or
diabetes-related ESRD. White patients experienced approximately 25% more
hospitalization when adjustment was made for patient-days at risk. Separate
multivariate survival models were required for patients with diabetes-related
versus non-diabetes-related ESRD. Among diabetics, mortality was higher among
whites and among patients who were older when they began dialysis. Among patients
with non-diabetes-related ESRD, mortality was higher among patients who were
older when they began dialysis, but the age effect was much stronger for white
males. Our hospitalization and mortality data support the view that unmeasured
severity (or frailty) differences characterize white as compared with black
dialysis patients. Among non-diabetes-related ESRD patients, the age effect on
survival was more severe in white males than in blacks or in white females. The
high mortality we observed among older dialysis patients in Georgia and South
Carolina warrants further study; the data may in part reflect patients' lower
socioeconomic status compared with age, race, and sex-matched controls.
