BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Withdrawal from maintenance hemodialysis before death 
has become more common because of high disease and treatment burden. The study
objective was to identify patient factors and examine the terminal course
associated with hemodialysis withdrawal, and assess patterns of palliative care
involvement before death among patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We designed an observational
cohort study of adult patients on incident hemodialysis in a midwestern United
States tertiary center, from January 2001 to November 2013, with death events
through to November 2015. Logistic regression models evaluated associations
between patient characteristics and withdrawal status and palliative care service
utilization.
RESULTS: Among 1226 patients, 536 died and 262 (49% of 536) withdrew. A random
sample (10%; 52 out of 536) review of Death Notification Forms revealed 73%
sensitivity for withdrawal. Risk factors for withdrawal before death included
older age, white race, palliative care consultation within 6 months,
hospitalization within 30 days, cerebrovascular disease, and no coronary artery
disease. Most withdrawal decisions were made by patients (60%) or a family member
(33%; surrogates). The majority withdrew either because of acute medical
complications (51%) or failure to thrive/frailty (22%). After withdrawal, median 
time to death was 7 days (interquartile range, 4-11). In-hospital deaths were
less common in the withdrawal group (34% versus 46% nonwithdrawal, P=0.003). A
third (34%; 90 out of 262) of those that withdrew received palliative care
services. Palliative care consultation in the withdrawal group was associated
with longer hemodialysis duration (odds ratio, 1.19 per year; 95% confidence
interval, 1.10 to 1.3; P<0.001), hospitalization within 30 days of death (odds
ratio, 5.78; 95% confidence interval, 2.62 to 12.73; P<0.001), and death in
hospital (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 3.27; P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study, the rate of hemodialysis withdrawals
were twice the frequency previously described. Acute medical complications and
frailty appeared to be driving factors. However, palliative care services were
used in only a minority of patients.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation offers improved survival and quality of life
to an increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease.
However, elderly kidney transplant recipients may face unique challenges due to a
higher burden of comorbidity, greater cumulative risk of
immunosuppression-related complications and increasing frailty. We aimed to
describe the perspectives of elderly kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to April 2015. Qualitative studies
were eligible if they reported views from elderly kidney transplant recipients
(≥60 years). Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the findings.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving >116 recipients were included. We
identified seven themes. 'Regaining strength and vitality' meant valuing the
physical and psychosocial improvements in daily functioning and life
participation. 'Extending life' was the willingness to accept any organ,
including extended criteria kidneys, to prolong survival. 'Debt of gratitude'
entailed conscious appreciation toward their donor while knowing they were unable
to repay their sacrifice. 'Moral responsibility to maintain health' motivated
adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations out of an ethical duty to
protect their gift for graft survival. 'Unabating and worsening forgetfulness'
hindered self-management. 'Disillusionment with side effects and complications'
reflected disappointment and exasperation with the unintended consequences of
medications. 'Finality of treatment option' was an acute awareness that the
current transplant may be their last.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation was perceived to slow and even reverse the
experience of aging among elderly recipients, especially compared with dialysis. 
However, some were frustrated over persistent limitations after transplant,
struggled with the burden of medication side effects and worried about a possible
return to dialysis if the transplant failed. Clarifying patient expectations of
transplantation, providing support to alleviate the debilitating impacts of
immunosuppression and addressing fears about deteriorating health and graft
failure may improve satisfaction and outcomes in elderly kidney transplant
recipients.

Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults in Primary and Secondary Care.

The Renal National Service Framework (NSF), and the subsequent NICE Clinical
Practice Guideline for early identification and management of adults with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) in primary and secondary care (CG73), served to emphasise
the change in focus in renal medicine from treatment of established kidney
disease to earlier identification and prevention of kidney disease. CKD describes
abnormal kidney function and/or structure. It is common, frequently unrecognised 
and often coexists with other conditions (for example, cardiovascular disease and
diabetes). Moderate to severe CKD also carries an increased risk of other
significant adverse outcomes such acute kidney injury, falls, frailty and
mortality. The risk of developing CKD increases with increasing age, and some
conditions that coexist with CKD become more severe and increasingly prevalent as
kidney dysfunction advances. CKD can progress to end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD)in a small but significant percentage of people. CKD is usually
asymptomatic but it is detectable, and tests for detecting CKD are both simple
and freely available. There is evidence that treatment can prevent or delay the
progression of CKD, reduce or prevent the development of complications and reduce
the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, because of a lack of specific
symptoms, CKD frequently remains undetected and unrecognised. As a consequence
people with CKD are often not diagnosed, or diagnosed late when CKD is at an
advanced stage. Late diagnosis is associated with increased morbidity, mortality 
and healthcare associated costs.

Older people constitute an increasingly greater proportion of patients with
advanced CKD, including those patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment.
Frailty is a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors
that results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and
causes vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty is common in elderly CKD
patients, and it may be associated with protein-energy wasting (PEW), sarcopenia,
dynapenia, and other complications of CKD. Causes of frailty with or without PEW 
in the elderly with CKD can be classified into three categories: causes primarily
caused by aging per se, advanced CKD per se, or a combination of both conditions.
Frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients are associated with impaired physical
performance, disability, poorer quality of life, and reduced survival. Prevention
and treatment of these conditions in the elderly CKD patients often require a
multifaceted approach. Here, we examine the causes and consequences of these
conditions and examine the interplay between frailty and PEW in elderly CKD
patients.
