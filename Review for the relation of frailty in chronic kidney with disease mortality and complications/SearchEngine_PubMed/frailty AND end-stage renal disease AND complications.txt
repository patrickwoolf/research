Motor functions are deteriorated by aging. Some conditions may magnify this
deterioration. This study examined whether hemodialysis (HD) process would
negatively impact gait and balance beyond diabetes condition among mid-age adults
(48⁻64 years) and older adults (65+ years). One hundred and ninety-six subjects
(age = 66.2 ± 9.1 years, body-mass-index = 30.1 ± 6.4 kg/m², female = 56%) in 5
groups were recruited: mid-age adults with diabetes undergoing HD (Mid-age HD+, n
= 38) and without HD (Mid-age HD-, n = 40); older adults with diabetes undergoing
HD (Older HD+, n = 36) and without HD (Older HD-, n = 37); and non-diabetic older
adults (Older DM-, n = 45). Gait parameters (stride velocity, stride length, gait
cycle time, and double support) and balance parameters (ankle, hip, and center of
mass sways) were quantified using validated wearable platforms. Groups with
diabetes had overall poorer gait and balance compared to the non-diabetic group
(p < 0.050). Among people with diabetes, HD+ had significantly worsened gait and 
balance when comparing to HD- (Cohen's effect size d = 0.63⁻2.32, p < 0.050).
Between-group difference was more pronounced among older adults with the largest 
effect size observed for stride length (d = 2.32, p < 0.001). Results suggested
that deterioration in normalized gait speed among HD+ was negatively correlated
with age (r = -0.404, p < 0.001), while this correlation was diminished among
HD-. Interestingly, results also suggested that poor gait among Older HD- is
related to poor ankle stability, while no correlation was observed between poor
ankle stability and poor gait among Older HD+. Using objective assessments,
results confirmed that the presence of diabetes can deteriorate gait and balance,
and this deterioration can be magnified by HD process. Among HD- people with
diabetes, poor ankle stability described poor gait. However, among people with
diabetes undergoing HD, age was a dominate factor describing poor gait
irrespective of static balance. Results also suggested feasibility of using
wearable platforms to quantify motor performance during routine dialysis clinic
visit. These objective assessments may assist in identifying early deterioration 
in motor function, which in turn may promote timely intervention.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 2% to 4% of patients with
severe aortic stenosis. It is because these patients have been excluded from
clinical trials, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in 
this patient group has not been thoroughly investigated. Between April 2008 and
March 2015, 2,000 patients (dialysis group, n = 56 [2.8%]) were consecutively
enrolled when diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and eligible to undergo TAVI.
Procedural and longer-term outcomes were analyzed and adjusted for differences in
baseline characteristics. Patients on dialysis had a higher periprocedural
mortality (10.7% vs 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 5.65, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.91 to 16.67; p = 0.002) and a lower Valve Academic Research
Consortium (VARC)-II (VARC) defined device success (adjOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to
0.79; p = 0.012). At 30 days, there was an increased rate of all-cause mortality 
(21.4 vs 4.8%; adjOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.96 to 12.26; p = 0.001), cardiovascular
(adjOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.41; p = 0.007) and noncardiovascular mortality
(adjOR 6.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 9.41; p = 0.019), myocardial infarction (adjOR 9.39, 
95% CI 1.84 to 48.03; p = 0.007), bleeding (adjOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.83;
p = 0.036) as well as the VARC-II defined early safety combined end point (adjOR 
2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.90; p = 0.012) associated with dialysis. Dialysis was
associated with poor survival at one (57.1% vs 84.2%) and 3 years (26.8% vs
66.9%) with or without the consideration of the first 72 hours (p <0.001;
adjusted p <0.001). Although, in the multivariable regression analysis, reduced
ejection fraction, peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH),
frailty and dialysis were associated with 1-year mortality, only PH (>60 mm Hg)
remained significant in an analysis restricted to the dialysis patients (adjusted
hazard ratio 2.68; 95% CI 1.18 to 5.88; p = 0.018). PH had a sensitivity of
45.8%, a specificity of 81.3%, and a positive predictive value of 64.7%. In
conclusion, dialysis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who
underwent TAVI. Long-term mortality in dialysis patients appears to be largely
determined by the kidney disease and/or dialysis itself whereas VARC-II defined
complications are largely unaffected. An increased short-term mortality still
calls for (pre-) procedural optimization.

The number of elderly people has increased considerably over the last decades,
due to a rising life expectancy and ageing populations. As a result, an increased
number of elderly with end-stage-renal-disease are diagnosed, for which the
preferred treatment is renal transplantation. Over the past years the awareness
of the elderly as a specific patient population has grown, which increases the
importance of research in this group. Elderly patients often receive kidneys from
elderly donors while younger donor kidneys are preferentially reserved for
younger recipients. Although the rate of acute rejection after transplantation is
lower in the elderly, these rejections may lead to graft loss more frequently, as
kidneys from elderly donors have marginal reserve capacity. To prevent acute
rejection, immunosuppressive therapy is needed. On the other hand, elderly
patients have a higher risk to die from infectious complications, and thus less
immunosuppression would be preferable. Immunosuppressive treatment in the elderly
is complicated further by changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
with increasing age. Adjustments in standard immunosuppressive regimes are
therefore suggested for this population. An unmet need in transplantation
medicine is a tool to guide a personalized approach to immunosuppression.
Recently several promising biomarkers that identify injury to the graft at an
early stage or predict acute rejection have been identified. Unfortunately, none 
of these biomarkers were tested specifically in the elderly. We believe there is 
an urgent need to perform clinical trials investigating novel immunosuppressive
regimens in conjunction with biomarker studies in this specific population.

Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

BACKGROUND: Patient-centered quality outcomes such as disposition after surgery
are increasingly being scrutinized. Preoperative factors predictive of nonhome
discharge (DC) may identify at-risk patients for targeted interventions. This
study examines the association among preoperative risk factors, frailty, and
nonhome DC after elective vascular surgery procedures in patients living at home.
METHODS: The 2011-2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was
queried to identify all home-dwelling patients who underwent elective vascular
procedures (endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair, suprainguinal and
infrainguinal bypasses, peripheral endovascular interventions, carotid
endarterectomy, and stent). Preoperative frailty was measured using the modified 
frailty index (mFI; derived from Canadian Study of Health and Aging). Univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the
association of frailty and nonhome DC.
RESULTS: Of 15,843 home-dwelling patients, 1,177 patients (7.4%) did not return
home postoperatively. Frailty (mFI > 0.25) conferred a significantly increased
2-fold risk of nonhome DC disposition for each procedure type. Frailty, female
gender, open procedures, increasing age, end-stage renal disease, and occurrence 
of any postoperative complication were associated with increased risk of nonhome 
DC. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, frailty increased the odds of
nonhome DC by 60% (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4-1.8) after
adjusting for other covariates. In the presence of complications, the risk of
nonhome DC was 27.5% in frail versus 16.5% in nonfrail patients (P < 0.001). In
the absence of complications, although absolute risk was lower, frail patients
were nearly twice as likely to not return home (frail 5.5% vs. nonfrail 2.75%,
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail home-dwelling patients undergoing elective vascular procedures
are at high risk of not returning home after surgery. Preoperative frailty
assessment appears to hold potential for counseling regarding postsurgery
disposition and DC planning.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With aging of the general population, patients who
enter dialysis therapy will more frequently have geriatric impairments and a
considerable comorbidity burden. The most vulnerable among these patients might
benefit from conservative therapy. Whether assessment of geriatric impairments
would contribute to the decision-making process of dialysis initiation is
unknown.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A systematic Medline and Embase
search was performed on December 1, 2015 to identify studies assessing the
association between risk of mortality or hospitalization and one or more
geriatric impairments at the start of dialysis therapy, including impairment of
cognitive function, mood, performance status or (instrumental) activities of
daily living, mobility (including falls), social environment, or nutritional
status.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were identified that assessed one or more geriatric
impairments with respect to prognosis. The quality of most studies was moderate. 
Only seven studies carried out an analysis of elderly patients (≥70 years old).
Malnutrition and frailty were systematically assessed, and their relation with
mortality was clear. In addition, cognitive impairment and functional outcomes at
the initiation of dialysis were related to an increased mortality in most
studies. However, not all studies applied systematic assessment tools, thereby
potentially missing relevant impairment. None of the studies applied a geriatric 
assessment across multiple domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric impairment across multiple domains at dialysis initiation 
is related to poor outcome. However, information in the elderly is sparse, and a 
systematic approach of multiple domains with respect to poor outcome has not been
performed. Because a geriatric assessment has proved useful in predicting outcome
in other medical fields, its potential role in the ESRD population should be the 
subject of future research.

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with
destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial
cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However,
surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis
rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on
hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal
kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree
decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior
instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to
adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical 
motion.

Background. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a high symptom
burden, among which fatigue is highly prevalent. Many fatigue-assessing
instruments exist, but comparisons among instruments in this patient population
have yet to be investigated. Methods. ESRD patients under chronic hemodialysis
were prospectively enrolled and seven types of fatigue instruments were
administered: Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Lee Fatigue
Scale (LFS), Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and
Short-Form 36-Vitality (SF36-V). Using these instruments, we investigated the
correlation between fatigue severity and clinical/biochemical parameters,
including demographic/comorbidity profile, dialysis-related complications, and
frailty severity. We used regression analysis with serum albumin and frailty
severity as the dependent variables to investigate the independent correlations. 
Results. A total of 46 ESRD patients were enrolled (average age of 67 ± 11.6
years), and 50% of them had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results from the seven
tested instruments showed high correlation with each other. We found that the
fatigue severity by FACIT-F was significantly associated with age (p = 0.03),
serum albumin (p = 0.003) and creatinine (p = 0.02) levels, while SF36-V scores
were also significantly associated with age (p = 0.02) and serum creatinine
levels (p = 0.04). However, the fatigue severity measured by the FSS, FSI, FQ,
BFI, and LFS did not exhibit these associations. Moreover, regression analysis
showed that only FACIT-F scores were independently associated with serum albumin 
levels and frailty severity in ESRD patients. Conclusion. Among the seven
fatigue-assessing instruments, only the FACIT-F yielded results that demonstrated
significant and independent associations with important outcome-related features 
in ESRD patients.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

Body composition in chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

AIM: Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on its impact
on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different
self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these patients has not been
attempted before.
METHODS: A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural centre was
recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered
to these patients. Clinical and dialysis-related laboratory parameters were
collected. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis
complications were performed, and variables demonstrating significant
correlations were entered into multivariate regression models to determine their 
independent associations.
RESULTS: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail
Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and
Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic
dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire showed significant association with each
other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated
significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher Liu's
comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and creatinine
levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The other five
questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important
dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis
identified an independently negative association between serum albumin and the
simple FRAIL scale results (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study establishing the utility of different
self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients.
The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a closer relationship with
dialysis-related complications.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Testosterone among Patients with End-Stage Renal
Disease.

Bao Y(1), Johansen KL.

The prevalence of low testosterone level is particularly high among patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been associated with mortality. In
populations without ESRD, low testosterone level has also been associated with a 
number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low
muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty. However, there
is controversy regarding what constitutes low testosterone level in the aging
population and at what level replacement therapy with testosterone is indicated. 
There are no randomized controlled trials investigating long-term outcomes of
testosterone replacement therapy in populations with or without ESRD. Available
trial results suggest equivocal improvements in sexual function. Muscle mass and 
bone mineral density appear to improve, but results in physical function and
performance are mixed and there are no data on fracture prevention. Some recent
data suggest harm when testosterone was given to men with limited mobility.
Finally, there is little evidence that testosterone adds to existing
erythropoietin agents in the treatment of anemia in ESRD. Due to lack of evidence
supporting long-term use of testosterone, the authors recommend against the
routine use of testosterone in ESRD patients with low testosterone levels.
Testosterone treatment can be considered in those with low bone mass and total
testosterone level <200 ng/dl, or in younger patients with sexual complaints with
total testosterone level lower than the reference range. It is important to
engage patients in discussion of risks and benefits before initiating
testosterone therapy; testosterone therapy should be discontinued if the intended
treatment effect is not observed after short-term use.

Hemodialysis (HD) is routinely offered to patients with end-stage renal disease
in the United States who are ineligible for other renal replacement modalities.
The frequency of HD among the US population is greater than all other countries, 
except Taiwan and Japan. In US, patients are often dialyzed irrespective of age, 
comorbidities, prognosis, or decision-making capacity. Determination of when
patients can no longer dialyze is variable and can be dialysis-center specific.
Determinants may be related to progressive comorbidities and frailty, mobility or
access issues, patient self-determination, or an inability to tolerate the
treatment safely for any number of reasons (e.g., hypotension, behavioral
issues). Behavioral issues may impact the safety of not only patients themselves,
but also those around them. In this article the authors present the case of an
elderly patient on HD with progressive cognitive impairment and combative
behavior placing him and others at risk of physical harm. The authors discuss the
medical, ethical, legal, and psychosocial challenges to care of such patients who
lack decision-making capacity with a focus on variable approaches by regions and 
culture. This manuscript provides recommendations and highlights resources to
assist nephrologists, dialysis personnel, ethics consultants, and palliative
medicine teams in managing such patients to resolve conflict.

BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides
(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

The end-stage renal disease population is aging. Nearly half of all new patients 
are older than 65 years and one third are older than 70 years. Assessing the
possibility of transplantation for older patients with end-stage renal disease
often involves contemplating more complex issues, including cognitive impairment,
decreased functional status, and frailty, which makes selecting appropriate
candidates more difficult. Older transplant recipients have decreased patient and
transplant survival compared with younger recipients. For example, 75% of
deceased donor transplant recipients aged 30-49 years are alive after 5 years
compared to only 61% for those older than 65 years. Despite poorer outcomes
compared with younger recipients, older transplant recipients have a significant 
improvement in survival compared with similar patients who remain on the wait
list, with decreases in mortality of 41%-61% depending on the study. Use of
living donors, even older living donors, provides significantly better outcomes
for elderly recipients compared with the use of deceased donors. However, in the 
absence of a living donor, survival is improved significantly by accepting an
expanded criteria donor organ rather than waiting for a standard criteria
deceased donor. Older transplant recipients experience more infectious
complications and less acute rejection, but the risk of transplant loss from
rejection is increased compared with younger patients. These immunologic issues, 
along with the fact that older patients often are excluded from transplant
trials, have made selecting an ideal immunosuppressive regimen challenging.
Prospective comparative trials of different agents in the elderly population are 
warranted to better define the risk-benefit profile. This review discusses
transplantation outcomes, including patient and transplant survival, different
donor types, quality of life, and immunosuppression for older dialysis patients.

Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease among older adults: a focus on the oldest 
old.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 
(KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation,
Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of
kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease
to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of
older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress
to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific
cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older
adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have
shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated 
with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis)
and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally
thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes 
include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research
studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD 
and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the
longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the
oldest old with CKD.

BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and
its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we
hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between
earlier dialysis initiation and mortality.
METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis
Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident
patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for
vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization
through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the 
association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards
regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization.
RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73%.
In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with 
higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25-1.97]; P < .001) and time to first
hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45]; P < .001). While higher eGFR at
dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23]
per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically
significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the 
United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation.
Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier
initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described
association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic dialysis have
higher mortality in the United States than in many other countries. While
increasing age, white race, male sex, and/or diabetes are considered risk factors
for survival, few studies of older dialysis patients have simultaneously
considered multiple predictor variables and their interactions. Using information
contained in the 1982 to 1986 ESRD Network 20 database for Georgia and South
Carolina, we studied hospitalizations and survival of 1,354 blacks and 965 whites
who were age 60 years or older when they began dialysis therapy. Survival time
was modeled using the Cox life-table regression method. Older blacks' median age 
at dialysis initiation was 67.4, compared with 68.7 for older whites (P = 0.001).
Blacks were more likely than whites (P < 0.001) to have hypertension-related or
diabetes-related ESRD. White patients experienced approximately 25% more
hospitalization when adjustment was made for patient-days at risk. Separate
multivariate survival models were required for patients with diabetes-related
versus non-diabetes-related ESRD. Among diabetics, mortality was higher among
whites and among patients who were older when they began dialysis. Among patients
with non-diabetes-related ESRD, mortality was higher among patients who were
older when they began dialysis, but the age effect was much stronger for white
males. Our hospitalization and mortality data support the view that unmeasured
severity (or frailty) differences characterize white as compared with black
dialysis patients. Among non-diabetes-related ESRD patients, the age effect on
survival was more severe in white males than in blacks or in white females. The
high mortality we observed among older dialysis patients in Georgia and South
Carolina warrants further study; the data may in part reflect patients' lower
socioeconomic status compared with age, race, and sex-matched controls.
