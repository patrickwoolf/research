Diabetes mellitus affects over 20% of people aged > 65 years. With the population
of older people living with diabetes growing, the condition may be only one of a 
number of significant comorbidities that increases the complexity of their care, 
reduces functional status and inhibits their ability to self-care. Coexisting
comorbidities may compete for the attention of the patient and their healthcare
team, and therapies to manage comorbidities may adversely affect a person's
diabetes. The presence of renal or liver disease reduces the types of
antihyperglycemic therapies available for use. As a result, insulin and
sulfonylurea-based therapies may have to be used, but with caution. There may be 
a growing role for sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in
diabetic renal disease and for glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 therapy in renal and
liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). Cancer treatments pose considerable
challenges in glucose therapy, especially the use of cyclical chemotherapy or
glucocorticoids, and cyclical antihyperglycemic regimens may be required.
Clinical trials of glucose lowering show reductions in microvascular and, to a
lesser extent, cardiovascular complications of diabetes, but these benefits take 
many years to accrue, and evidence specifically in older people is lacking.
Guidelines recognize that clinicians managing patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus need to be mindful of comorbidity, particularly the risks of
hypoglycemia, and ensure that patient-centered therapeutic management of diabetes
is offered. Targets for glucose control need to be carefully considered in the
context of comorbidity, life expectancy, quality of life, and patient wishes and 
expectations. This review discusses the role of chronic kidney disease, chronic
liver disease, cancer, severe mental illness, ischemic heart disease, and frailty
as comorbidities in the therapeutic management of hyperglycemia in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The aortic valve is a semilunar valve with three leaflets, which lies at the
junction of left ventricle and aorta. It allows unidirectional blood flow from
the left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. Because of the highly
complex and sophisticated cellular and molecular functions, the thin valve
leaflet can withstand extreme mechanical and hemodynamic forces with every
cardiac cycle.[1] Various factors including age and congenital defects can
compromise the normal valvular function leading to a wide variety of
complications.[2] Although bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are the most common
congenital abnormality, congenital valve defects can range from aortic atresia
(missing or incomplete closure of aortic valves) to a sub or supra-valvular
stenosis. BAV is reported to have an incidence of 1 to 2% with a male
predominance. Lack of microfibrillar proteins during valvulogenesis has been
reported to affect the leaflet development where two leaflets are fused to form
one large leaflet. It frequently correlates with aortic abnormalities such as
aortic dilation (root, ascending and arch) and coarctation of the aorta.[3] The
bicuspid aortic valve leaflets can undergo accelerated calcific degeneration
because of abnormal hemodynamic forces. Congenital abnormalities including BAV
can lead to various valvular complications including aortic stenosis and aortic
regurgitation leading to an increased risk to infective endocarditis, which has a
reported incidence of 12 to 39% in BAV.[3] Unless severe, BAV generally remains
asymptomatic till the age of 50 to 60 years. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a narrowing 
of the valve aperture reducing the aortic valve area. Increased resistance to
blood flow and transvalvular pressure gradient causes increased left ventricle
workload causing hypertrophy. Its prevalence increases with age and can be as
high as 4.6% in people greater than age 75 years. Being the most common valvular 
disease in Europe and America, estimates are that 3.5 million people in England
alone will have AS by the year 2020.[4] Calcific degeneration leading to
stiffening and restriction motion of valve leaflet is the most common cause of
AS. Disruption of endothelium lining on the aortic side caused by increased
mechanical stress seem to be the inciting event. Posterior leaflets are
reported to be affected the most.[5] Rheumatic fever causing inflammation of the 
leaflets is still the leading cause of AS in developing countries. AS can be
asymptomatic or can cause symptoms of syncope, angina and heart
failure.[6] Severe AS is fatal with a 50% mortality at 2 years.[7] As per The
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines,
AS is graded severe when the orifice area is less than 1.0 cm, the mean gradient 
is greater than 40 mmHg or the jet velocity is greater than 4 m/s. Prognosis is
poor in symptomatic or severe cases unless the valve is replaced. Up to 30% of
patients aged > 75 do not undergo surgical valve replacement either because of
technical reasons; this may include porcelain aorta, general frailty, refusal to 
undergo surgery, and serious comorbid conditions.[8] The operative death risk for
surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is as high as 10% in patients with LV
dysfunction, chronic renal disease, and advanced age.[9] Trans-catheter aortic
valve replacement and trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR/TAVI) have
emerged as a more feasible and less risky option for patients not suitable for
surgery. Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the backflow of blood from the aorta to the
left ventricle when the valve leaflets fail to coapt. Common causes include
congenital defects, calcific degeneration, infective endocarditis, rheumatic
fever, and trauma.[10][11][12][13] Ventricular hypertrophy in chronic cases
accommodates increased volume to maintain the normal stroke volume and
end-diastolic pressure; hence, chronic AR can be asymptomatic for decades.[14] In
contrast, with acute cases of AR, ventricles do not have enough time to undergo
the needed changes such as hypertrophy to accommodate increased volumes. Because 
of decreased stroke volume, the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output
but is insufficient to meet the demand resulting in increased left atrial
pressure, pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. On physical examination, AR
murmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after
the aortic component of S (A); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal
intercostal space. It also has associations with various other murmurs including:
“Mid-systolic murmur” because of rapid ejection of an overload of blood from the 
left ventricle, “Austin Flint” murmur is mid-to-late diastolic murmur due
to partial closure of mitral valve during ventricular systole because of
regurgitant flow from aortic valve, “Cole-Cecil” is a diastolic murmur due to the
fusion of an aortic murmur with the S3 because of simultaneous filling of the
left ventricle from left atrium and AR. History of valvular surgery Dr. Theodore 
Tuffier, in 1912, used his finger to free the fused leaflets of a stenosed aortic
valve.[15] Before the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mitral valve repair
involved commissurotomy through access from the left atrial chamber. Thomas Homes
Sellors performed first pulmonary valvulotomy in 1948 by using a tenotomy
knife.[16] Charles Hufnagel developed the first artificial valve based on a
reciprocating ball and cage. It was used to prevent backflow of blood into the
ventricles due to aortic insufficiency.[17] CPB machine revolutionized the valve 
replacement in the anatomical position. Dr. Dwight Harken and his colleagues
performed the first successful aortic valve replacement. Later that year, Drs.
Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards performed mitral valve replacement.[18]
Bioprosthetic valves are closer in function to natural valves but have a limited 
life expectancy, whereas, Mechanical valves are more durable but require
anticoagulation. The choice of valves, among other factors, depends upon the
patient’s age and well-being. Mechanical heart valves are known to last for
approximately 25 years. Seventy different mechanical heart valves have been
developed since 1960.[19] Ball and cage, bi-leaflet, and tilting disc are the
common ones. Modification of the ball valve by Dr. Albert Starr and Lowell
Edwards entailed developing a cage made of lucite with a silicone elastomer ball.
The cage material was later changed to stainless steel and then cobalt-chromium
alloys. The Starr-Edward valve also has a Teflon sewing ring, which enabled
suturing into mitral and later into the aortic position.[20]  Increased
thrombogenicity has been a significant issue, for which valves underwent several 
modifications such as measures to reduce metal contact by covering the struts
with cloth and using Silastic shields. Other issues included hemolysis due to
excessive rubbing of the ball against the sewing ring and occlusion of coronary
ostia because of high profile. Despite these issues, these valves showed the
feasibility of prosthetic valve enabling Starr-Edwards to draw design criteria.
Basic points included that the valves should be chemically inert, biocompatible, 
a-traumatic to blood, and non-thrombogenic.[21]  In 1965, Kay-Shiley’s
non-rotating disc valve replaced the ball with a single disc but demonstrated
poor hemodynamics and hemolysis and was discontinued. Bjork-Shiley in 1969
developed a tilting-disc valve, which overcame the problems with the single-disc 
valve. Free rotation of disc between metal struts allows it to open by tilting at
a 60-degree angle. Bjork-Shiley replaced the flat with the convexo-concave disc
to create a larger orifice in 1975 but were the object of a recall due to
fracture of welded struts.[22]  Medtronic Hall valve developed by Dr. Karl Hall
and Robert Kaster is the most common tilting disc valve. Perforation in the
middle of the disc served as a guide and an improved tilting angle.[23] In 1977, 
St Jude Medical developed Bi-leaflet valve, which comprised two semi-circular
flaps with hinges close to the center of the orifice. Stagnation of blood flow
leading to thrombus formation around the hinge region was a problem with the
bi-leaflet valve.[15] A newly developed valve resolved this issue with a valve in
which the continuous 360-degree rotation around the central axis of the valve
ensured an even distribution of blood flow and prevent thrombus formation.[16] 
Predisposition for thrombosis, embolism, need for lifelong anticoagulation
therapy are drawbacks of mechanical valves. Bioprosthetic valves can either be an
allograft (cadaver or Ross procedure) or, a xenograft (native or pericardium).
The Ross procedure involves replacing the diseased aortic valve with the
patient’s own pulmonary valve (autograft) and replace the pulmonary valve with
aortic or pulmonary allograft. The pulmonary autograft grows with the patient and
does not induce an immunologic response. The most common xenografts are porcine
aortic valves and bovine pericardial valves. Lonescu-Shiley developed xenograft
valves by using bovine pericardium on a titanium stent in 1971 but was later
withdrawn in 1987 due to structural failure including abrasive tears because of
fabric-tissue interface and leaflet calcification. Carpentier-Edwards bovine
pericardial valve overcame those issues by making some structural modifications, 
like stitching pericardium to the inside of the fabric and using flexible stent
posts. Although biological valves have better hemodynamics compared to mechanical
valves, they have a shorter lifespan because of calcification, which stiffens the
valve leaflets. Tissues engineering, a field in regenerative medicine restores
and maintains the function of living tissues. Skin graft for burn victims is an
example. Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) are perceived to be
non-thrombogenic, and infection resistant. With advancement in material science
and culturing techniques, there is the possibility of a TEHV valve that
is capable of growing, remodeling and repairing itself as the patients grow.
Polymeric valves have been around for over 50 years, but because the earlier
versions were prone to calcification and degradation, they were not widely used
and instead only used in bridge devices like artificial hearts and left
ventricular assist devices. Besides the advantage that they can be produced in
various shapes and sizes,[17] they are known to combine the durability of
mechanical valves and the hydrodynamic function of bioprosthetic valves.[18] The 
earliest polymeric valve implanted in a 44-year-old female in 1958 at the mitral 
position was a polyurethane design with Teflon chordae
tendinae.[18][18][24] Polyurethane valves have been found to have better
hemodynamics compared to bioprosthetic valves and a lower incidence of
thrombogenicity than mechanical valves. With advances in material sciences, the
future of polymeric valves seems promising.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients with multiple comorbidities may be at higher risk of
postoperative complications. With an increasingly aging population, more data
assessing for predisposing factors are needed in this at-risk group. In this
study, we analyzed the effect of elderly status on relative comorbidities and
complications of sinonasal cancer (SNC) patients receiving surgery.
METHODS: A retrospective database analysis was performed using cases from the
Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2003 to 2012. Patients with a diagnosis of
malignant neoplasm of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses, who received surgery
for sinonasal malignancy, including neck dissections, were selected. Demographics
of interest included age, sex, race, type of admission, mean length of stay, and 
median hospital charges. Elderly and nonelderly patients were compared for
differences in rates of acute medical complications, acute surgical
complications, and relevant procedures during hospitalization.
RESULTS: Of the 920 cases identified in the NIS, 382 (41.5%) were elderly (≥65
years). Cases of SNC were more frequently seen in males than females (p < 0.001).
Elderly patients had significantly higher comorbidity rates compared with
nonelderly patients, which included congestive heart failure, hypertension,
diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and chronic renal failure (p < 0.001 for
all). Elderly patients more frequently had postoperative cardiac complications
(6.0% vs 0.5%, p < 0.001), but this finding was not statistically significant on 
multivariate analysis when controlling for race, sex, and comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: Elderly status is not an independent factor for postoperative
complications in patients undergoing surgery for sinonasal malignancy.

Motor functions are deteriorated by aging. Some conditions may magnify this
deterioration. This study examined whether hemodialysis (HD) process would
negatively impact gait and balance beyond diabetes condition among mid-age adults
(48⁻64 years) and older adults (65+ years). One hundred and ninety-six subjects
(age = 66.2 ± 9.1 years, body-mass-index = 30.1 ± 6.4 kg/m², female = 56%) in 5
groups were recruited: mid-age adults with diabetes undergoing HD (Mid-age HD+, n
= 38) and without HD (Mid-age HD-, n = 40); older adults with diabetes undergoing
HD (Older HD+, n = 36) and without HD (Older HD-, n = 37); and non-diabetic older
adults (Older DM-, n = 45). Gait parameters (stride velocity, stride length, gait
cycle time, and double support) and balance parameters (ankle, hip, and center of
mass sways) were quantified using validated wearable platforms. Groups with
diabetes had overall poorer gait and balance compared to the non-diabetic group
(p < 0.050). Among people with diabetes, HD+ had significantly worsened gait and 
balance when comparing to HD- (Cohen's effect size d = 0.63⁻2.32, p < 0.050).
Between-group difference was more pronounced among older adults with the largest 
effect size observed for stride length (d = 2.32, p < 0.001). Results suggested
that deterioration in normalized gait speed among HD+ was negatively correlated
with age (r = -0.404, p < 0.001), while this correlation was diminished among
HD-. Interestingly, results also suggested that poor gait among Older HD- is
related to poor ankle stability, while no correlation was observed between poor
ankle stability and poor gait among Older HD+. Using objective assessments,
results confirmed that the presence of diabetes can deteriorate gait and balance,
and this deterioration can be magnified by HD process. Among HD- people with
diabetes, poor ankle stability described poor gait. However, among people with
diabetes undergoing HD, age was a dominate factor describing poor gait
irrespective of static balance. Results also suggested feasibility of using
wearable platforms to quantify motor performance during routine dialysis clinic
visit. These objective assessments may assist in identifying early deterioration 
in motor function, which in turn may promote timely intervention.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 2% to 4% of patients with
severe aortic stenosis. It is because these patients have been excluded from
clinical trials, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in 
this patient group has not been thoroughly investigated. Between April 2008 and
March 2015, 2,000 patients (dialysis group, n = 56 [2.8%]) were consecutively
enrolled when diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and eligible to undergo TAVI.
Procedural and longer-term outcomes were analyzed and adjusted for differences in
baseline characteristics. Patients on dialysis had a higher periprocedural
mortality (10.7% vs 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 5.65, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.91 to 16.67; p = 0.002) and a lower Valve Academic Research
Consortium (VARC)-II (VARC) defined device success (adjOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to
0.79; p = 0.012). At 30 days, there was an increased rate of all-cause mortality 
(21.4 vs 4.8%; adjOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.96 to 12.26; p = 0.001), cardiovascular
(adjOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.41; p = 0.007) and noncardiovascular mortality
(adjOR 6.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 9.41; p = 0.019), myocardial infarction (adjOR 9.39, 
95% CI 1.84 to 48.03; p = 0.007), bleeding (adjOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.83;
p = 0.036) as well as the VARC-II defined early safety combined end point (adjOR 
2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.90; p = 0.012) associated with dialysis. Dialysis was
associated with poor survival at one (57.1% vs 84.2%) and 3 years (26.8% vs
66.9%) with or without the consideration of the first 72 hours (p <0.001;
adjusted p <0.001). Although, in the multivariable regression analysis, reduced
ejection fraction, peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH),
frailty and dialysis were associated with 1-year mortality, only PH (>60 mm Hg)
remained significant in an analysis restricted to the dialysis patients (adjusted
hazard ratio 2.68; 95% CI 1.18 to 5.88; p = 0.018). PH had a sensitivity of
45.8%, a specificity of 81.3%, and a positive predictive value of 64.7%. In
conclusion, dialysis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who
underwent TAVI. Long-term mortality in dialysis patients appears to be largely
determined by the kidney disease and/or dialysis itself whereas VARC-II defined
complications are largely unaffected. An increased short-term mortality still
calls for (pre-) procedural optimization.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are underrepresented in the studies concerning
anticoagulation therapy (AT) in atrial fibrillation (AF), while patients' frailty
status is lacking in most of the studies.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate AT in AF elderly patients and study the 
effect of patients' frailty status on their long-term AT.
METHODS: We conducted an observational prospective study that enrolled
consecutive AF patients (≥ 75 years) who were hospitalized in the Department of
Internal Medicine of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece from 1
June 2015 to 1 June 2016. We recorded the AT on admission and at discharge,
all-cause mortality, and hospital readmission in a follow-up period of 1 year
after hospital discharge. Frailty status was assessed by pre-established scores.
RESULTS: One hundred and four consecutive patients (49% male; median age
87 years) were enrolled, 78 (78.8%) of whom received AT at discharge. Patients
who did not receive AT at discharge had a higher HEMORR2HAGES (Hepatic or renal
disease, Ethanol abuse, Malignancy, Older age, Reduced platelet count or
function, Re-bleeding, Hypertension, Anemia, Genetic factors, Excessive fall risk
and Stroke) score (5.5 ± 1.15 vs. 4.79 ± 1.68; p = 0.032), a lower Katz score
(2.48 ± 2.23 vs. 4.08 ± 2.25; p = 0.006), and a higher Clinical Frailty Scale
score (7 ± 1.95 vs. 5.57 ± 2.05; p = 0.006). Sixty-five patients (62.5%) were
readmitted to a hospital during the follow-up period. In-hospital death occurred 
in five patients (4.8%) and 57 patients (57.6%) died within the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: A high percentage of the elderly AF patients did not receive AT, even
at discharge. Patients who did not receive AT at discharge had higher bleeding
and frailty scores. In the 1-year follow-up period after hospital discharge, high
all-cause mortality and a high number of hospital readmissions were recorded.

INTRODUCTION: Early toxic death (≤60 days of diagnosis) in elderly multiple
myeloma (MM) patients is attributable to active disease, age and co-morbidities. 
Rate of early toxic deaths is 10% with conventional chemotherapy mainly due to
infection and renal failure. Novel agents have improved MM outcome at the expense
of newer toxicity.
METHODS: We analyzed 1146 individual patient data to assess toxic deaths during
induction treatment with first-generation novel agents thalidomide, lenalidomide,
bortezomib.
RESULTS: During first-line therapy, 119/1146 patients (10%) died for any cause,
and 47/1146 (4%) due to toxicity, including 12/1146 (1%) early deaths. The
24-month cumulative incidence was 4.1% without any difference between bortezomib 
(18/503 patients, 4%) and lenalidomide (29/643patients, 5%; p = 0.31). Toxic
deaths occurred in 34/1039 (3%) patients <80 years and 13/107 (12%) patients ≥80 
years. Causes were cardiac events (28%), infections (26%) and vascular
complications (15%). In a multivariate analysis, older age and unfavorable ISS
stage increased the risk of death.
CONCLUSION: First-generation novel agents significantly reduced toxic deaths
compared to conventional chemotherapy. One third of deaths during first-line
therapy were due to cumulative drug-related toxicities, thus supportive
approaches and prevention strategies should be optimized. The higher mortality
rate for toxicity in octogenarians confirms the need for a careful frailty
assessment.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects 10%-15% of the population, associates
with a range of complications-such as cardiovascular disease, frailty,
infections, muscle and bone disorders and premature ageing-that could be related 
to alterations of mitochondrial number, distribution, structure and function. As 
mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetics and the dynamic mitochondrial networks
directly or indirectly regulate numerous intra- and extracellular functions, the 
mitochondria have emerged as an important target for interventions aiming at
preventing or improving the treatment of complications in CKD. In this review, we
discuss the possible role of bioactive food compounds and exercise in the
modulation of the disturbed mitochondrial function in a uraemic milieu.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between body mass index (BMI) and
postoperative outcomes in elective paraesophageal hernia (PEH) repairs.
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent elective PEH repair in 
the ACS NSQIP database (2005-2015) was performed. Patients were stratified into
BMI groups (< 18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25.0-29.9, 30.0-34.9, 35-39.9, and ≥ 40.0 kg/m2)
according to the World Health Organization classification criteria. A
multivariable logistic regression model was developed to characterize the
association between BMI class and outcomes, including readmission, reoperation,
postoperative complications, and mortality.
RESULTS: The median (IQR) age of the 9641 patients who met inclusion criteria was
64 (55-72) and 72.7% were women. Across each BMI class, age, race, gender, type
of procedure, frailty index, smoking, and ASA class varied (p < 0.05).
Underweight patients (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) had an increased risk of mortality
(OR = 6.35, p < 0.05). Patients with a BMI 35-39.9 kg/m2 (OR = 0.65, p < 0.05)
and ≥ 40 kg/m2 (OR = 0.36, p < 0.001) were associated with a decreased risk for
readmissions.
CONCLUSION: Underweight patients have an increased risk for postoperative
mortality after elective PEH repair. Higher BMI was associated with a diminished 
risk for readmission, but not for mortality, reoperations, or overall
complications.

PURPOSE: Compared with cast treatment, surgery may expose patients with distal
radius fractures to undue risk. Surgical intervention in this cohort may offer
less benefit than previously thought and appropriate patient selection is
imperative. The modified Frailty Index (mFI) predicts complications after other
orthopedic surgeries. We hypothesized that this index would predict, and might
ultimately prevent, complications in patients older than 50 years with distal
radius fractures.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the American College of Surgeons-National
Surgery Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database, including patients
older than 50 years who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of a
distal radius fracture. A 5-item mFI score was then calculated for each patient. 
Postoperative complications, readmission and reoperation rates, as well as length
of stay (LOS) were recorded. Bivariate and multivariable statistical analysis was
then performed.
RESULTS: We identified 6,494 patients (mean age, 65 years). Compared with
patients with mFI of 0, patients with mFI of 2 or greater were nearly 2.5 times
as likely to incur a postoperative complication (1.7% vs 7.4%). Specifically, the
rates of Clavien-Dindo IV, wound, cardiac, and renal complications were increased
significantly in patients with mFI of 2 or greater. In addition, as mFI increased
from 0 to 2 or greater, 30-day reoperation rate increased from 0.8% to 2.4%,
30-day readmission from 0.8% to 4.6%, and LOS from 0.5 days to 1.44 days. Frailty
was associated with increased complications as well as rates of readmission and
reoperation even when controlling for demographic data, LOS, and operative time. 
Age alone was not significantly associated with postoperative complications,
readmission, reoperation, or LOS.
CONCLUSIONS: A state of frailty is highly predictive of postoperative
complications, readmission, reoperation, and increased LOS following open
reduction and internal fixation of distal radius fractures. Our data suggest that
a simple frailty evaluation can help inform surgical decision making in patients 
older than 50 years with distal radius fractures.

Ever since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in
1995, HIV infection has been linked to "metabolic" complications (insulin
resistance, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and others). Studies suggested increased 
rates of myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency, neurocognitive dysfunction, 
and fractures in HIV-postitive patients. Even long-term suppression of HIV seemed
to be accompanied by an excess of deleterious inflammation that could promote
these complications. The aims of this viewpoint paper are to summarize recent
data and to examine the possibility that the problem of aging-related morbidity
in HIV might not be as dramatic as previously believed.

Depression and Physical Frailty Have Additive Effect on the Nutritional Status
and Clinical Outcome of Chinese Peritoneal Dialysis.

Szeto CC, Chan GC, Ng JK, Chow KM, Kwan BC, Cheng PM, Kwong VW, Law MC, Leung CB,
Li PK.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frailty and depression both contribute to malnutrition and
adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, their
interaction is incompletely defined.
METHODS: We studied 178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed 
by a validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by the
Geriatric Depression Scale; nutritional status was determined by subjective
global assessment (SGA) and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS). All patients
were followed for up to 24 months for survival and hospitalization analysis.
RESULTS: There were 111 patients (62.4%) physically frail, amongst those 48
(43.2%) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without
frailty. There was an additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty
on nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty, frail but no depressive
symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin decreased in a
stepwise manner (35.8 ± 5.6, 34.9 ± 4.4, and 32.9 ± 5.3 g/L, respectively,
p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 ± 0.61, 5.41 ± 0.59, and 5.04 ± 0.77,
respectively (p< 0.0001), and MIS was 5.12 ± 2.30, 7.13 ± 3.22, and 9.48 ± 3.97, 
respectively (p< 0.0001). At 24 months, patient survival was 86.6%, 71.4%, and
62.5% for patients with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail
with depressive symptoms, respective (p=0.001). The median number of hospital
stay was 8.04 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.91 - 19.42), 14.05 (IQR 3.57 -
37.27), and 26.62 (IQR 10.65 - 61.18) days per year of follow up, respectively
(p< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Physical frailty and depressive symptoms are both common in Chinese
PD patients, and they have additive adverse effect on the nutritional status and 
clinical outcome.

Background  The burden of frail patients undergoing emergency general surgery
(EGS) is increasing rapidly and this population is particularly susceptible to
postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and mortality. We aimed to determine 
the association between frailty, as defined by the previously described modified 
frailty index (mFI), and postoperative respiratory complications (unplanned
reintubation, pneumonia, and prolonged ventilation), cardiac complications
(myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest), and mortality. We also sought to
identify the most significant determinants of frailty in the highest risk
patients based on the specific variables comprising the mFI. Methods  We
performed a retrospective observational analysis of the prospectively collected
American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
database. Files from 2005 to 2015 identified 132,765 inpatients who underwent
EGS. mFI scores were calculated for each patient. The effect of increasing
frailty on unplanned reintubation, pneumonia, prolonged ventilation, myocardial
infarction, cardiac arrest, and mortality was evaluated using bivariate analysis.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare mFI with additional
predictor variables including race, gender, physical status as defined by the
American Society of Anesthesiologists, disseminated cancer, renal failure,
smoking status, sepsis, wound presence/classification, dyspnea, and previous
ventilator dependence. Results  Unplanned reintubation, pneumonia, prolonged
ventilation, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and mortality were
significantly associated with frailty, and the odds of each postoperative
complication increased with increasing mFI score. Of the frailest patients (mFI
≥3) that experienced cardiopulmonary complications or mortality, the variables of
the mFI that contributed most to frailty were hypertension requiring medication
and functional status before surgery. Conclusions  A higher mFI score is
associated with increased odds of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and
mortality in the EGS population. Specific variables of the mFI can also provide
valuable information for assessing odds in the frailest patients undergoing EGS.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty can be defined as a biological syndrome of reduced reserve 
and resistance to stressful events. Evidence suggests that this syndrome is
linked to adverse outcomes in various surgical populations. Several instruments
have been developed to measure frailty, however there is no consensus about which
one is the most useful in the surgical population. Therefore, this study aims to 
evaluate the utility of different frailty scales in the prediction of
postoperative complications in older surgical population.
METHODS: This review and meta-analysis assembles prospective cohort studies
reporting frailty and postoperative outcomes. Searches were performed in
PubMed/Medline, Scielo, Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect databases. Statistical
analyses was performed using Review Manager software and the pooled Odds Rattios 
was calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 15 articles were included in the present review. Frailty was 
significantly associated with postoperative complications (OR=2.53, 95% CI:
2.07-3.10; p<0.00001), mortality until 30 days (OR=3.49, 95% CI: 2.40-5.09,
p<0.00001) and higher 1-year mortality (OR= 2.90, 95% CI: 1.99-4.24, p<0.00001), 
and with hospital length of stay >5days or >14days (OR=2.78, 95% CI: 1.45-5.30,
p=0.002 and OR=2.40 (95% CI: 1.08-5.36, p= 0.03, respectively). In addition, our 
meta-analysis showed that frailty is a significant predictor of renal failure
(OR=5.03, 95% CI: 1.74-14.54, p=0.003), neurological complications (OR= 3.41, 95%
CI: 1.08-10.73, p=0.04), respiratory complications (OR=9.21 (95% CI: 2.35- 36.02,
p=0.001), wound infection (OR=2.85 (95% CI: 1.65-4.94, p=0.0002) and sepsis
(OR=3.84 (95% CI: 1.37-10.71, p=0.01).
CONCLUSION: Overall, frailty significantly increases the risk for developing
adverse outcomes after surgery, so early detection of frailty may be a window of 
opportunity for intervention and a key factor for improving clinical outcomes.
Moreover, future studies are required for the standardization of the frailty
scales used.

Frailty in the elderly population is an important predictor of surgical outcomes.
It has been quantified by several models, including the modified frailty index,
which has demonstrated applicability in many surgical subspecialties. We aim to
conduct the first decade-long retrospective analysis of frailty and complications
between open and laparoscopic colectomy. We used the American College of Surgeons
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to identify colectomies
performed between 2005 and 2014. Our primary outcome was 30-day mortality.
Secondary outcomes were grouped into five categories: wound, hematologic,
pulmonary, renal, or cardiac/vascular complications. Chi-square and multivariate 
logistic regression were used to identify significant predictors of outcomes. Of 
the 244,639 colectomies identified in our data set, 117,064 cases were included
after exclusion criteria were applied. 42,192 (36%) cases were laparoscopic.
Mortality rates among open colectomies in mFI cohorts 0, 1, 2, 3, and ≥ 4 were
1.2, 3.4, 7.9, 14.3, and 20.3%, respectively, while rates in laparoscopic
colectomies 0.2, 0.7, 2, 3.5, and 5.4%, respectively (p < 0.05). Logistic
regression showed increase likelihood of mortality with open colectomies in all
mFI cohorts (p < 0.05). The open approach also had statistically significant
higher rates of secondary outcomes in nearly all frailty levels. Our study
analyzed the relationship of frailty, approach to colectomy, and postoperative
complications. Laparoscopic colectomies resulted in lower mortality rates as well
as less wound, hematologic, pulmonary, renal, and cardiovascular complications.

The number of elderly people has increased considerably over the last decades,
due to a rising life expectancy and ageing populations. As a result, an increased
number of elderly with end-stage-renal-disease are diagnosed, for which the
preferred treatment is renal transplantation. Over the past years the awareness
of the elderly as a specific patient population has grown, which increases the
importance of research in this group. Elderly patients often receive kidneys from
elderly donors while younger donor kidneys are preferentially reserved for
younger recipients. Although the rate of acute rejection after transplantation is
lower in the elderly, these rejections may lead to graft loss more frequently, as
kidneys from elderly donors have marginal reserve capacity. To prevent acute
rejection, immunosuppressive therapy is needed. On the other hand, elderly
patients have a higher risk to die from infectious complications, and thus less
immunosuppression would be preferable. Immunosuppressive treatment in the elderly
is complicated further by changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
with increasing age. Adjustments in standard immunosuppressive regimes are
therefore suggested for this population. An unmet need in transplantation
medicine is a tool to guide a personalized approach to immunosuppression.
Recently several promising biomarkers that identify injury to the graft at an
early stage or predict acute rejection have been identified. Unfortunately, none 
of these biomarkers were tested specifically in the elderly. We believe there is 
an urgent need to perform clinical trials investigating novel immunosuppressive
regimens in conjunction with biomarker studies in this specific population.

Objective Despite centralisation of the provision of vascular care, not all areas
in England and Wales are able to offer emergency treatment for patients with
acute conditions affecting the aorta proximal to the renal arteries. While
cardiothoracic centres have made network arrangements to coordinate care for the 
repair of type A dissections, a similar plan for vascular care is lacking. This
study investigates early outcomes in patients with ruptured suprarenal aortic
aneurysm or dissection (rSRAD) transferred to a specialist centre. Methods
Retrospective observational study over a five-year period (2009-2014) assessing
outcomes of patients with ruptured sRAD diagnosed at their local hospital and
then transferred to a tertiary centre capable of offering such treatment. Results
Fifty-two patients (median age 73 years, 32 male) with rSRAD were transferred and
a further four died during transit. The mean distance of patient transfer was 35 
miles (range 4-211 miles). One patient did not undergo intervention due to
frailty and two died before reaching the operating theatre. A total of 23
patients underwent endovascular repair, 9 hybrid repair and 17 open surgery.
Median follow-up was 12 months (range 1-43 months). Complications included
paraplegia (n = 3), stroke (n = 2), type IA endoleak (n = 4); 30-day and
in-hospital mortality were 16% and 27%. For patients discharged alive from
hospital, one-year survival was 67%. Conclusions Although the number of patients 
with rSRAD is low and those who are transferred alive are a self-selecting group,
this study suggests that transfer of such patients to a specialist vascular
centre is associated with acceptable mortality rates following emergency complex 
aortic repair.

[Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes in Older Adults: Example for Patient-Centered Drug
Therapy].

[Article in German]

Müller-Wieland D.

Diabetes in older adults has a high prevalence and is frequently associated with 
comorbidities of the cardiovascular system, dysfunction of cognition as well as
depression and impaired mobility or increased frailty. Furthermore, impaired
renal function, heart failure, risk for hypoglycemia and polypharmacy has to be
considered in the decision about the diabetes treatment strategy. The goal of
blood glucose management is driven by patient relevant issues and patient
self-esteem, quality of life defined by the patient, preservation of physical and
social mobility rather than potential long-term effects on reduction of cardio-
and microvascular events in the future, which is limited by patient-inherent
reduced life expectancy of the aged individual. Therefore, long-term diabetes
medication should avoid hypoglycemia and prevent acute hyperglycemia or
short-term complications on morbidity and clinical course of geriatric syndromes 
associated with regular blood glucose levels above 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l). The
therapy should be safe, easy to handle for the patient and possibly affect
co-morbidities positively. However, there are limited data available about
efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of drugs in patients over 75 years of age
or older. Since more than 5 % of the population in Germany is older than 80 years
means that more than 1 million of these individuals suffer from diabetes. It is
time to ask for data in these elderly subpopulations by policy makers in health
care.

Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of
diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, 
about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years.
Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive
impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly
more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial
disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a
consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a
considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without
any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with
type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into
account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life
expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals
and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically,
overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in
particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used
with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia
are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function
are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcopenia and muscle weakness contribute to fragility and
limit exercise tolerance among patients with CKD. This review focuses on the role
of reduction in mitochondrial mass and function in the myopathy associated with
CKD, causes for these muscle mitochondrial abnormalities, and potential
therapeutic interventions that may improve mitochondrial biogenesis and function 
as well as skeletal muscle function and performance in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial structure, function, and
composition have been shown in both experimental models and patients with CKD. A 
significant reduction in mitochondrial respiratory function and an increase in
mitochondrial complex 1 enzyme activity has been demonstrated in the muscle
tissue of male Sprague-Dawley rats following 5/6 nephrectomy. These changes were 
associated with a substantial reduction in skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass. In
patients with CKD, in-vivo magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy show
significantly elevated resting skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and lower mean 
mitochondrial coupling ratio indicating disrupted muscle mitochondrial metabolism
and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Skeletal muscle biopsies from
patients with advanced CKD show lower mitochondrial volume density and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number than controls.
SUMMARY: Advanced CKD is associated with decreased exercise capacity, skeletal
muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. Impaired mitochondrial respiratory function,
reduced muscle mitochondrial mass, and decreased energy production in skeletal
muscle play a critical role in this 'acquired mitochondrial myopathy' of CKD. It 
is reasonable, therefore, to develop therapeutic interventions that enhance
mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as skeletal muscle function and
performance in patients with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that elective cardiac patients are at risk of
functional and psychological deterioration in the time preceding surgery. This
poses a risk to successful post-operative rehabilitation. This prospective
one-group pre-test, post-test evaluation was designed to assess a clinical
Pre-operative Rehabilitation (PREHAB) home-based exercise programme, to optimise 
pre-operative physical function and frailty in patients awaiting elective
Coronary Artery By-Pass Graft (CABG) or Valve Surgery.
METHOD: Consenting patients awaiting cardiac surgery, with wait time ≥ 6 weeks
were referred to a Senior Physiotherapist for baseline assessment. Patients were 
offered PREHAB in the form of functional home-based exercise that was prescribed 
from baseline physical outcomes. All patients were followed up via telephone to
ensure progression of exercise and any problems associated with it. This
continued weekly until the patient attended Surgical Pre-assessment clinic, where
all outcome measures were re-assessed.
RESULTS: Twenty two patients, out of a total number of 36 patients seen in the
surgical clinic between March 2016 and August 2016, participated in the prehab
clinical evaluation. Twenty patients completed their prescribed exercises on a
weekly basis prior to surgery. No adverse events or cardiac symptoms were
reported as a result of the home exercise intervention. Paired t-Test analyses
revealed a significant mean difference in clinical frailty score (CFS) of
-0.53 ± 0.51 (95% CI [-0.774, -0.279], P = 0.0003). Significant mean difference
in six-minute walk test (6MWT) distance of 42.5 ± 27.8 m (95% CI [23.840,
61.251], P = 0.0005), 6MWT walking speed of 0.5 ± 0.4kmh (95% CI, [0.2433,
0.7567], P = 0.001), and short physical performance battery (SPPB) total score of
2.2 ± 1.7, (95% CI [3.066, 1.200], P = 0.0002) were also observed. The change in 
6MWT distance was shown to be significantly associated with hospital length of
stay (LOS) (r = 0.7; P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: This small exploratory evaluation suggests that providing a
home-based PREHAB programme for frail patients undergoing CABG or Valve surgery
may be able to improve functional ability and reduce hospital length of stay for 
those patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A frailty score with greater
sensitivity may be required to elucidate the influence frailty could have in
reducing length of stay. A large randomised controlled study is required to
reveal the potential beneficial effects of PREHAB in this patient population.

Importance: Frailty is a measure of decreased physiological reserve that is
associated with morbidity and mortality in major elective and emergency general
surgery operations, independent of chronological age. To date, the association of
frailty with outcomes in ambulatory general surgery has not been established.
Objective: To determine the association between frailty and perioperative
morbidity in patients undergoing ambulatory general surgery operations.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 
140 828 patients older than 40 years of age from the 2007-2010 American College
of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use File
who underwent ambulatory and 23-hour-stay hernia, breast, thyroid, or parathyroid
surgery. Data analysis was performed from August 18, 2016, to June 21, 2017.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between the National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program modified frailty index and perioperative morbidity was
determined via multivariable logistic regression with random-effects modeling to 
control for clustering within Current Procedural Terminology codes.
Results: A total of 140 828 patients (80 147 women and 60 681 men; mean [SD] age,
59.3 [12.0] years) underwent ambulatory hernia (n = 71 455), breast (n = 51 267),
thyroid, or parathyroid surgery (n = 18 106). Of these patients, 2457 (1.7%)
experienced any type of perioperative complication and 971 (0.7%) experienced
serious perioperative complications. An increasing modified frailty index was
associated with a stepwise increase in the incidence of complications. In
multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, anesthesia type,
tobacco use, renal failure, corticosteroid use, and clustering by Current
Procedural Terminology codes, an intermediate modified frailty index score
(0.18-0.35, corresponding to 2-3 frailty traits) was associated with
statistically significant odds ratios of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.54-1.88; P < .001) for
any complication and 2.00 (95% CI, 1.72-2.34; P < .001) for serious
complications. A high modified frailty index score (≥0.36, corresponding to ≥4
frailty traits) was associated with statistically significant odds ratios of 3.35
(95% CI, 2.52-4.46; P < .001) for any complication and 3.95 (95% CI, 2.65-5.87;
P < .001) for serious complications. Anesthesia with local and monitored
anesthesia care was the only modifiable covariate associated with decreased odds 
of serious 30-day complications, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.66 (95% CI,
0.53-0.81; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: Frailty is associated with increased perioperative
morbidity in common ambulatory general surgery operations, independent of age,
type of anesthesia, and other comorbidities. Surgeons should consider frailty
rather than chronological age when counseling and selecting patients for elective
ambulatory surgery.

Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with higher mortality.
We aimed to identify the baseline predictors of in-hospital mortality among
elderly patients with non-valvular AF (NVAF) hospitalised for any reason.
METHODS: Observational, prospective and multicentre study was carried out on
patients with NVAF over the age of 75, who had been admitted for any acute
medical condition to Internal Medicine departments in Spain.
RESULTS: We evaluated 804 patients with a mean age of 85±5.1years, of which 53.9%
were females. During the hospitalization 10.1% (n=81) of the patients died. The
patients who died were older, had a greater percentage of institutionalization,
worse previous basic functional status (Barthel Index), worse cognitive
performance at admission and greater proportion of frailty and sarcopenia.
Logistic regression multivariate analysis identified that the strongest
determinants of in-hospital mortality were the baseline functional status
(Barthel Index) (OR for total dependency 4.73, 95% CI 2.32-9.63), and admissions 
for stroke (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.41-8.90) and acute renal failure (OR 1.93, 95% CI
1.12-3.32).
CONCLUSION: The overall in-hospital mortality of elderly patients with NVFA is
high. Among all factors evaluated in the global geriatric assessment the baseline
functional status was the strongest predictor for in-hospital mortality on this
population.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is highly prevalent in the dialysis population and is 
associated with mortality. Recent studies have suggested that other dialysis
outcomes are compromised in frail individuals. While we do not yet have a
consensus as to the best measure of frailty, identification of these poor
outcomes and their magnitude of association with frailty will help improve
prognostication, allow for earlier interventions, and improve provider-to-patient
communication.
RECENT FINDINGS: The most widely used assessment of frailty is Fried's physical
performance criteria. However, regardless of assessment method, frailty remains
highly associated with mortality. More recently, frailty has been associated with
falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, vascular access failure, and poor quality
of life. Recent large cohort studies provide strong evidence that frailty
assessment can provide important prognostic information for providers and
patients both before and after initiation of dialysis. Trials aimed at improving 
frailty are limited and show the promise of augmenting quality of life, although 
more studies are needed to firmly establish mortality benefits.
SUMMARY: We underscore the importance of frailty as a prognostic indicator and
identify other recently established consequences of frailty. Widespread adoption 
of frailty assessment remains limited and researchers continue to find ways of
simplifying the data collection process. Timely and regular assessment of frailty
may allow for interventions that can mitigate the onset of poor outcomes and
identify actionable targets for dialysis providers.

Update on pharmacological treatment of acute coronary syndrome without persistent

The increase in cardiovascular disease prevalence with ageing has been attributed
to several age-related changes such as changes in the vascular wall elasticity,
the coagulation and haemostatic system and endothelial dysfunction, among other
causes. There is a 50% increased mortality risk per 10-year increase in age
starting at 65 years old. Here, we aimed to discuss pharmacological treatment in 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without persistent ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction in the elderly. The main aim of ACS treatment in elderly people is at 
preventing ischemia, myocardial damage and complications. A meta-analysis
suggests that invasive revascularization therapy is probably most useful in older
patients. Dual antiplatelet therapy is currently the standard of care post-ACS.
Platelet P2Y12 inhibitors are among the most commonly used medications worldwide,
due to their established benefits in the treatment and prevention of arterial
thrombosis. The main recommendation is to tailor antithrombotic treatment,
considering body weight, renal function (Class I, level C) and careful evaluation
of life expectancy, comorbidities, risk/benefit profile, quality of life and
frailty when invasive strategies are considered (Class IIa, level A) on top of
the different recommendations given for a general non ST elevation ACS
population. It is obvious that potent P2Y12 inhibitors will continue to play an
important role in pharmacological treatment for elderly ACS patients in the
future.

BACKGROUND: Aortic valve replacement is a high-risk surgery (3%-5%, 30-day
mortality) performed on approximately 30,000 elderly patients a year in the
United States. Currently, preoperative risk assessment is based on a composite of
medical examination and a subjective evaluation for frailty ("eyeball test").
Objective frailty assessment using validated indices has the potential to improve
risk stratification. The purpose of this study was to (1) establish whether
frailty can predict 30-day mortality and composite morbidity in patients
undergoing aortic valve replacement and (2) compare the predictive ability of 3
frailty indices in this population.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study of 3088 patients 65 years
old and older undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery (based on current
procedure terminology codes) between the years 2006 and 2012 extracted from the
American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
database. Frailty was assessed using the modified frailty index, risk analysis
index, and Ganapathi indices. Outcomes measured were 30-day mortality and
composite morbidity (myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism,
pneumonia, reintubation, renal insufficiency, coma >24 hours, urinary tract
infections, sepsis, deep vein thrombosis, deep wound surgical site infection,
superficial site infection, and reoperation).
RESULTS: Frailty was a better predictor of mortality than morbidity, and it was
not markedly different among any of the 3 indices. Frailty was associated with an
increased risk of 30-day mortality and longer lengths of stay.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty can predict mortality in patients undergoing aortic valve
replacement. Choice of frailty index does not make a difference in this patient
population.

To assess whether biopsy-guided selection of kidneys from very old brain-dead
donors enables more successful transplantations, the authors of this multicenter,
observational study compared graft survival between 37 recipients of 1 or 2
histologically evaluated kidneys from donors older than 80 years and 198
reference-recipients of non-histologically evaluated single grafts from donors
aged 60 years and younger (transplantation period: 2006-2013 at 3 Italian
centers). During a median (interquartile range) of 25 (13-42) months, 2
recipients (5.4%) and 10 reference-recipients (5.1%) required dialysis (crude and
donor age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.55
[0.34-7.12], P = .576 and 1.41 [0.10-19.54], P = .798, respectively). Shared
frailty analyses confirmed similar outcomes in a 1:2 propensity score study
comparing recipients with 74 reference-recipients matched by center, year, donor,
and recipient sex and age. Serum creatinine was similar across groups during
84-month follow-up. Recipients had remarkably shorter waiting times than did
reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (7.5 [4.0-19.5] vs 36
[19-56] and 40 [24-56] months, respectively, P < .0001 for both comparisons).
Mean (± SD) kidney donor risk index was 2.57 ± 0.32 in recipients vs 1.09 ± 0.24 
and 1.14 ± 0.24 in reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients
(P < .0001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were similar across groups.
Biopsy-guided allocation of kidneys from octogenarian donors permits further
expansion of the donor organ pool and faster access to a kidney transplant,
without increasing the risk of premature graft failure.

OBJECTIVE: The present study assessed the predictive value of age and Modified
Frailty Index (mFI) on the management of primary epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) 
patients aged 70 years or older (elderly).
METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study selected elderly EOC patients treated 
between 2006 and 2014. Treatments were analyzed according to the following age
group categories: (1) 70 to 75 years versus (2) older than 75 years, and mFI of
less than 4 (low frailty) versus greater than or equal to 4 (high frailty).
RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were identified (40 in age group 1 and 38 in age 
group 2). The mFI was greater than or equal to 4 in 23 women. Median age of low
frailty and high frailty was not significantly different (75.6 vs 75.3).
Comorbidities were equally distributed according to age, whereas diabetes,
hypertension, obesity, and chronic renal failure were more frequent in the
high-frailty group. Performance status was different only according to mFI.
Twenty percent of age group 1 versus 55.3% of age group 2 underwent none or only 
explorative surgical approach (P = 0.003), whereas surgical approaches were
similar in the 2 frailty groups. The rate of postoperative complications was
higher in high-frailty patients compared with low-frailty patients (23.5% vs
4.3%; P = 0.03). Chemotherapy was administered to all the patients, a monotherapy
regimen to 50% of them. No differences in toxicity were registered, except more
hospital recovery in the high-frailty cohort. Median survival time was in favor
of younger patients (98 versus 30 months) and less-frailty patients (56 vs 27
months).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly EOC patients can receive an adequate treatment, but patients
who are older than 75 years can be undertreated, if not adequately selected. The 
pretreatment assessment of frailty through mFI could be suggested in the surgical
and medical management.

BACKGROUND: To explore relevant associations between deviations in linear and
nonlinear heart rate variability (HRV) scores, and short-term morbidity and
mortality in patients undergoing hip-surgery after a fracture.
METHODS: 165 patients with hip fractures being admitted for surgery at two
hospitals were included in a prospective cohort study. A short-term ECG was
recorded within 24 hours of arrival. 15 patients had to be excluded due to
insufficient quality of the ECG recordings. 150 patients were included in the
final analysis. Linear parameters were calculated in time domain: standard
deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences
(rMSSD); and frequency domain: Total Power (TP), High Frequency Power (HF), Low
Frequency Power (LF), Very Low Frequency Power (VLF), and the ratio of LF/HF.
Postoperative outcome was evaluated at the time of discharge. This included
occurrence of pneumonia, overall infection rate, stroke, myocardial infarction,
and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Patients experiencing complications had significantly lower rMSSD (p =
0.04), and TP (p = 0.03) preoperatively. Postoperative infections were predicted 
by decreased VLF preoperatively (p = 0.04). There was a significant association
between pneumonia and LF/HF<1 (p = 0.03). The likelihood ratio to develop
pneumonia when LF/HF < 1 was 6,1.
CONCLUSION: HRV seems to reflect the general frailty of the patient with hip
fracture and might be used to identify patients in need of increased surveillance
or prophylactic treatment.

BACKGROUND: Frailty has been increasingly used as a prognostic indicator for
various surgical operations. Patients with peripheral arterial disease represent 
a cohort of population with advanced medical comorbidities. The aim of this study
is to correlate the postoperative outcomes after lower extremity bypass surgery
with preoperative modified frailty index (mFI).
METHODS: Using 2010 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program database, patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial bypass
surgery were identified. mFI with 11 variables, based on the Canadian Study of
Health and Aging Frailty Index, was utilized. Based on mFI score, the patients
were divided into 4 groups: group 1 (mFI score: 0-0.09), group 2 (mFI score:
0.18-0.27), group 3 (mFI score: 0.36-0.45), and group 4 (mFI score: 0.54-0.63). A
bivariate and multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 4,704 patients (64% males and 36% females) underwent
infrainguinal arterial bypass. Mean age was 67.9 ± 11.7 years. Distribution of
patients based on mFI was as follows: group 1: 14.6%, group 2: 55.9%, group 3:
26.9%, and group 4: 2.6%. Increase in mFI was associated with higher mortality
rates. Incidence of mortality for group 1 was 0.6%; for group 2, it was 1.4%; for
group 3, it was 4%; and for group 4, it was 7.4%. Likewise, the incidence of
other postoperative complications such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke,
progressive renal failure, and graft failure was significantly high among
patients with high mFI scores. Following factors were associated with increased
risk of mortality: high mFI score, black race, dialysis dependency, postoperative
renal insufficiency, MI, and postoperative acute renal failure.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the mFI can be used as a valuable tool 
to identify patients at a higher risk for developing postoperative complications 
after lower extremity revascularization. For patients with mFI score of
0.54-0.63, the risk of mortality and complications increases significantly. mFI
can be used as a useful screening tool to identify patients who are at a high
risk for developing complications.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

OBJECTIVES: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been implemented
into the care of elderly patients suffering from severe symptomatic aortic
stenosis. However, data on long-term follow-up are sparse and predictors of
long-term mortality need to be evaluated to better select patients. Therefore, we
aimed to analyse predictors of 5-year mortality after TAVI.
METHODS: We analysed data from the German Transcatheter Aortic Valve
Interventions-Registry. Each of the 27 participating hospitals agreed to include 
all consecutive TAVI patients at their institution. Out of 1444 patients treated 
with TAVI, 1378 patients had a follow-up of at least 4.5 years (completeness
95.4%). Endpoint for this analysis was 5-year survival. Cox regression analysis
was used to determine risk factors associated with this endpoint.
RESULTS: Patients who died were compared with survivors. The two groups showed
multiple differences in patient characteristics, indications for interventions,
preinterventional, as well as interventional characteristics and
postinterventional events. Calculated 1-year mortality was 21.8% and 5-year
mortality 59.1%. A higher logistic EuroScore was associated with a lower 5-year
survival, being 45.5% in patients with a logistic EuroScore of <20%, 34.5% in
those with 20% to 40% and 28.4% in patients with a logistic EuroScore >40%. Cox
proportional hazard analysis revealed the following independent predictors of
5-year mortality: female gender (HR =0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.77, p<0.0001), renal 
failure (HR=1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.69, p<0.0001), prior mitral regurgitation ≥II°
(HR=1.42, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.65, p<0.0001), residual aortic regurgitation ≥II°
(HR=1.52, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.85, p<0.0001), atrial fibrillation (HR=1.38, 95% CI
1.18 to 1.64, p=0.0001), low gradient aortic stenosis (HR=1.48, 95% CI 1.19 to
1.84, p=0.0004), prior decompensation (HR=1.32, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.54, p=0.0006),
frailty (HR=1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.58, p=0.004), surgical TAVI (HR=1.42, 95% CI
1.12 to 1.80, p=0.004), age (by year) (HR=1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03, p=0.006),
prior myocardial infarction (HR=1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.57, p=0.009), urgent TAVI 
(HR=1.25, 95% CI 1.04 to 51, p=0.020) and diabetes mellitus (HR=1.20, 95% CI 1.02
to 1.40, p=0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: These data from the early TAVI experience show a 5-year mortality of
59.1%. Some of the predictors of 5-year mortality seem to be modifiable, such as 
residual aortic regurgitation, type of TAVI access route and concomitant mitral
regurgitation.

INTRODUCTION: This article ponders upon wearable medical measurement devices in
relation to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its' associated comorbidities - and 
whether these might benefit CKD-patients. We aimed to map the intersection(s) of 
nephrology and wearable sensor technology to help technologists understand
medical aspects, and clinicians to understand technological possibilities that
are available (or soon will become so). Areas covered: A structured literature
search on main comorbidities and complications CKD patients suffer from, was used
to steer mini-reviews on wearable sensor technologies clustered around 3 themes
being: Cardiovascular-related, diabetes-related and physical fitness/frailty.
This review excludes wearable dialysis - although also strongly enabled by
miniaturization - because that highly important theme deserves separate in-depth 
reviewing. Expert commentary: Continuous progress in integrated electronics
miniaturization enormously lowered price, size, weight and energy consumption of 
electronic sensors, processing power, memory and wireless connectivity. These
combined factors boost opportunities for wearable medical sensors. Such devices
can be regarded as enablers for: Remote monitoring, influencing human behaviour
(exercise, dietary), enhanced home care, remote consults, patient education and
peer networks. However, to make wearable medical devices succeed, the challenge
to fit them into health care structures will be dominant over the challenge to
realize the bare technologies themselves.

Radical cystectomy is associated with a high postoperative mortality and
morbidity in older patients. We aimed to define the predictive value of
comorbidity scores and determine the prognostic factors of postoperative
complications. Preoperative associated morbidities were collected and graded
according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score system, the
Adult Comorbidity Evaluation (ACE) scale and the Charlson comorbidity index.
Surgical complications were graded according to Clavien classification. Early and
late complications were recorded. Data are from 49 consecutive patients aged ≥ 75
years who had an open surgery for bladder cancer. The most commonly associated
conditions were smoking, renal insufficiency, and arterial hypertension.
Incidence of early and late complications was 49% and 16%, respectively. Four and
25 death events occurred during the early and late follow-up, respectively. The
incidence of morbidity and mortality were not related to ASA, ACE or Charlson
scores. Preoperative malnutrition, renal insufficiency, higher need of
perioperative blood transfusions, and prolonged ileus were identified as risk
factors of postoperative morbidity. Late complications seemed related to low
weight.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered a model of accelerated aging. More
specifically, CKD leads to reduced physical functioning and increased frailty,
increased vascular dysfunction, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness,
high levels of systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased 
cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence suggests that the cognitive impairment 
associated with CKD may be related to cerebral small vessel disease and overall
impairment in white matter integrity. The triad of poor physical function,
vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment places patients living with CKD at
an increased risk for loss of independence, poor health-related quality of life, 
morbidity, and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the available 
evidence of cerebrovascular-renal axis and its interconnection with early and
accelerated cognitive impairment in patients with CKD and the plausible role of
exercise as a therapeutic modality. Understanding the cerebrovascular-renal axis 
pathophysiological link and its interconnection with physical function is
important for clinicians in order to minimize the risk of loss of independence
and improve quality of life in patients with CKD.

BACKGROUND: "Frailty" is a marker of physiological decline of multiple organ
systems, and the frailty index identifies patients who are more susceptible to
postoperative complications. The purpose of this study is to validate the
modified frailty index (MFI) as a predictor of postoperative complications,
reoperations, and readmissions in patients who underwent primary total knee
arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program database from 2005 to 2014 was queried by the Current Procedural
Terminology code for primary TKA (27447). A previously described MFI was used to 
summate 11 variables in 5 organ systems. Bivariate analysis was performed for
postoperative complications. A multiple logistic regression model was used to
determine the relationship between MFI, American Society of Anesthesiologists
score, and 30-day reoperation, controlling for age, gender, and body mass index.
RESULTS: A total of 90,260 patients underwent primary TKA during the study
period. As MFI score increased, 30-day mortality significantly increased (P <
.001). In addition, significantly higher rates of postoperative complications
(all P < .001) were observed with increasing MFI: infection, wound, cardiac,
pulmonary, and renal complications; and any occurrence. More frail patients also 
had increasing odds of adverse hospital discharge disposition, reoperation, and
readmission (all P < .001). Length of hospital stay increased from 3.10 to 5.16
days (P < .001), while length of intensive care unit stay increased from 3.47 to 
5.07 days (P < .001) between MFI score 0 and ≥0.36. MFI predicts 30-day
reoperation with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.32 (95% confidence interval,
1.36-8.11; P < .001). Comparatively, MFI was a stronger predictor of reoperation 
compared with American Society of Anesthesiologists score and age with adjustment
for gender and body mass index.
CONCLUSION: Utilization of the MFI is a valid method in predicting postoperative 
complications, reoperations, and readmissions in patients undergoing primary TKA 
and can provide an effective and robust risk assessment tool to appropriately
counsel patients and aid in preoperative optimization.

Patients with chronic kidney disease experience substantial loss of muscle mass, 
weakness, and poor physical performance. As kidney disease progresses, skeletal
muscle dysfunction forms a common pathway for mobility limitation, loss of
functional independence, and vulnerability to disease complications. Screening
for those at high risk for mobility disability by self-reported and objective
measures of function is an essential first step in developing an
interdisciplinary approach to treatment that includes rehabilitative therapies
and counseling on physical activity. Exercise has beneficial effects on systemic 
inflammation, muscle, and physical performance in chronic kidney disease. Kidney 
health providers need to identify patient and care delivery barriers to exercise 
in order to effectively counsel patients on physical activity. A thorough medical
evaluation and assessment of baseline function using self-reported and objective 
function assessment is essential to guide an effective individualized exercise
prescription to prevent function decline in persons with kidney disease. This
review focuses on the impact of kidney disease on skeletal muscle dysfunction in 
the context of the disablement process and reviews screening and treatment
strategies that kidney health professionals can use in clinical practice to
prevent functional decline and disability.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of complications in
elderly patients with a hip fracture following integrated orthogeriatric
treatment. To discover factors that might be adjusted, in order to improve
outcome in those patients, we examined the association between baseline patient
characteristics and a complicated course.
METHODS: We included patients aged 70 years and older with a hip fracture, who
were treated at the Centre for Geriatric Traumatology (CvGT) at Ziekenhuisgroep
Twente (ZGT) Almelo, the Netherlands between April 2011 and October 2013. Data
registration was carried out using the clinical pathways of the CvGT database.
Based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, patients were
divided into high-risk (HR, ASA 3 ≥, n = 341) and low-risk (LR, ASA 1-2, n = 111)
groups and compared on their recovery. Multivariate logistic regression was used 
to identify risk factors for a complicated course.
RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated that 49.6% (n = 224) of the patients
experienced a complicated course with an in-hospital mortality rate of 3.8%
(n = 17). In 57.5% (n = 196) of the HR patients, a complicated course was seen
compared to 25.2% (n = 28) of the LR patients. The most common complications in
both groups were the occurrence of delirium (HR 25.8% vs. LR 8.1%, p ≤ 0.001),
anemia (HR 19.4% vs. LR 6.3%, p = 0.001), catheter-associated urinary tract
infections (CAUTIs) (HR 10.6% vs. LR 7.2%, p = 0.301) and pneumonia (HR 10.9% vs.
LR 5.4%, p = 0.089). Independent risk factors for a complicated course were
increasing age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p = 0.023), delirium risk VMS Frailty 
score (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.04-2.37, p = 0.031) and ASA score ≥3 (OR 3.62, 95% CI
2.22-5.91, p ≤ 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: After integrated orthogeriatric treatment, a complicated course was 
seen in 49.6% of the patients with a hip fracture. The in-hospital mortality rate
was 3.8%. Important risk factors for a complicated course were increasing age,
poor medical condition and delirium risk VMS Frailty score. Awareness of risk
factors that affect the course during admission can be useful in optimizing care 
and outcomes. In the search for possible areas for improvement in care, targeted 
preventive measures to mitigate delirium, and healthcare-associated infections
(HAIs), such as CAUTIs and pneumonia are important.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review sarcopenia in chronic kidney
disease (CKD). We aim to present how definitions of sarcopenia from the general
population may pertain to those with CKD, its assessment by clinicians and
emerging therapies for sarcopenia in CKD. For this review, we limit our
description and recommendations to patients with CKD who are not on dialysis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Poorer parameters of lean mass, strength and physical function
are associated with worsening patient-centered outcomes such as limiting
mobility, falls and mortality in CKD; however, the magnitude of these
associations are different in those with and without CKD. Sarcopenia in CKD is a 
balance between skeletal muscle regeneration and catabolism, which are both
altered in the uremic environment. Multiple pathways are involved in these
derangements, which are briefly reviewed. Differences between commonly used terms
cachexia, frailty, protein-energy wasting, dynapenia and sarcopenia are
described. Therapeutic options in predialysis CKD are not well studied;
therefore, we review exercise options and emerging pharmacological therapies.
SUMMARY: Sarcopenia, now with its own International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision (ICD-10) code, is of importance clinically and should be accounted 
for in research studies in patients with CKD. Multiple therapies for sarcopenia
are in development and will hopefully be available for our patients in the
future.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older kidney transplant recipients are susceptible to 
cognitive impairment, frailty, comorbidities, immunosuppression-related
complications, and chronic graft failure, however, there has been limited focus
on their concerns and expectations related to transplantation. This study aims to
describe the perspectives of older kidney transplant recipients about their
experience of kidney transplantation, self-management, and treatment goals to
inform strategies and interventions that address their specific needs.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Face-to-face semistructured
interviews were conducted with 30 kidney transplant recipients aged 65-80 years
from five renal units in Australia. Transcripts were analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: Six themes were identified: restoring vitality of youth (with subthemes 
of revived mindset for resilience, embracing enjoyment in life, drive for
self-actualization); persisting through prolonged recovery (yielding to aging,
accepting functional limitations, pushing the limit, enduring treatment
responsibilities); imposing sicknesses (combatting devastating comorbidities,
painful restrictions, emerging disillusionment, anxieties about accumulating side
effects, consuming treatment burden); prioritizing graft survival (privileged
with a miracle, negotiating risks for longevity, enacting a moral duty,
preserving the last opportunity); confronting health deterioration (vulnerability
and helplessness, narrowing focus to immediate concerns, uncertainty of
survival); and value of existence (purpose through autonomy, refusing the burden 
of futile treatment, staying alive by all means).
CONCLUSIONS: Older kidney transplant recipients felt able to enjoy life and
strived to live at their newly re-established potential and capability, which
motivated them to protect their graft. However, some felt constrained by slow
recuperation and overwhelmed by unexpected comorbidities, medication-related side
effects, and health decline. Our findings suggest the need to prepare and support
older recipients for self-management responsibilities, clarify their expectations
of post-transplant risks and outcomes, and provide assistance through prolonged
recovery after kidney transplantation.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the significant clinical
predictors of incident heart failure (HF) and its prognostic effect on long-term 
outcomes among community-based patients with established atrial
fibrillation (AF).
BACKGROUND: AF is associated with an increased risk of HF. However, in this
population, little focus is placed on risk stratification for and the prevention 
of HF.
METHODS: Patients with AF but without HF at baseline enrolled in the ORBIT-AF
(Outcomes Registry for Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation) registry were
included. Separate multivariable-adjusted Cox frailty regression models were used
to identify significant predictors of HF incidence and determine the associated
risk of adverse clinical events.
RESULTS: The study included 6,545 participants with AF from 173 participating
sites. Incident HF developed in 236 participants (3.6%) over the 2-year follow-up
period; ejection fraction was preserved (>40%) in 64%, reduced (≤40%) in 13.5%,
and missing in 22.5%. In multivariable analysis, traditional HF risk factors
(age, coronary artery disease, renal dysfunction, and valvular disease), presence
of permanent AF (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.60 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18 to
2.16]; reference group: paroxysmal AF), and elevated baseline heart rate (HR:
1.07 [95% CI: 1.02 to 1.13] per 5 beats/min higher heart rate) were independently
associated with incident HF risk. Incident HF among patients with AF was
independently associated with higher risk of mortality, all-cause
hospitalization, and bleeding events.
CONCLUSIONS: Incident HF among patients with AF is common, is more likely to be
HF with preserved ejection fraction, and is associated with poor long-term
outcomes. Traditional HF risk factors, AF type, and baseline heart rate are
independent clinical predictors of incident HF.

It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased
postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease 
who underwent lower extremity surgical revascularization; however, outcomes after
peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) are less well established. This study
sought to determine the impact of CKD on adverse outcomes in patients with
peripheral artery disease who underwent PVI. Using data from the Veteran Affairs 
Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System Program, we identified a
cohort of 755 patients who underwent lower extremity PVI from June 2005 to August
2010 at 33 sites. The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to
dialysis, myocardial infarction, limb amputation, and stroke. Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard frailty models assessed the
association between CKD and adverse outcomes. Of the patients who underwent lower
extremity PVI, 201 patients (27%) had CKD. The presence of CKD was associated
with decreased survival (5-year survival probability of CKD compared with
non-CKD: 49.9% [41.6% to 59.9%] vs 80.1% [76.2% to 84.1]), which persisted after 
risk adjustment (HR 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.19). In addition,
there was a significant association between CKD and progression to dialysis (HR
6.62; 95% confidence interval 2.25 to 19.43). In contrast, there was no
association between CKD and re-hospitalization for myocardial infarction, limb
amputation, or stroke. In conclusion, CKD is present in 1 of 4 patients who
underwent PVI and is associated with increased risk of mortality and progression 
to dialysis.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older
adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive
impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of
life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in
increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in
hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients 
with pre-dialysis CKD.
METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385
patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated 
tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive
frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial.
Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of ≤24. We determined the
prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages 
G4-G5, not on dialysis.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5
had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control
group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most
pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function 
(p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of
stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment
in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects
of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of
cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes
deserves further study.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney
function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in
community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level,
and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0
(normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Frailty status
was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle
weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of
having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were more frail
(odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition,
individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or
hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of
frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. 
Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty 
in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI
1.13-14.1) CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a
higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Geriatr

Dysregulation of skeletal remodeling is a component of renal osteodystrophy.
Previously, we showed that activin receptor signaling is differentially affected 
in various tissues in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether a ligand
trap for the activin receptor type 2A (RAP-011) is an effective treatment of the 
osteodystrophy of the CKD-mineral bone disorder. With a 70% reduction in the
glomerular filtration rate, CKD was induced at 14 weeks of age in the ldlr-/-
high fat-fed mouse model of atherosclerotic vascular calcification and diabetes. 
Twenty mice with CKD, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated
activin A were treated with RAP-011, wherease 19 mice were given vehicle twice
weekly from week 22 until the mice were killed at 28 weeks of age. The animals
were then evaluated by skeletal histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography,
mechanical strength testing, and ex vivo bone cell culture. Results in the CKD
groups were compared with those of the 16 sham-operated ldlr-/- high fat-fed
mice. Sham-operated mice had low-turnover osteodystrophy and skeletal frailty.
CKD stimulated bone remodeling with significant increases in osteoclast and
osteoblast numbers and bone resorption. Compared with mice with CKD
and sham-operated mice, RAP-011 treatment eliminated the CKD-induced increase in 
these histomorphometric parameters and increased trabecular bone fraction.
RAP-011 significantly increased cortical bone area and thickness. Activin
A-enhanced osteoclastogenesis was mediated through p-Smad2 association with c-fos
and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Thus, an
ActRIIA ligand trap reversed CKD-stimulated bone remodeling, likely through
inhibition of activin-A induced osteoclastogenesis.

INTRODUCTION: Failure-to-rescue (FTR) (defined as death from a major
complication) is considered as an index of hospital quality in trauma patients.
However, the role of frailty in FTR events remains unclear. We hypothesized that 
FTR rate is higher in elderly frail trauma patients.
METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of all elderly (age ≥ 65 years) 
trauma patients presenting at our level one trauma center. Patient's frailty
status was calculated utilizing the Trauma Specific Frailty Index (TSFI) within
24 hours of admission. Patients were stratified into non-frail, pre-frail, and
frail. FTR was defined as death from a major complication (respiratory,
infectious, cardiac, and renal). Binary logistic regression analysis was
performed after adjusting for age, gender, injury severity (ISS), and vital
parameters to assess the relationship between frailty status and FTR.
RESULTS: A total of 368 elderly trauma patients were evaluated of which 25% (n = 
93) were non-frail, 38% (n = 139) pre-frail, and 37% (n = 136) frail. Overall,
30% of the patients developed in-hospital complications; of them, mortality
occurred in 26% of the patients (FTR group). In the FTR group, 69% of the
patients were frail compared to 17% pre-frail and 14% non-frail (p = 0.002). On
multivariate regression analysis for predictors of FTR, frail status was an
independent predictor of FTR (OR [95% CI] = 2.67 [1.37-5.20]; p = 0.004). On
sensitivity analysis, positive predictive value of TSFI for FTR was 69% and
negative predictive value for FTR was 67%.
CONCLUSION: In elderly trauma patients, the presence of frailty increased the
odds of FTR almost threefold as compared to non-frail. Although FTR has been
considered as an indicator of health care quality, the findings of this study
suggest that frailty status independently contributes to FTR. This needs to be
considered in the future development of quality metrics, particularly in the case
of geriatric trauma patients.

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its
impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
is less defined.
METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 
trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three
groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR
≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were
analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors
of 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the
PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767
(30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 
(12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted
Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with
severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher
prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of
death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate
and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% 
in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild
RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus
none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other
significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass
index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction,
oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male
sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year
mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is
required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a perioperative metastatic spinal
tumor frailty index (MSTFI) that could predict morbidity, mortality, and length
of stay.
METHODS: A large inpatient hospitalization database was searched from 2002 to
2011 to identify 4583 patients with spinal metastasis from breast (21.1%), lung
(34.1%), thyroid (3.8%), renal (19.9%), and prostate (21.1%) cancer who underwent
surgery. A multiple logistic regression model identified 9 independent parameters
that were used to construct the MSTFI: anemia, chronic lung disease,
coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary circulation disorders, renal
failure, malnutrition, emergent/urgent admission, and anterior/combined surgical 
approach. Patients with 0 points were categorized as "not frail," 1 as "mildly
frail," 2 as "moderately frail," and ≥3 as "severely frail."
RESULTS: The overall perioperative complication rate was 19.3% and in-patient
mortality was 3.0%. Compared with patients with no frailty, patients with
moderate frailty (odds ratio [OR] 5.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]
2.44-10.86), and severe frailty (OR 5.74; 95% CI 2.69-12.24) had significantly
increased odds of inpatient mortality (all P < 0.001). Similarly, patients with
mild frailty (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.33-2.66), moderate frailty (OR 3.83; 95% CI
2.71-5.41), and severe frailty (OR 6.97; 95% CI 4.98-9.74) had significantly
increased odds of developing a major in-hospital complication (all P < 0.001).
Length of stay also increased significantly by MSTFI (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In surgically treated patients with spinal metastasis, certain
perioperative parameters may significantly predict the risk of major in-hospital 
complications and mortality.

Dialysis care is often associated with poor outcomes including low quality of
life (QOL). To improve patient-reported outcomes, incorporation of the patient's 
needs and perspective into the medical care they receive is essential. This
article provides a framework to help clinicians integrate symptom assessment and 
other measures such as QOL and frailty scores into a clinical approach to the
contemporary supportive care of patients with advanced CKD. This approach
involves (1) defining our understanding of kidney supportive care,
patient-centered dialysis, and palliative dialysis; (2) understanding and
recognizing common symptoms associated with advanced CKD; (3) discussing the
concepts of physical function, frailty, and QOL and their role in CKD; and (4)
identifying the structural and process barriers that may arise when
patient-centered dialysis is being introduced into clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation offers improved survival and quality of life
to an increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease.
However, elderly kidney transplant recipients may face unique challenges due to a
higher burden of comorbidity, greater cumulative risk of
immunosuppression-related complications and increasing frailty. We aimed to
describe the perspectives of elderly kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to April 2015. Qualitative studies
were eligible if they reported views from elderly kidney transplant recipients
(≥60 years). Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the findings.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving >116 recipients were included. We
identified seven themes. 'Regaining strength and vitality' meant valuing the
physical and psychosocial improvements in daily functioning and life
participation. 'Extending life' was the willingness to accept any organ,
including extended criteria kidneys, to prolong survival. 'Debt of gratitude'
entailed conscious appreciation toward their donor while knowing they were unable
to repay their sacrifice. 'Moral responsibility to maintain health' motivated
adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations out of an ethical duty to
protect their gift for graft survival. 'Unabating and worsening forgetfulness'
hindered self-management. 'Disillusionment with side effects and complications'
reflected disappointment and exasperation with the unintended consequences of
medications. 'Finality of treatment option' was an acute awareness that the
current transplant may be their last.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation was perceived to slow and even reverse the
experience of aging among elderly recipients, especially compared with dialysis. 
However, some were frustrated over persistent limitations after transplant,
struggled with the burden of medication side effects and worried about a possible
return to dialysis if the transplant failed. Clarifying patient expectations of
transplantation, providing support to alleviate the debilitating impacts of
immunosuppression and addressing fears about deteriorating health and graft
failure may improve satisfaction and outcomes in elderly kidney transplant
recipients.

BACKGROUND: Patient-centered quality outcomes such as disposition after surgery
are increasingly being scrutinized. Preoperative factors predictive of nonhome
discharge (DC) may identify at-risk patients for targeted interventions. This
study examines the association among preoperative risk factors, frailty, and
nonhome DC after elective vascular surgery procedures in patients living at home.
METHODS: The 2011-2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was
queried to identify all home-dwelling patients who underwent elective vascular
procedures (endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair, suprainguinal and
infrainguinal bypasses, peripheral endovascular interventions, carotid
endarterectomy, and stent). Preoperative frailty was measured using the modified 
frailty index (mFI; derived from Canadian Study of Health and Aging). Univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the
association of frailty and nonhome DC.
RESULTS: Of 15,843 home-dwelling patients, 1,177 patients (7.4%) did not return
home postoperatively. Frailty (mFI > 0.25) conferred a significantly increased
2-fold risk of nonhome DC disposition for each procedure type. Frailty, female
gender, open procedures, increasing age, end-stage renal disease, and occurrence 
of any postoperative complication were associated with increased risk of nonhome 
DC. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, frailty increased the odds of
nonhome DC by 60% (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4-1.8) after
adjusting for other covariates. In the presence of complications, the risk of
nonhome DC was 27.5% in frail versus 16.5% in nonfrail patients (P < 0.001). In
the absence of complications, although absolute risk was lower, frail patients
were nearly twice as likely to not return home (frail 5.5% vs. nonfrail 2.75%,
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail home-dwelling patients undergoing elective vascular procedures
are at high risk of not returning home after surgery. Preoperative frailty
assessment appears to hold potential for counseling regarding postsurgery
disposition and DC planning.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

PURPOSE: Our objective was to determine the impact of preoperative frailty, as
measured by validated Risk Analysis Index (RAI), on the occurrence of
postoperative complications after urologic surgeries in a national database
comprised of diverse practice groups and cases.
STUDY DESIGN: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database 
was queried from 2005 to 2011 for a list of abdominal, vaginal, transurethral and
scrotal urological surgeries using Current Procedural Terminology codes. The
study population was subdivided into two groups based on the nature of procedures
performed: complex procedures (inpatient) and simple procedures (outpatient).
Risk Analysis Index score was calculated using preoperative NSQIP variables to
determine preoperative frailty. Major postoperative morbidities (pulmonary,
cardiovascular, renal and infectious), mortality, return to operating room,
discharge destination and readmission to the hospital were examined.
RESULTS: The study identified 42,715 patients who underwent urological
procedures, 25,693 complex and 17,022 simple procedures. Mean RAI score (range)
was 7.75 (0-53). The majority of patients scored low on the RAI (90.57 % with
RAI < 10). As the RAI score increased, there was a significant increase in
postoperative complication and mortality rate (both p < 0.0001). Similarly, the
rate of return to operating room and hospital readmission rate increased as RAI
increased (both p < 0.0001). Additionally, rate of discharge to home decreased.
Interestingly, mortality rate in patients with high RAI did not differ comparing 
simple to complex procedures (p = 0.90), whereas complications were significantly
greater in the complex operation (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Increase in frailty, as measured by RAI score, is associated with
increased postoperative complications and mortality. RAI may allow for rapid
identification and counseling of patients who are at high risk of adverse
perioperative outcomes.

Skeletal muscle mass and muscle function are negatively affected by a variety of 
conditions inherent to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to dialysis treatment.
Skeletal muscle mass and function serve as indicators of the nutritional and
clinical state of CKD patients, and low values or derangements over time are
strong predictors of poor patient outcomes. However, muscle size and function can
be affected by different factors, may decline at different rates, and may have
different patient implications. Therefore, operational definitions of frailty and
sarcopenia have emerged to encompass these 2 dimensions of muscle health, i.e.,
size and functionality. The aim of this review is to appraise available methods
for assessment of muscle mass and functionality, with an emphasis on their
accuracy in the setting of CKD patients. We then discuss the selection of
reference cutoffs for defining conditions of muscle wasting and dysfunction.
Finally, we review definitions applied in studies addressing sarcopenia and
frailty in CKD patients and discuss their applicability for diagnosis and
monitoring.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with
postoperative delirium in patients undergoing urological surgery.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated pre- and postoperative risk factors for
postoperative delirium in consecutive 215 patients who received urological
surgery between August 2013 and November 2014. Preoperative factors included
patient demographics, comorbidities, and frailty assessment. Frailty was measured
by handgrip strength, fatigue scale of depression, fall risk assessment, and gait
speed (the timed Get-up and Go test). Postoperative factors included types of
anesthesia, surgical procedure, renal function and serum albumin decline, blood
loss, surgery time, highest body temperature, and complications. Uni- and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess pre- and
postoperative predictors for the development of postoperative delirium.
RESULTS: Median age of this cohort was 67 years. Ten patients (4.7%) experienced 
postoperative delirium. These patients were significantly older, had weak
handgrip strength, a higher fall risk assessment score, slow gait speed, and
greater renal function decline compared with patients without delirium.
Multivariate analysis revealed slow gait speed (>13.0 s) and rapid renal function
decline (>30%) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow gait speed and rapid renal function decline after urological
surgery are significant factors for postoperative delirium. These data will be
helpful for perioperative patient management. This study was registered as a
clinical trial: UMIN: R000018809.

BACKGROUND: Although influence of technical complications in association to
hospital length of stay has been studied extensively in esophageal resection,
nontechnical factors responsible for prolonged length of stay have not been
reported. Using the NSQIP dataset, we hypothesized that we would be able to
identify factors associated with prolonged length of stay after esophagectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data from 2005 to
2012 were reviewed for CPT codes for esophagectomy. Outlier status for length of 
stay was defined as >75th percentile. Logistic regression was used to predict
outlier status and linear regression to discern factors contributing to longer
lengths of stay.
RESULTS: A total of 3,538 cases were reviewed. The 75th percentile for length of 
stay was 17 days. Preoperative predictors of hospital stay outliers include
emergency surgery and frailty index (odds ratios = 3.7 and 3.6; p < 0.001). Deep 
organ space infection and progressive renal insufficiency had the highest
likelihood of prolonged length of stay (odds ratios = 5.2 and 5.1; p < 0.001).
Failure to wean off of ventilator in 48 hours, urinary tract infection, and
pneumonia were associated with length of stay outlier (odds ratios = 3.7, 2.7,
and 2.7; all p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary tract infection and pneumonia after esophagectomy are
associated with longer hospital stays. Although meticulous surgical technique
remains paramount, our study demonstrates that postoperative nontechnical
complications factor into prolonged hospital stays. Focus on such factors can
lead to reductions in hospital stays.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With aging of the general population, patients who
enter dialysis therapy will more frequently have geriatric impairments and a
considerable comorbidity burden. The most vulnerable among these patients might
benefit from conservative therapy. Whether assessment of geriatric impairments
would contribute to the decision-making process of dialysis initiation is
unknown.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A systematic Medline and Embase
search was performed on December 1, 2015 to identify studies assessing the
association between risk of mortality or hospitalization and one or more
geriatric impairments at the start of dialysis therapy, including impairment of
cognitive function, mood, performance status or (instrumental) activities of
daily living, mobility (including falls), social environment, or nutritional
status.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were identified that assessed one or more geriatric
impairments with respect to prognosis. The quality of most studies was moderate. 
Only seven studies carried out an analysis of elderly patients (≥70 years old).
Malnutrition and frailty were systematically assessed, and their relation with
mortality was clear. In addition, cognitive impairment and functional outcomes at
the initiation of dialysis were related to an increased mortality in most
studies. However, not all studies applied systematic assessment tools, thereby
potentially missing relevant impairment. None of the studies applied a geriatric 
assessment across multiple domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric impairment across multiple domains at dialysis initiation 
is related to poor outcome. However, information in the elderly is sparse, and a 
systematic approach of multiple domains with respect to poor outcome has not been
performed. Because a geriatric assessment has proved useful in predicting outcome
in other medical fields, its potential role in the ESRD population should be the 
subject of future research.

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with
destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial
cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However,
surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis
rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on
hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal
kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree
decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior
instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to
adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical 
motion.

Background. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a high symptom
burden, among which fatigue is highly prevalent. Many fatigue-assessing
instruments exist, but comparisons among instruments in this patient population
have yet to be investigated. Methods. ESRD patients under chronic hemodialysis
were prospectively enrolled and seven types of fatigue instruments were
administered: Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Lee Fatigue
Scale (LFS), Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and
Short-Form 36-Vitality (SF36-V). Using these instruments, we investigated the
correlation between fatigue severity and clinical/biochemical parameters,
including demographic/comorbidity profile, dialysis-related complications, and
frailty severity. We used regression analysis with serum albumin and frailty
severity as the dependent variables to investigate the independent correlations. 
Results. A total of 46 ESRD patients were enrolled (average age of 67 ± 11.6
years), and 50% of them had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results from the seven
tested instruments showed high correlation with each other. We found that the
fatigue severity by FACIT-F was significantly associated with age (p = 0.03),
serum albumin (p = 0.003) and creatinine (p = 0.02) levels, while SF36-V scores
were also significantly associated with age (p = 0.02) and serum creatinine
levels (p = 0.04). However, the fatigue severity measured by the FSS, FSI, FQ,
BFI, and LFS did not exhibit these associations. Moreover, regression analysis
showed that only FACIT-F scores were independently associated with serum albumin 
levels and frailty severity in ESRD patients. Conclusion. Among the seven
fatigue-assessing instruments, only the FACIT-F yielded results that demonstrated
significant and independent associations with important outcome-related features 
in ESRD patients.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of sarcopenia as a frailty assessment tool for
patients with aortic stenosis undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR)
or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: The study cohort comprised 295 patients who underwent either SAVR (n =
156) or TAVR (n = 139). The mean preoperative Society of Thoracic Surgeons
mortality risk score was 4.7%. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were
used to calculate gender-standardized total psoas area (TPA), as a validated
measure of sarcopenia.
RESULTS: For the entire cohort, independent predictors of a composite measure of 
30-day death, stroke, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, and deep wound
infection included preoperative STS major morbidity and mortality risk score
(odds ratio [OR], 91.1; P = .02) and TPA (OR, 0.5; P = .024). Two-year survival
was 85.7% in patients with sarcopenia, compared with 93.8% in patients without
sarcopenia (P = .02). Independent predictors of late survival included TPA
(hazard ratio, 0.47; P = .02). Male sex (OR, 0.52; P = .04) and TPA (OR, 0.6; P =
.001) were predictive of high resource utilization. A separate analysis by
treatment group found that TPA predicted high resource utilization after SAVR
(OR, 0.4; P < .001), but not after TAVR (P = .66).
CONCLUSIONS: CT scan-derived measurement of TPA as an objective frailty
assessment tool predicts early morbidity and mortality, high resource
utilization, and late survival after treatment for aortic stenosis. The
correlation observed between sarcopenia and resource utilization after SAVR
versus TAVR suggests that this simple and reproducible risk assessment tool also 
may help identify those patients who will derive optimal benefit from
catheter-based therapy.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

[Hyponatremia in the elderly: its role in frailty].

[Article in French]

Hanotier P.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in elderly patients. The
incidence is about 7% in elderly healthy people but can exceed 40% in
hospitalized patients. Considering all its aetiologies hyponatremia is associated
with increased mortality and appears as a factor of poor prognosis. Alteration in
the regulation of water homeostasis in the elderly result from multiple
consequence of aging: change in body composition, alteration in renal function
and hormonal changes. The high frequency of nutritional problems, particularly
protein malnutrition predisposes the elderly to the development of hyponatremia. 
Although diuretics especially thiazides are implicated as a frequent cause of
hyponatremia on geriatric medicine, normovolemic hyponatremia and more
particularly the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis is the most common cause.
The aetiology of this syndrome can be determined in only approximately half of
the cases. Cancers and medications, principally psychotropic agents commonly
prescribed in geriatrics are the most frequent aetiologies. Hyponatremia could be
a factor of frailty in geriatrics. Mild to moderate hyponatremia is generally
considered asymptomatic but recent studies reported that asymptomatic
hyponatremia contributes to neurological troubles like cognitive disorders,
posture and gait impairments. Hyponatremia could be an independent risk factor of
falls and could be associated with the development of osteoporosis. This review
of the literature emphasizes the importance of screening and a systematic
management of hyponatremia in the elderly people, even in the minor forms and
those considered as asymptomatic.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acute pancreatitis (AP) in elderly may have an aggressive
course due to co-morbidity high rate and severe presentation. We retrospectively 
evaluated AP severity and its underlying factors in a group of elderly patients
compared with an adult population sample.
METHODS: Forty-two elderly patients (65-102years) and 48 controls (19-64years)
admitted at our Unit for biliary or alcoholic AP were retrospectively enrolled.
AP severity was evaluated by the Atlanta classification and Ransom score.
Laboratory investigations and demographic data were collected. Comparison between
the two groups was performed by t-test, ANOVA or Fisher's exact test. A
multinomial logistic regression was used to determine factors affecting AP
severity.
RESULTS: Elderly patients showed more severe Atlanta (1.81±0.75 vs 1.29±0.46;
p=0.007) and higher Ransom (2.52±1.57 vs 0.75±0.73; p<0.0001) scores. No death
was observed. Elderly patients consumed more drugs than controls, had higher
rates of cardiovascular, pulmonary and renal co-morbidity, showed higher
creatinine (1.09±0.41 vs 0.81±0.18; p=0.004) and lower calcium levels (8.43±0.48 
vs 8.88±0.44; p=0.002). We observed only one case of fluid necrosis in an old
patient. Non-necrotic fluid collections were more common in the elderly (40.5% vs
12.5%; p=0.003). At multivariate analysis, AP severity was influenced by white
blood cell-count (WBC: OR=1.94; p=0.048), aspartate-transaminase-levels (AST:
OR=1.97; p=0.02), serum lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH: OR=1.07; p=0.047) and Ransom 
score (OR=70.4; p=0.036) in elderly, while only Ransom score correlated in
controls (OR=66.04; p<0.001). The etiology (biliary/alcoholic) did not influence 
the severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients usually undergo a severe AP course, but without
increase of mortality. High WBC, LDH, AST and Ransom score at the onset may
predict AP severity.

Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among
the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample
evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the
best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to
remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this
population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive
impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to
transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after
transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and
affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can
increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death
with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney
allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft
utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer
wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to
kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and
propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

Consequences of aging are gaining clinical relevance. In transplantation, aging
and immunosenescence impact treatment and outcomes. The impact of aging, however,
will critically depend on distinguishing healthy, chronological aging from
biological aging that may result into frailty. Approximately 15% of individuals
older than 65 years are frail, and it is expected that this condition will gain
more clinical relevance with an expected increase to greater than 20% over the
next 5 years. Clearly, frailty impacts various general aspects of health care and
organ transplantation in particular including patient selection, waitlist
management and treatment after transplantation. In general, frailty has been
characterized by a compromised physiological reserve and an augmented
vulnerability. In comparison to healthy aging, inflammatory markers and cytokines
are increased in frail older adults. Thus, modifications of the immune response, 
in addition to physical limitations and changes of metabolism, are likely to
impact outcomes after transplantation. Here, we provide a risk assessment of
frailty at the time of transplant evaluation and review effects on outcomes and
recovery after transplantation. Moreover, we summarize our current understanding 
of the pathophysiology of frailty and consequences on immune responses and
metabolism.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility and safety of a
balloon-expandable, re-collapsible sheath for TAVR patients, including those with
small iliofemoral access (≤5.0 mm).
BACKGROUND: The recommended iliofemoral diameter for the CoreValve TAVR system is
≥6.0 mm, but the lowest limit has not been determined.
METHODS: Of 322 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR from 1/2014 to 8/2015 at 
two institutions, 64 underwent transfemoral CoreValve implantation, using an
11/19-French balloon-expandable, re-collapsible sheath, which has a 4.45 mm outer
diameter (OD) on arterial entry, expands to 7.67 mm, then re-collapses upon
removal. Valve sizing and vascular access were determined by computed tomography,
and outcomes were assessed using the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2
(VARC-2) definitions.
RESULTS: Thirteen of 64 patients had a minimal iliofemoral artery luminal
diameter (MLD) of ≤5.0 mm (mean 4.38+/-0.59 mm, range 3.1-5.0 mm), with vessel
calcification ≤90° to 360° and tortuosity <45° to >90°. At the MLD point, the
sheath-to-artery ratios, based on the fully expanded 7.67 mm OD, ranged
1.53-2.47, higher than previously reported ratios that risk vascular
complications. Major comorbidities included chronic renal failure, severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, extreme thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis, prior cardiac
surgery, poor ventricular function, and frailty. All 64 patients had TAVR with IV
sedation and local anesthesia, with 0% sheath malfunction, 0% vascular
complications, and 0% bleeding in-hospital and at 30 days per VARC-2 definitions.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR using a balloon-expandable, re-collapsible sheath is safe,
including in small iliofemoral access ≤5.0 mm, thus considerably expanding the
population suitable for transfemoral approach. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Intermediate- or low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis were excluded from
earlier transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) clinical trials; however, 
they are already being treated by TAVI despite a lack of data regarding the
safety and efficacy in these patients. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy
of TAVI in patients at intermediate or low risk. Patients undergoing TAVI during 
2008 to 2014 were included into a shared database (n = 1,327). Procedural
outcomes were adjudicated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 2
definitions. Patients were stratified according to their Society of Thoracic
Surgeons (STS) score into 3 groups: high (STS ≥8, n = 223, 17%), intermediate
(STS 4 to 8; n = 496, 38%), or low risk (STS <4; n = 576, 45%). Low-risk patients
were significantly younger and more likely to be men compared to intermediate-
and high-risk patients. Baseline characteristics differed significantly between
the groups with a gradual increase in the rates of previous bypass surgery,
stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, lung disease, and frailty
scores, from low to high risk groups. Compared with intermediate- and high-risk
patients, low-risk patients were more likely to undergo TAVI through the
transfemoral route (81% vs 88% vs 95%, p <0.001) and under conscious sedation
(69% vs 72% vs 81%, <0.001). There were no significant differences in the rates
of procedural complications apart from acute kidney injury (19% vs 17% vs 13%, p 
= 0.03) and stroke rates (4.5% vs 2% vs 2.3%, p = 0.1). Short- and long-term
mortality rates were significantly higher for intermediate- (hazard ratio [HR]
1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 2.9) and high-risk patients (HR 4.1, 95%
CI 2.7 to 6.4) than low-risk patients also after multivariate adjustment (HR 1.6,
95% CI 1 to 2.6 and HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 4.5, respectively; all p <0.05). In
conclusion, TAVI for intermediate- and low-risk patients is safe and associated
with improved outcome compared with high-risk patients.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) in the elderly is a complex condition. It
has a direct impact on the underuse of antithrombotic therapy reported in this
population.
DISCUSSION: All patients aged ≥75 years with AF have an individual yearly risk of
stroke >4 %. However, the risk of hemorrhage is also increased. Moreover, in this
population it is common the presence of other comorbidities, cognitive disorders,
risk of falls and polymedication. This may lead to an underuse of anticoagulant
therapy. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are at least as effective as
conventional therapy, but with lesser risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The
simplification of treatment with these drugs may be an advantage in patients with
cognitive impairment. The great majority of elderly patients with AF should
receive anticoagulant therapy, unless an unequivocal contraindication. DOACs may 
be the drugs of choice in many elderly patients with AF. In this manuscript, the 
available evidence about the management of anticoagulation in elderly patients
with AF is reviewed. In addition, specific practical recommendations about
different controversial issues (i.e. patients with anemia, thrombocytopenia, risk
of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal dysfunction, cognitive impairment, risk of
falls, polymedication, frailty, etc.) are provided.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

The prevalence of anemia in old patients is 20%. Anemia is mostly multifactorial 
associated with multiple comorbidities that are frequently observed in people of 
65 years or older. Chronic renal failure, inflammatory diseases, nutrient
deficiencies and especially iron deficiency are the most associated conditions
with anemia. Anemia represents a prognosis marker of general health in old
people. Thus anemia is associated with higher rates of morbidities (such as
unplanned hospitalizations) and greatest mortality. Therefore anemia could be
considered either as a consequence of chronic diseases or a prognosis marker of
their severity. The prognosis of chronic cardiac failure is for example worst in 
anemic patients. Finally anemia is listed as a component of the frailty.

AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to 
complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and
functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total
number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and
assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD
0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified
Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P =
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good
construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the
potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for
patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

BACKGROUND: Older adults are at increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), its
thromboembolic complications, and bleeding. A significant percentage of
octogenarians do not receive anticoagulation therapy. The objective of this study
was to investigate the effect of thromboembolic risk, bleeding risk, and frailty 
on the anticoagulation status of octogenarians hospitalized with AF.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 682 hospitalized patients aged 
80 years and older with AF or atrial flutter in Montreal, Québec. Consumption of 
warfarin or a new oral anticoagulant was documented. Medical record data were
used to determine each patient's frailty status using the Clinical Frailty Scale 
(CFS) and to evaluate the risk of stroke (CHADS2 [Congestive Heart Failure,
Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack]) and bleeding
(HAS-BLED [Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history 
or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly (> 65 years)
Drugs/alcohol concomitantly]). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression 
analyses were used to examine the effect of frailty status and the risk of stroke
and bleeding on the probability of receiving anticoagulation therapy.
RESULTS: Seventy percent of octogenarians with AF received anticoagulation
therapy (n = 475). A high risk of stroke (CHADS2 = 3 compared with CHADS2 = 1,
odds ratio [OR], 3.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-11.77), and the absence
of severe frailty (CFS < 7; OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.84-6.33) were independently
associated with anticoagulant use in multivariable analyses. A high risk of
bleeding (HAS-BLED score ≥ 3; OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.86) was associated with
the absence of anticoagulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a higher prevalence of appropriate
anticoagulation among octogenarians with AF than reported in previous studies.
Further work is needed to develop and disseminate tools to optimize the use of
anticoagulants in this high-risk population.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) is
increasingly performed in nonagenarians. There is scarce evidence on the
feasibility and safety of balloon-expandable TAVI in this patient population. A
total of 734 patients who underwent balloon-expandable TAVI at our institute were
included in the study. We compared 136 patients who were aged at least 90 years
at the time of TAVI (mean age 92.4 ± 2.4 years) with the remaining 598 younger
patients (mean age 79.7 ± 7.8 years). Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 end
points were compared between the 2 groups. Diabetes mellitus, coronary artery
disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and chronic lung disease were
significantly less prevalent in patients aged ≥90 years. In contrast, the
prevalence of frailty, chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation was
significantly higher in these patients. Device success was 96% in both groups.
All-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year was 2.9% and 12.5% versus 2.8% and
12.3% in patients aged ≥90 and <90, respectively (p = 0.95 for both). All major
complication rates were similar between groups. Nonagenarians had higher rates of
minor vascular complications (13.2% vs 7.7%; p = 0.04). In conclusion, performing
balloon-expandable TAVI in carefully selected group of nonagenarians is feasible 
and offers clinical benefit comparable to patients aged <90 years. Advanced age, 
in the absence of significant co-morbidities, should not deter clinicians from
evaluating patients for TAVI for severe AS.

Elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years old) use up to 30% of all commonly prescribed
medication, and they suffer more their adverse effects than the general
population. In order to minimize this risk, physicians should avoid polypharmacy,
dangerous pharmacological interactions and take into account pharmacodynamic and 
senile pharmacokinetic changes before prescribing any medication to the elderly. 
The present review article originally describes how renal physiology changes
secondary to aging such as dysautonomia, glomerular filtration rate reduction,
tubular back-filtration, sodium, calcium and magnesium loss, potassium retention,
altered dilution-concentration capability, tubular frailty, genetics, internal
milieu and body composition are senile changes that when combined predispose
elderly people to suffer from pharmacological adverse effects. Knowledge of these
physiological modifications associated with aging and their impact on the
pharmacology of particular drugs may help to optimize drug use and to avoid
complications in this age group.

BACKGROUND: Time in therapeutic range (TTR) of international normalized ratio
(INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 is important for the safety and effectiveness of warfarin
anticoagulation. There are few data on TTR among patients with atrial
fibrillation (AF) in community-based clinical practice.
METHODS: Using the US Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial
Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF), we examined TTR (using a modified Rosendaal method)
among 5,210 patients with AF on warfarin and treated at 155 sites. Patients were 
grouped into quartiles based on TTR data. Multivariable logistic regression
modeling with generalized estimating equations was used to determine patient and 
provider factors associated with the lowest (worst) TTR.
RESULTS: Overall, 59% of the measured INR values were between 2.0 and 3.0, with
an overall mean and median TTR of 65% ± 20% and 68% (interquartile range [IQR]
53%-79%). The median times below and above the therapeutic range were 17% (IQR
8%-29%) and 10% (IQR 3%-19%), respectively. Patients with renal dysfunction,
advanced heart failure, frailty, prior valve surgery, and higher risk for
bleeding (ATRIA score) or stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score) had significantly lower TTR
(P < .0001 for all). Patients treated at anticoagulation clinics had only
slightly higher median TTR (69%) than those not (66%) (P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AF in US clinical practices, TTR on warfarin is 
suboptimal, and those at highest predicted risks for stroke and bleeding were
least likely to be in therapeutic range.

Falls and mineral and bones disorders are both implicated in the occurrence of
pathological fractures in patients undergoing chronic dialysis. However, data on 
falls among this population are rare. We carried out a prospective study during
four weeks and included 70 patients on chronic hemodialysis with the main
objectives being to evaluate the incidence of falls and factors related to it. At
the end of the four weeks, 16 patients (22.86%) fell at least once, with a total 
of 17 falls during 4 weeks, giving an incidence of 3.2 falls per patient/year.
The mean age was 40 ± 16 years. Five patients (31.2%) had a past history of
pathological fractures. Ten patients (62.5%) presented intra- and post-dialysis
hypotension, six (37.5%) was diagnosed of gait disorders and two (12.5%) had
sensory deficit of the lower limbs. Six patients (37.5%) presented frailty.
Hypotension (P=0.004), frailty (P=0.047) and sensory deficit (P=0.049) were
significantly associated with the occurrence of falls. The incidence of falls is 
relatively high in our hemodialysis patients and real risk factors exist. Hence, 
it is important to implement programs for falls prevention to reduce their
incidence and impact.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition 
with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more
frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other
chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in
pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an
outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was
modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was
used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed 
using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.
RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were
significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those 
who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of
frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was
significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower
physical and mental quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in
pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential
role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of
life.

BACKGROUND: Hospitalised older patients are complex. Comorbidity and polypharmacy
complicate frailty. Significant numbers have dementia and/or cognitive
impairment. Pain is highly prevalent. The evidence base for pain management in
cognitively impaired individuals is sparse due to methodological issues. A wealth
of expert opinion is recognised potentially providing a useful evidence base for 
guiding clinical practice. The study aimed to gather expert opinion on pain
management in cognitively impaired hospitalised older people.
METHODS: Consultant Geriatricians listed as dementia leads in the National
Dementia Audit were contacted electronically and invited to respond. The
questionnaire sought information on their role, confidence and approach to pain
management in cognitively impaired hospitalised patients. Responses were analysed
using a mixed methods approach.
RESULTS: Respondents considered themselves very confident in the clinical field. 
Awareness of potential to do harm was highly evident. Unequivocally responses
suggested paracetamol is safe and should be first choice analgesic, newer opiates
should be used preferentially in renal impairment and nefopam is unsafe. A
grading of the safety profile of specific medications became apparent, prompting 
requirement for further evaluation and holistic assessment.
CONCLUSION: The lack of consensus reached highlights the complexity of this
clinical field. The use of paracetamol first line, newer opiates in renal
impairment and avoidance of nefopam are immediately transferrable to clinical
practice. Further review, evaluation and comparison of the risks associated with 
other specific analgesics are necessary before a comprehensive clinical guideline
can be produced.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

Body composition in chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and
nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney
disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia
are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here.
RECENT FINDINGS: The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among
the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The
association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD 
stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely
associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger
associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy
supplementation combined with low-protein diet for the management of CKD may
prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but
dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis 
therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum
bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23 mEq/l for
nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A
benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven.
SUMMARY: Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and
integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing
comorbidities.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients 
on dialysis; however, previous studies have not taken into account the severity
of frailty as a predictor of outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess if
there was an association between the degree of frailty and mortality among
patients on incident dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A cohort study of incident chronic
dialysis patients was conducted between January of 2009 and June of 2013 (last
follow-up in December of 2013). On the basis of overall clinical impression, the 
Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score was determined for patients at the start of
dialysis by their primary nephrologist. This simple scale allocates a single
point to different states of frailty (1, very fit; 2, well; 3, managing well; 4, 
vulnerable; 5, mildly frail; 6, moderately frail; 7, severely frail or terminally
ill) with an emphasis on function of the assessed individual. The primary outcome
was time to death. Patients were censored at the time of transplantation.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 390 patients with completed CFS scores (mean age
of 63±15 years old). Most were Caucasian (89%) and men (67%), and 30% of patients
had ESRD caused by diabetic nephropathy. The median Charlson Comorbidity Index
score was 4 (interquartile range =3-6), and the median CFS score was 4
(interquartile range =2-5). There were 96 deaths over 750 patient-years at risk. 
In an adjusted Cox survival analysis, the hazard ratio associated with each
1-point increase in the CFS was 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.43;
P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher severity of frailty (as defined by the CFS) at dialysis
initiation is associated with higher mortality.

Bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3) is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) member of the bombesin receptor family. Several studies have suggested an 
association between obesity, alterations in glucose metabolism, diabetes and the 
BRS-3 receptor. In this study, we focused on patients simultaneously diagnosed
with obesity and type 2 diabetes (OB/T2D). The analysis of BRS-3 expression in
the skeletal muscle of these patients revealed a marked decrease in the
expression of BRS-3 at the mRNA (23.6 ± 1.3-fold downregulation, p<0.0001) and
protein level (49 ± 7% decrease, p<0.05) compared to the normal patients (no
obesity and diabetes). Moreover, in cultured primary myocytes from patients with 
OB/T2D, the synthetic BRS-3 agonist, [D-Try6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]bombesin6-14,
significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), p90RSK1, protein kinase B (PKB) and p70s6K. Specifically, the
ligand at 10-11 M induced the maximal phosphorylation of MAPKs (p42, 159 ± 15% of
the control; p44, 166 ± 11% of the control; p<0.0001) and p90RSK1 (148 ± 2% of
the control, p<0.0001). The basal phosphorylation levels of all kinases were
reduced (p<0.05) in the patients with OB/T2D compared to the normal patients.
Furthermore, the BRS-3 agonist stimulated glucose transport, which was already
detected at 10-12 M (133 ± 9% of the control), reached maximal levels at 10-11 M 
(160 ± 9%, p<0.0001) and was maintained at up to 10-8 M (overall mean, 153 ± 7%; 
p < 0.007). This effect was less promiment than that attained with 10-8 M insulin
(202 ± 9%, p = 0.009). The effect of the agonist on glycogen synthase a activity 
achieved the maximum effect at 10-11 M (165 ± 16% of the control; p<0.0001),
which did not differ from that observed with higher concentrations of the
agonist. These results suggest that muscle cells isolated from patients with
OB/T2D have extremely high sensitivity to the synthetic ligand, and the effects
are particularly observed on MAPK and p90RSK1 phosphorylation, as well as glucose
uptake. Moreover, our data indicate that BRS-3 may prove to be useful as a
potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with OB/T2D.

AIM: Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on its impact
on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different
self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these patients has not been
attempted before.
METHODS: A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural centre was
recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered
to these patients. Clinical and dialysis-related laboratory parameters were
collected. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis
complications were performed, and variables demonstrating significant
correlations were entered into multivariate regression models to determine their 
independent associations.
RESULTS: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail
Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and
Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic
dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire showed significant association with each
other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated
significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher Liu's
comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and creatinine
levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The other five
questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important
dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis
identified an independently negative association between serum albumin and the
simple FRAIL scale results (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study establishing the utility of different
self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients.
The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a closer relationship with
dialysis-related complications.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Testosterone among Patients with End-Stage Renal
Disease.

Bao Y(1), Johansen KL.

Author information: 
(1)John Muir Medical Group, Walnut Creek, California.

The prevalence of low testosterone level is particularly high among patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been associated with mortality. In
populations without ESRD, low testosterone level has also been associated with a 
number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low
muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty. However, there
is controversy regarding what constitutes low testosterone level in the aging
population and at what level replacement therapy with testosterone is indicated. 
There are no randomized controlled trials investigating long-term outcomes of
testosterone replacement therapy in populations with or without ESRD. Available
trial results suggest equivocal improvements in sexual function. Muscle mass and 
bone mineral density appear to improve, but results in physical function and
performance are mixed and there are no data on fracture prevention. Some recent
data suggest harm when testosterone was given to men with limited mobility.
Finally, there is little evidence that testosterone adds to existing
erythropoietin agents in the treatment of anemia in ESRD. Due to lack of evidence
supporting long-term use of testosterone, the authors recommend against the
routine use of testosterone in ESRD patients with low testosterone levels.
Testosterone treatment can be considered in those with low bone mass and total
testosterone level <200 ng/dl, or in younger patients with sexual complaints with
total testosterone level lower than the reference range. It is important to
engage patients in discussion of risks and benefits before initiating
testosterone therapy; testosterone therapy should be discontinued if the intended
treatment effect is not observed after short-term use.

Renal functional reserve and renal recovery after acute kidney injury.

Sharma A(1), Mucino MJ, Ronco C.

Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.

Renal functional reserve (RFR) represents the capacity of the kidney to increase 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to certain physiological or
pathological stimuli or conditions. Once baseline GFR is determined, RFR can be
assessed clinically after an oral protein load or intravenous amino acid
infusion. In clinical practice, baseline GFR displays variable levels due to diet
or other factors. RFR is the difference between peak 'stress' GFR induced by the 
test (p.o. or i.v.) and the baseline GFR. In clinical scenarios where
hyperfiltration is present (high baseline GFR due to pregnancy, hypertension or
diabetic nephropathy, in solitary kidney or kidney donors), RFR may be fully or
partially used to achieve normal or supranormal renal function. Since commonly
used renal function markers, such as GFR, may remain within normal ranges until
50% of nephrons are lost or in patients with a single remnant kidney, the RFR
test may represent a sensitive and early way to assess the functional decline in 
the kidney. RFR assessment may become an important tool to evaluate the ability
of the kidney to recover completely or partially after a kidney attack. In case
of healing with a defect and progressive fibrosis, recovery may appear complete
clinically, but a reduced RFR may be a sign of a maladaptive repair or
subclinical loss of renal mass. Thus, a reduction in RFR may represent the
equivalent of renal frailty or susceptibility to insults. The main aim of this
article is to review the concept of RFR, its utility in different clinical
scenarios, and future perspective for its use.

Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults in Primary and Secondary Care.

The Renal National Service Framework (NSF), and the subsequent NICE Clinical
Practice Guideline for early identification and management of adults with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) in primary and secondary care (CG73), served to emphasise
the change in focus in renal medicine from treatment of established kidney
disease to earlier identification and prevention of kidney disease. CKD describes
abnormal kidney function and/or structure. It is common, frequently unrecognised 
and often coexists with other conditions (for example, cardiovascular disease and
diabetes). Moderate to severe CKD also carries an increased risk of other
significant adverse outcomes such acute kidney injury, falls, frailty and
mortality. The risk of developing CKD increases with increasing age, and some
conditions that coexist with CKD become more severe and increasingly prevalent as
kidney dysfunction advances. CKD can progress to end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD)in a small but significant percentage of people. CKD is usually
asymptomatic but it is detectable, and tests for detecting CKD are both simple
and freely available. There is evidence that treatment can prevent or delay the
progression of CKD, reduce or prevent the development of complications and reduce
the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, because of a lack of specific
symptoms, CKD frequently remains undetected and unrecognised. As a consequence
people with CKD are often not diagnosed, or diagnosed late when CKD is at an
advanced stage. Late diagnosis is associated with increased morbidity, mortality 
and healthcare associated costs.

The prevalence of aortic valve stenosis (AS) is growing in developed countries
because its prevalence increases with age. A growing number of elderly patients
are currently referred to specialized centres to be evaluated for potential
therapeutic strategies. Indeed, two techniques are nowadays able to treat
high-risk AS patients: TAVI and surgical replacement (AVR). It is the purpose of 
the present review to summarize current knowledge on safety and efficacy of AVR
and TAVI in high-risk patients; to focus on some aspects of recently published
guidelines; to emphasize the growing importance of pre-operative individual risk 
assessment, which is considered the real crucial point for patient selection and 
trial's comparisons. Indeed, it is worth of noting that currently adopted
risk-scores do not show satisfactory performances. Accordingly, it becomes of
utmost importance to investigate several baseline but still neglected patients'
characteristics (e.g. frailty, functional status, co-morbid conditions, etc.), as
well as their pathogenetic relationships with interventional results and
follow-up prognosis. All these items are emphasized in the present review.
Finally, we have tried to anticipate future scenarios in terms of both ongoing
clinical trials and improvements of risk-scores.

OBJECTIVE: Current preoperative assessments for cardiac surgery, such as the
European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II and the Society of
Thoracic Surgeons risk score, are limited in their ability to predict
postoperative outcomes. This is thought to be due to the reliance on
chronological age as a predictor of health. In geriatrics, frailty assessments
have been developed as a tool in determining physiologic functioning capacity.
Whether or not frailty predicts postoperative outcomes independent of existing
cardiac preoperative risk scores remains unknown.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review to determine the association of frailty
with negative postoperative outcomes such as major adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We
searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, and Ageline from inception until
July 2013 and screened 5913 abstracts for potential inclusion. Of these, 6
studies examined the relationship between objective frailty assessments and
postoperative outcomes. Our included studies evaluated 4756 patients undergoing
cardiac surgery.
RESULTS: Frailty, defined using multiple criteria, had a strong positive
relationship with the risk of MACCE (odds ratio, 4.89; 95% confidence interval,
1.64-14.60). Relationships were stronger in older patients undergoing
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) than younger patients undergoing
coronary artery bypass grafting and valvular surgery (hazard ratio for frailty in
TAVR, 3.31-4.89 vs hazard ratio for non-TAVR, 1.10-3.16).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients deemed frail, determined using an objective assessment
tool, have a higher likelihood of experiencing mortality, morbidity, functional
decline, and MACCE following cardiac surgery, regardless of definition. Further
study is needed to determine which components of frailty are most predictive of
negative postoperative outcomes before integration in risk prediction scores.

Hemodialysis (HD) is routinely offered to patients with end-stage renal disease
in the United States who are ineligible for other renal replacement modalities.
The frequency of HD among the US population is greater than all other countries, 
except Taiwan and Japan. In US, patients are often dialyzed irrespective of age, 
comorbidities, prognosis, or decision-making capacity. Determination of when
patients can no longer dialyze is variable and can be dialysis-center specific.
Determinants may be related to progressive comorbidities and frailty, mobility or
access issues, patient self-determination, or an inability to tolerate the
treatment safely for any number of reasons (e.g., hypotension, behavioral
issues). Behavioral issues may impact the safety of not only patients themselves,
but also those around them. In this article the authors present the case of an
elderly patient on HD with progressive cognitive impairment and combative
behavior placing him and others at risk of physical harm. The authors discuss the
medical, ethical, legal, and psychosocial challenges to care of such patients who
lack decision-making capacity with a focus on variable approaches by regions and 
culture. This manuscript provides recommendations and highlights resources to
assist nephrologists, dialysis personnel, ethics consultants, and palliative
medicine teams in managing such patients to resolve conflict.

IMPORTANCE: The Frailty Index (FI) is a known predictor of adverse outcomes in
geriatric patients. The usefulness of the FI as an outcome measure in geriatric
trauma patients is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the FI as an effective assessment tool in 
predicting adverse outcomes in geriatric trauma patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-year (June 2011 to February 2013)
prospective cohort study at a level I trauma center at the University of Arizona.
We prospectively measured frailty in all geriatric trauma patients. Geriatric
patients were defined as those 65 years or older. The FI was calculated using 50 
preadmission frailty variables. Frailty in patients was defined by an FI of 0.25 
or higher.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was in-hospital
complications. The secondary outcome measure was adverse discharge disposition.
In-hospital complications were defined as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious,
hematologic, renal, and reoperation. Adverse discharge disposition was defined as
discharge to a skilled nursing facility or in-hospital mortality. Multivariate
logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between the FI and
outcomes.
RESULTS: In total, 250 patients were enrolled, with a mean (SD) age of 77.9 (8.1)
years, median Injury Severity Score of 15 (range, 9-18), median Glasgow Coma
Scale score of 15 (range, 12-15), and mean (SD) FI of 0.21 (0.10). Forty-four
percent (n = 110) of patients had frailty. Patients with frailty were more likely
to have in-hospital complications (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-6.0; P = .001)
and adverse discharge disposition (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4; P = .001).
The mortality rate was 2.0% (n = 5), and all patients who died had frailty.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The FI is an independent predictor of in-hospital
complications and adverse discharge disposition in geriatric trauma patients.
This index should be used as a clinical tool for risk stratification in this
patient group.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors can minimize the hypoglycaemic burden and
enhance safety in elderly people with diabetes.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among elderly people is
increasing. Often associated with disabilities/comorbidities, T2DM lowers the
chances of successful aging and is independently associated with frailty and an
increased risk of hypoglycaemia, which can be further exacerbated by
antihyperglycaemic treatment. From this perspective, the clinical management of
T2DM in the elderly is challenging and requires individualization of optimum
glycaemic targets depending on comorbidities, cognitive functioning and ability
to recognize and self-manage the disease. The lack of solid evidence-based
medicine supporting treatment guidelines for older people with diabetes further
complicates the matter. Several classes of medicine for the treatment of T2DM are
currently available and different drug combinations are often required to achieve
individualized glycaemic goals. Many of these drugs, however, carry disadvantages
such as the propensity to cause weight gain or hypoglycaemia. Dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, a recent addition to the pharmacological
armamentarium, have become widely accepted in clinical practice because of their 
efficacy, low risk of hypoglycaemia, neutral effect on body weight, and
apparently greater safety in patients with kidney failure. Although more
information is needed to reach definitive conclusions, growing evidence suggests 
that DPP-4 inhibitors may become a valuable component in the pharmacological
management of elderly people with T2DM. The present review aims to delineate the 
potential advantages of this pharmacological approach in the treatment of elderly
people with T2DM.

BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides
(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

The increase proportion of older persons is continuously growing in worldwide,
especially in Japan. Subsequently, the number of older adults with type 2
diabetes is also increasing. Older adults with diabetes are at substantial risk
of frailty, cognitive impairment, and physical disability. They are also at
greater risk for polypharmacy, depression, urinary incontinence, injurious fall, 
and persistent pain. Thus, older patients are a very heterogenous group of
individuals. Hypoglycemia is a frequent adverse effect of treatment with
sulfonylurea, glinides, or insulin in older adults with diabetes. In this review,
we describe the efficacy and safety of some anti-diabetic oral agents used in
older adults with type 2 diabetes, including an incretin-based drug dipeptidyl
peptidase 4(DPP4) inhibitors.

The number of elderly patients undergoing anesthesia is increasing. At the same
time aging is associated with decreased functional reserve of all major organ
systems and an increase in comorbid conditions, requiring a comprehensive
perioperative evaluation to minimize morbidity and mortality. The preoperative
assessment should focus on the risk/benefit analysis vis-à-vis the proposed
intervention, allowing the practitioner to adapt surgical and anesthetic care, as
well optimize health and functional status. In addition to the usual evaluation
for cardiac and pulmonary risk, the preoperative assessment in the older patient 
should also address the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium.
'Do-not-resuscitate' orders must be clarified with the patients or substitute
decision maker. Studies have not been able to clearly show the superiority of one
anesthetic approach for the geriatric patient, although there are probably
advantages to using regional anesthetic techniques. Overall the patient's
preoperative functional status along with the proposed intervention is the
primary determinants of the patient's long term functional outcome and wellbeing.
The elderly patient may be at his most vulnerable during the postoperative phase,
and a relatively high frequency of adverse events in the elderly, including
respiratory insufficiency, myocardial and cerebrovascular ischemia, renal
failure, infectious complications as well as delirium and postoperative cognitive
dysfunction have been observed. Perioperative interventions should target
modifiable risk factors and the avoidance of even minor complications with an
ultimate goal of improving long-term outcome.

Thoughtful decision-making in a patient with cancer and kidney disease requires a
comprehensive discussion of prognosis and therapy options for both conditions
framed by the individual's preferences and goals of care. An estimate of overall 
prognosis is generated that includes the patient's clinical presentation and
parameters associated with adverse outcomes, such as age, performance status,
frailty, malnutrition, and comorbidities. Empathic communication of this
information using a shared decision-making approach can lead to an informed
decision that respects patient autonomy and is consistent with the patient's
"big-picture" goals and personal values.

OBJECTIVE: Despite demonstration of the superior outcomes of transcatheter aortic
valve implantation (TAVI) versus optimal medical therapy for severe left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, studies comparing TAVI and surgical aortic
valve replacement (AVR) in this high-risk group have been lacking.
METHODS: We performed propensity matching for age, gender, baseline
comorbidities, previous interventions, priority at hospital admission, frailty
score, New York Heart Association class, EuroSCORE, and associated cardiac
diseases. Next, the 30-day mortality and procedure-related morbidity of 162
patients (81 TAVI vs 81 AVR) with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(ejection fraction ≤ 35%) were analyzed at the Italian National Institute of
Health.
RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was comparable (P = .37) between the 2 groups. The 
incidence of periprocedural acute myocardial infarction (P = .55), low output
state (P = .27), stroke (P = .36), and renal dysfunction (peak creatinine level, 
P = .57) was also similar between the 2 groups. TAVI resulted in significantly
greater postprocedural permanent pacemaker implantation (P = .01) and AVR in more
periprocedural transfusions (P < .01) despite a similar transfusion rate per
patient (2.8 ± 3.7 for TAVI vs 4.4 ± 3.8 for AVR; P = .08). The postprocedural
intensive care unit stay (median, 2 days after TAVI vs 3 days after AVR; P =
.34), intermediate care unit stay (median, 0 days after both TAVI and AVR; P =
.94), and hospitalization (median, 11 days after TAVI vs 14 days after AVR; P =
.51) were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, both 
TAVI and AVR are valid treatment options, with comparable hospital mortality and 
periprocedural morbidity. Comparisons of the mid- to long-term outcomes are
mandatory.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical
function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness
and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a
heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of
this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general
population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science,
CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD
and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text
review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. 
From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in
patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with
increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. 
In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher 
risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished
physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may 
lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to
understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with
clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of falls, with
subsequent complications including fractures, loss of independence,
hospitalization, and institutionalization. Factors associated with falls are
poorly understood in this population. We hypothesized that insights derived from 
studies of the elderly might apply to adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis;
we focused on frailty, a phenotype of physiological decline strongly associated
with falls in the elderly.
METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study of 95 patients undergoing
hemodialysis (1/2009-3/2010), the association of frailty with future falls was
explored using adjusted Poisson regression. Frailty was classified using the
criteria established by Fried et al., as a combination of five components:
shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed.
RESULTS: Over a median 6.7-month period of longitudinal follow-up, 28.3% of study
participants (25.9% of those under 65, 29.3% of those 65 and older) experienced a
fall. After adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidity, disability, number of
medications, marital status, and education, frailty independently predicted a
3.09-fold (95% CI: 1.38-6.90, P=0.006) higher number of falls. This relationship 
between frailty and falls did not differ for younger and older adults (P=0.57).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, a validated construct in the elderly, was a strong and
independent predictor of falls in adults undergoing hemodialysis, regardless of
age. Our results may aid in identifying frail hemodialysis patients who could be 
targeted for multidimensional fall prevention strategies.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether higher cystatin C would be associated with
greater frailty in men aged 65 and older.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study.
SETTING: Six U.S. sites.
PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of community-dwelling men aged 65 and older
enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study (mean age 73.8; 9.8%
frail and 47.2% intermediate frailty; N = 1,602).
MEASUREMENTS: Serum cystatin C, creatinine, and frailty were measured. Frailty
was analyzed as an ordinal outcome of robust, intermediate frailty, and frail
using a multinomial logistic regression model, and the base model was adjusted
for age, race, and clinical site.
RESULTS: Higher cystatin C was associated with seven times greater odds of being 
frail than being robust (odds ratio (OR) quartile 4 vs 1 = 7.12, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 3.76-13.46) and 2.4 times greater odds of intermediate frailty
than robust (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.70-3.32). The association was 
attenuated but persisted after adjusting for multiple possible confounders. In
contrast, neither higher serum creatinine (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.36, 95% CI =
0.78-2.40) nor lower creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR
quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.54-1.87) was associated in a graded manner
with greater odds of frailty.
CONCLUSION: Higher cystatin C, but not creatinine-based measures, was associated 
with greater odds of frailty in this cohort of older men.

BACKGROUND: Despite the well-known impact of female sex on outcome after surgical
aortic valve replacement (sAVR), few studies investigated its role after
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: After propensity-matching for age, baseline comorbidities, previous
interventions, priority, frailty score, New York Heart Association class, left
ventricular function and associated cardiac diseases, hospital mortality, and
procedure-related morbidities of 388 women (194 TAVR versus 194 sAVR)-of 5,231
patients enrolled in 70 centers participating in this prospective multicenter
national registry-were analyzed at a central management unit of the Italian
National Institute of Health.
RESULTS: Although hospital mortality was comparable (4.1% TAVR versus 3.1% sAVR; 
p = 0.177), women undergoing sAVR showed a higher rate of transfusion (63.9%
versus 37.1% TAVR; p = 0.0001); higher number of transfusions per patient (3.6 ± 
0.4 versus 2.3 ± 0.3 TAVR; p = 0.049); a higher incidence of low cardiac output
state (5.7% versus 3.6% TAVR; p = 0.017) and acute renal failure (8.8% versus
4.1% TAVR; p = 0.01); and higher mean transprosthetic gradients (15.7 ± 12.6 mm
Hg versus 11.9 ± 10.7 mm Hg TAVR; p = 0.004). In contrast, women undergoing TAVR 
experienced significant postprocedural aortic regurgitation (mild, 37.6% versus
7.7% sAVR; moderate-to-severe, 7.1% versus 1.5% sAVR; p = 0.0001) and a higher
rate of stroke (7.7% versus 2.5% sAVR; p = 0.037), major vascular complications
(9.3% versus 0.5% sAVR; p = 0.0001), pacemaker implantation (12.4% versus 6.2%
sAVR; p = 0.004), need for emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (1.0%
versus 0% sAVR; p = 0.007), and longer intermediate care unit length of stay (2.5
± 4.4 days versus 1.4 ± 2.6 days sAVR; p = 0.008). Perioperative myocardial
infarction and lengths of intensive care unit stay and hospitalization were
comparable (not significant).
CONCLUSIONS: Women undergoing sAVR and TAVR experienced different periprocedural 
morbidities. These data strongly suggest the need to strictly individualize the
indications.

BACKGROUND: Quality improvement initiatives in cardiac surgery largely rely on
risk prediction models. Most often, these models include isolated populations and
describe isolated end-points. However, with the changing clinical profile of the 
cardiac surgical patients, mixed populations models are required to accurately
represent the majority of the surgical population. Also, composite model
end-points of morbidity and mortality, better reflect outcomes experienced by
patients.
METHODS: The model development cohort included 4,270 patients who underwent
aortic or mitral valve replacement, or mitral valve repair with/without coronary 
artery bypass grafting, or isolated coronary artery bypass grafting. A composite 
end-point of infection, stroke, acute renal failure, or death was evaluated. Age,
sex, surgical priority, and procedure were forced, a priori, into the model and
then stepwise selection of candidate variables was utilized. Model performance
was evaluated by concordance statistic, Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit, and
calibration plots. Bootstrap technique was employed to validate the model.
RESULTS: The model included 16 variables. Several variables were significant such
as, emergent surgical priority (OR 4.3; 95% CI 2.9-7.4), CABG + Valve procedure
(OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.8-3.0), and frailty (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.5), among others. The
concordance statistic for the major adverse cardiac events model in a mixed
population was 0.764 (95% CL; 0.75-0.79) and had excellent calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: Development of predictive models with composite end-points and mixed
procedure population can yield robust statistical and clinical validity. As they 
more accurately reflect current cardiac surgical profile, models such as this,
are an essential tool in quality improvement efforts.

An appropriate treatment of elderly rheumatic patients implements comprehensive
diagnostics and exclusion diagnostics of e.g. coronary heart disease,
osteoporosis, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2 and thyroid gland
dysfunction. Furthermore, the complex disease situation might require the
integration of other faculties or might be a reason for inpatient treatment. The 
complexity in the treatment of multimorbid elderly patients suffering from
rheumatism not only rises with increasing age but also constitutes a considerable
challenge due to existing incapacities and preceding as well as currently
performed immunosuppressive therapies. The necessary treatment framework is
outlined from the perspective of rheumatologists and geriatricians. Typical
geriatric symptoms, such as malnutrition, immobility and frailty might be
enhanced if multimorbidity is simultaneously present.

BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation
(TAVI), the role of sex on outcome after TAVI or surgical aortic valve
replacement (AVR) has been poorly investigated. We investigated the impact of sex
on outcome after TAVI or AVR.
METHODS: There were 2108 patients undergoing TAVI or AVR who were enrolled in the
Italian Observational Multicenter Registry (OBSERVANT). Thirty-day mortality,
major periprocedural morbidity, and transprosthetic gradients were stratified by 
sex according to interventions.
RESULTS: Female AVR patients showed a worse risk profile compared with male AVR
patients, given the higher mean age, prevalence of frailty score of 2 or higher, 
New York Heart Association class of 3 or higher, lower body weight, and
preoperative hemoglobin level (P ≤ .02). Similarly, female TAVI patients had a
different risk profile than male TAVI patients, given a higher age and a lower
body weight and preoperative hemoglobin level (P ≤ .005), but with a similar New 
York Heart Association class, frailty score, EuroSCORE (P = NS), a better left
ventricular ejection fraction and a lower prevalence of left ventricular ejection
fraction less than 30%, porcelain aorta, renal dysfunction, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, arteriopathy, and previous cardiovascular surgery or
percutaneous coronary intervention (P ≤ .01). Women showed a smaller aortic
annulus than men in both populations (P < .001). Female sex was an independent
predictor in the AVR population for risk-adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio
[OR], 2.34; P = .043) and transfusions (OR, 1.47; P = .003), but not for
risk-adjusted acute myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular complications,
permanent atrioventricular block (P = NS). Female sex was an independent
predictor in the TAVI population for risk-adjusted major vascular complications
(OR, 2.92; P = .018) and transfusions (OR, 1.93; P = .003), but proved protective
against moderate to severe postprocedural aortic insufficiency (P = .018).
CONCLUSIONS: Female sex is a risk factor for mortality after aortic valve
replacement, for major vascular complications after TAVI, and for transfusions
after both approaches.

Bone fracture risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher
than that in healthy subjects. Frailty caused by neuromuscular impairment as well
as bone fragility due to bone loss and impaired bone quality is thought to be
involved in the elevated fracture risk in CKD. Altered material and structural
properties might be attributed to the reduced bone strength. The structural
properties in CKD patients are characterized in 1) cortical thinning and cortical
porosity, and 2) irregular thickening and loss of connectivity in trabecular
bone. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that skeletal changes in the
structural properties may be initiated at earlier stage of CKD than we expected.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and serious condition in the elderly. AF
affects between 600,000 and one million patients in France, two-thirds of whom
are aged above 75 years. AF is a predictive factor for mortality in the elderly
and a major risk factor for stroke. Co-morbidities are frequent and worsen the
prognosis. The management of AF in the elderly should involve a comprehensive
geriatric assessment (CGA), which analyses both medical and psychosocial
elements, enabling evaluation of the patient's functional status and social
situation and the identification of co-morbidities. The CGA enables the detection
of "frailty" using screening tools assessing cognitive function, risk of falls,
nutritional status, mood disorders, autonomy and social environment. The
objectives of AF treatment in the elderly are to prevent AF complications,
particularly stroke, and improve quality of life. Specific precautions for
treatment must be taken because of the co-morbidities and age-related changes in 
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Preventing AF complications relies mainly
on anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulants are recommended in patients with AF aged
75 years or above after assessing the bleeding risk using the HEMORR2HAGES or
HAS-BLED scores. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are promising treatments,
especially due to a lower risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. However, their
prescriptions should take into account renal function (creatinine clearance
assessed with Cockcroft formula) and cognitive function (for adherence to
treatment). Studies including frail patients in "real life" are necessary to
evaluate tolerance of NOACs. Management of AF also involves the treatment of
underlying cardiomyopathy and heart rate control rather than a rhythm-control
strategy as first-line therapy for elderly patients, especially if they are
paucisymptomatic. Antiarrhythmic drugs should be used carefully in elderly
patients because of the frequency of metabolic abnormalities and higher risk of
drug interactions and bradycardia.

The panoply of treatment algorithms, periodically released to improve guidance,
is one mean to face therapeutic uncertainty in pharmacological management of
hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, especially after metformin failure. Failure of 
recent guidelines to give advice on the use of specific antidiabetic drugs in
patients with co-morbidity may generate further uncertainty, given the frequent
association of type 2 diabetes with common comorbidity, including, although not
limited to obesity, cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, and frailty.
The Italian Association of Diabetologists (Associazione Medici Diabetologi, AMD) 
recognized the need to develop personalized treatment plans for people with type 
2 diabetes, taking into account the patients' individual profile (phenotype),
with the objective of the safest possible glycemic control. As not every subject 
with type 2 diabetes benefits from intensive glycemic control, flexible regimens 
of treatment with diabetes drugs (including insulin) are needed for reaching
individualized glycemic goals. Whether personalized diabetology will improve the 
quality healthcare practice of diabetes management is unknown, but specific
research has been launched.

The microcirculation plays an important role in bone health. Here, we examine
whether albuminuria, a marker of renal microvascular disease, is associated with 
the risk of hip fracture in older adults (age, 78 years). We find a small
independent association in women but not in men.INTRODUCTION: The microvascular
circulation plays an important role in bone physiology. Two studies of
middle-aged adults have found that albuminuria (>30 mg albumin/g creatinine), a
disorder of the renal microvasculature, is associated with fracture risk. Here,
we examine whether albuminuria is related to hip fracture risk and reduced hip
bone mineral density (BMD) in older adults with a mean age of 78 years.
METHODS: From the Cardiovascular Health Study (41 % male), 3,110 adults with
albuminuria testing were followed up for incident hip fracture for up to
9.5 years. BMD was performed in a subset of 1,208 participants.
RESULTS: There were 313 hip fractures during follow-up (7.7 % of men; 11.7 % of
women). The incidence rate for men, with and without albuminuria, was 1.43 and
0.93/100 person-years of follow-up (p = 0.02); for women, 1.84 and 1.33
(p = 0.04). After adjustment for osteoporosis-related factors, frailty and
falling, a doubling of albuminuria was significantly associated with hip fracture
risk in women (hazard ratio, 1.12, 95 % CI, 1.001-1.25), but not in men. In the
subcohort with BMD measurement, increased urine albumin levels were significantly
associated with decreased total hip BMD in men (-0.009 g calcium/cm(2) (-0.017,
-0.001); p = 0.04), but not in women.
CONCLUSIONS: In older women, albuminuria is associated with a small, but
statistically significant, increased risk of hip fracture independent of other
explanatory factors. No such risk appears to be present in men, although their
total hip BMD is lower in association with albuminuria.

Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of
Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and
catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate
with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and
provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of
PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology
of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition)
due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent 
factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include
uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent
inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of
hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition,
comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the
dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW.

BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in management have been highlighted as contributory
factors in the death of many patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). However,
there is little evidence addressing the quality of care provided to patients with
milder AKI.
AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of care provided to a
non-select cohort of patients with AKI and evaluate discrepancies in causation,
recognition and management.
DESIGN: Retrospective inception cohort study.
METHODS: Demographic data were collected for all 1577 patients admitted to a
University Teaching Hospital during a 1-month period. Baseline, admission and
peak creatinine were correlated with mortality and length of hospital admission. 
AKI was classified according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
criteria. A retrospective case note review of all patients with AKI was carried
out to evaluate quality of documentation and clinical management of AKI.
Multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors for AKI.
RESULTS: Incidence of AKI on admission was 4.6%. A further 10.3% developed AKI
while in hospital. All cause mortality was 4-fold higher among patients with AKI 
compared with those without (19 vs. 3.8%; P < 0.001). Mortality was significantly
higher in those patients who developed AKI while an in-patient compared with
those with AKI on admission (27.3 vs. 11.8%; P < 0.001). Diabetes, clinician
perception of frailty, age and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor prior to admission were found to be independent risk factors for AKI.
AKI was unrecognized in 23.5% of patients, two-thirds of whom were discharged
without resolution of renal function. Significant weaknesses in management were
poorly kept fluid balance charts (48.2%), failure to withhold nephrotoxic drugs
(38.8%) and failure to act upon abnormal biochemistry (41%) in a timely fashion.
CONCLUSION: AKI is common in hospitalized patients and associated with a
significant increase in hospital stay and mortality. AKI is often found in
conjunction with other organ failure and in many cases is not preventable.
Nevertheless clinicians need to be more vigilant of small creatinine rises to
permit early intervention particularly among elderly and frail patients.

The end-stage renal disease population is aging. Nearly half of all new patients 
are older than 65 years and one third are older than 70 years. Assessing the
possibility of transplantation for older patients with end-stage renal disease
often involves contemplating more complex issues, including cognitive impairment,
decreased functional status, and frailty, which makes selecting appropriate
candidates more difficult. Older transplant recipients have decreased patient and
transplant survival compared with younger recipients. For example, 75% of
deceased donor transplant recipients aged 30-49 years are alive after 5 years
compared to only 61% for those older than 65 years. Despite poorer outcomes
compared with younger recipients, older transplant recipients have a significant 
improvement in survival compared with similar patients who remain on the wait
list, with decreases in mortality of 41%-61% depending on the study. Use of
living donors, even older living donors, provides significantly better outcomes
for elderly recipients compared with the use of deceased donors. However, in the 
absence of a living donor, survival is improved significantly by accepting an
expanded criteria donor organ rather than waiting for a standard criteria
deceased donor. Older transplant recipients experience more infectious
complications and less acute rejection, but the risk of transplant loss from
rejection is increased compared with younger patients. These immunologic issues, 
along with the fact that older patients often are excluded from transplant
trials, have made selecting an ideal immunosuppressive regimen challenging.
Prospective comparative trials of different agents in the elderly population are 
warranted to better define the risk-benefit profile. This review discusses
transplantation outcomes, including patient and transplant survival, different
donor types, quality of life, and immunosuppression for older dialysis patients.

The present study examined the association between patient-reported anxiety and
postcardiac surgery mortality and major morbidity. Frailty Assessment Before
Cardiac Surgery was a prospective multicenter cohort study of elderly patients
undergoing cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass surgery and/or valve repair or
replacement) at 4 tertiary care hospitals from 2008 to 2009. The patients were
evaluated a mean of 2 days preoperatively with the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale, a validated questionnaire assessing depression and anxiety in
hospitalized patients. The primary predictor variable was a high level of
anxiety, defined by a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score of ≥ 11. The
main outcome measure was all-cause mortality or major morbidity (e.g., stroke,
renal failure, prolonged ventilation, deep sternal wound infection, or
reoperation) occurring during the index hospitalization. Multivariable logistic
regression analysis examined the association between high preoperative anxiety
and all-cause mortality/major morbidity, adjusting for the Society of Thoracic
Surgeons predicted risk, age, gender, and depression symptoms. A total of 148
patients (mean age 75.8 ± 4.4 years; 34% women) completed the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale. High levels of preoperative anxiety were present in 7% of
patients. No differences were found in the type of surgery and Society of
Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk across the preoperative levels of anxiety. After
adjusting for potential confounders, high preoperative anxiety was remained
independently predictive of postoperative mortality or major morbidity (odds
ratio 5.1, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 20.2; p = 0.02). In conclusion,
although high levels of anxiety were present in few patients anticipating cardiac
surgery, this conferred a strong and independent heightened risk of mortality or 
major morbidity.

Next to a high morbidity, patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) suffer
from a complex spectrum of clinical manifestations. Both the phenotype of
patients with ESRD as well as the pathophysiology of uremia show interesting
parallels with the general aging process. Phenotypically, patients with ESRD have
an increased susceptibility for both cardiovascular as well as infectious disease
and show a reduction in functional capacity as well as muscular mass
(sarcopenia), translating into a high prevalence of frailty also in younger
patients. Pathophysiologically, the immune dysfunction, telomere attrition and
the presence of low-grade inflammation in uremic patients also show parallels
with the aging process. System models of aging, such as the homeodynamic model
and reliability theory of Gavrilov may also have relevance for ESRD. The
reduction in the redundancy of compensatory mechanisms and the multisystem
impairment in ESRD explain the rapid loss of homeodynamic/homeostatic balance and
the increased susceptibility to external stressors in these patients. System
theories may also explain the relative lack of success of interventions focusing 
on single aspects of renal disease. The concept of accelerated aging, which also 
shares similarities with other organ diseases, may be of relevance both for a
better understanding of the uremic process, as well as for the design of
multidimensional interventions in ESRD patients, including an important role for 
early rehabilitation. Research into processes akin to both aging and uremia may
result in novel therapeutic approaches.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 
(KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation,
Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of
kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease
to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of
older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress
to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific
cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older
adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have
shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated 
with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis)
and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally
thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes 
include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research
studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD 
and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the
longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the
oldest old with CKD.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a physiological vulnerability status of the patient
which is associated with the increased number of hospitalization and death.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of frailty and its associated factors in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on conservative treatment (CT),
hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).
METHODS: Frailty was assessed in 146 patients (86 CT, 37 HD and 23 PD) and
characterized as muscle weakness and exhaustion--by the physical aspect and
vitality domains, respectively, evaluated in the SF-36 quality of life
instrument; physical inactivity--if he or she answered "never" or "hardly ever"
when asked about physical activity; and as unintentional weight loss (> 4.5 kg
per year). Patients were divided into three groups: non-fragile (NF), pre-fragile
(PF) and fragile (F). The demographic, clinical and laboratory data were
extracted from patient charts.
RESULTS: Frailty was diagnosed in 36% of patients on CT, 37.8% in HD and 47.8% in
PD. It was characterized in 36.8% of patients aged between 20 and 40 years and
40.3% of those between 41 and 60 years. Frailty was significantly associated with
the use of vitamin D (r = 0.16; p = 0.03), hemoglobin (r = -0.14; p = - 0.02) and
intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.16; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is common among patients with CKD on conservative treatment 
and dialysis, even in those who are not elderly. In the patients studied, the
phenotype of frailty was associated with no usage of vitamin D, lower serum
levels of hemoglobin and higher levels of parathyroid hormone.

BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and
its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we
hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between
earlier dialysis initiation and mortality.
METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis
Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident
patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for
vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization
through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the 
association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards
regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization.
RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73%.
In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with 
higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25-1.97]; P < .001) and time to first
hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45]; P < .001). While higher eGFR at
dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23]
per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically
significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the 
United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation.
Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier
initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described
association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.

Testosterone levels decrease with age. This decline is steeper during "critical
illnesses". Cardiac surgery is a particular representative model of major
clinical condition producing stress responses similar to those observed during
severe nonsurgical illness. Cardiac revascularization with extracorporeal
circulation is characterized by marked postoperative complications such as
insulin resistance, a pro-inflammatory state, acute anemia and renal dysfunction.
These phenomena are more evident in older subjects, who are particularly
vulnerable in the post-operative state, a condition that has been recently termed
as "acute postoperative frailty". We recently showed that in older men with low
ejection fraction undergoing cardiac revascularization with extracorporeal
circulation, there is a profound decline in anabolic hormones, including
testosterone. After surgery testosterone concentration frequently declines to
less than 200 ng/dl, a situation suggestive of overt hypogonadism. Since men with
low testosterone levels have a high probability of developing mobility
limitations, we considered this a rationale for the perioperative use of
testosterone treatment in older men undergoing cardiac revasularization surgery. 
We hypothesized that testosterone supplementation at this time might attenuate
the impressive post-surgical catabolic hormonal milieu. The aim of this
manuscript is to elucidate an ongoing randomized clinical trial in older men (70+
years old) undergoing elective cardiovascular revascularization with
extracorporeal circulation. This randomized clinical trial will evaluate the
effects of intramuscular testosterone administration on clinical and functional
outcomes in this population. The study will also address potential mechanisms
underlying the expected beneficial effects of testosterone supplementation
including improvement of insulin sensitivity, markers of inflammatory status and 
improved hemoglobin levels.

BACKGROUND: Organ dysfunctions and medical complications, such as renal failure, 
liver impairment, coagulation disorders, cardiovascular and respiratory
illnesses, may hamper an adequate pain management in haematological patients.
AIM: To summarize current knowledge on pain management in hematological patients 
presenting major organ dysfunctions and comorbidity. We also attempted to provide
recommendations to optimize analgesia and to minimize side effects in the setting
of medically compromised and frail haematological patients.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literature, using relevant key words, was
conducted in PubMed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Pain in hematological patients is a common symptom and
is often multi-factorial. Most pharmacotherapeutic measures, including causal
therapies, analgesics and adjuvant agents routinely applied in pain management,
may also be used in the setting of clinical frailty and medical comorbidities;
however, comprehensive clinical and functional patient's evaluations and a
careful consideration of expected benefits and potential adverse events are
required.

Older patients on dialysis have unique needs and characteristics and their
outcomes vary from that of their younger counterparts. Comparatively fewer will
start or be maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to younger patients, 
despite the fact that hemodialysis is often poorly tolerated. Barriers to PD for 
older patients include poor vision, frailty, cognitive dysfunction, accommodation
issues, and a bias from renal teams that older patients cannot do PD. The
development of assisted PD can overcome many of these barriers. The ability of
older patients to use PD as their dialysis modality should not be determined by
whether they live in an area where the nephrologist is a PD enthusiast. All
patients should be given nonbiased information so they can choose the dialysis
modality that gives them the best quality of life and suits their and their
family's lifestyle.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has a
positive predictive value for postoperative delirium (POD) after vascular
surgery.
METHODS: Between March and August 2010, 142 consecutive vascular surgery patients
were prospectively evaluated. Preoperatively, the GFI was obtained and
postoperatively patients were screened with the Delirium Observation Scale (DOS).
Patients with a DOS-score ≥3 points were assessed by a geriatrician. Delirium was
defined by the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Primary outcome variable was the incidence of 
POD. Secondary outcome variables were any surgical complication and hospital
length of stay (HLOS) (>7 days).
RESULTS: Ten patients (7%) developed POD. The highest incidence of POD was found 
after aortic surgery (17%) and amputation procedures (40%). Increased
comorbidities (p = 0.006), GFI score (p = 0.03), renal insufficiency (p = 0.04), 
elevated C-reactive protein (p = 0.008), high American Society of
Anaesthesiologists score (p = 0.05), a DOS-score of ≥3 points (p = 0.001),
post-operative intensive care unit admittance (p = 0.01) and HLOS ≥7 days (p =
0.005) were risk factors for POD. The GFI score was not associated with a
prolonged HLOS. A mean number of 2 ± 1 (range 0-5) complications were registered.
The receiver operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve for the GFI was 
0.70.
CONCLUSIONS: The GFI can be helpful in the early identification of POD after
vascular surgery in a select group of high-risk patients.

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries and 
its incidence and severity is greater among older patients. So, because of the
ageing of the population, clinicians will be increasingly confronted in daily
practice with managing acute coronary syndrome in extreme old age and high-risk
patients. Despite this demographic reality, several large randomized controlled
trials evaluating the benefit-risk ratio of invasive versus conservative approach
have systematically excluded elderly patients. The extrapolation of
evidence-based medicine, initially focused on younger patients, is often
contentious in this population and because of the lack of clear and specific
recommendations in the elderly, the optimal management of STEMI in octogenarians 
remains a topic of debate. Elderly patients present unique issues related to the 
ageing process and multiple comorbid diseases making difficult the extrapolation 
of evidence obtained on younger demographics. Data from registries seem to
support, nevertheless, the benefit of primary revascularization by PCI of the
culprit lesion in "selected" octogenarians with a high technical success rate,
few complications, acceptable short and long-term mortality rate and quality of
life. Obviously, the "ideal octogenarian" doesn't exist and all the old patients 
are not suitable for an invasive approach. Managing elderly patients requires not
only cardiological skills but also geriatric acknowledges and the individualized 
geriatric assessment is the corner store of the decision process. The aim is to
screen for the presence of comorbidities (cognitive disorders, functional
decline, anemia, renal insufficiency…), social isolation and existence of an
underlying frailty. To conclude, the optimal strategy for the management of STEMI
in octogenarians is not univocal: the best approach is the one that offers the
greater benefits regard considerations of general health.

Nephrologists care for an increasing number of elderly patients on hemodialysis. 
As such, an understanding of the overlap among complications of hemodialysis and 
geriatric syndromes is crucial. This article reviews hemodialysis management
issues including vascular access, hypertension, anemia and bone and mineral
disorders with an attention towards the distinct medical needs of the elderly.
Key concepts of geriatrics frailty, dementia and palliative care are also
discussed, as nephrologists frequently participate in decision-making directed
toward balancing longevity, functional status and the burden of therapy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney
disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated
criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to 
determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were
associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the
association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly
increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for
the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds 
of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation,
vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and
chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney
disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.
Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection
remain elusive.

Already from its early decades, peritoneal dialysis (PD) has proved to be
efficient and able to confer similar or better chronic patient survival in
comparison with hemodialysis (HD). More recent years allowed many PD therapy
advances with further outcomes improvement: mortality, hospitalizations and
clinical complications all have been reduced across patient's vintages. Adequacy 
parameters of PD also compare advantageously with the erroneously named
'high-efficiency' HD which is now facing the limitations of intermittent
procedures, frailty of KT/V as measure of adequacy, importance of sustained fluid
removal and time of dialysis. Adequacy should also include life satisfaction and 
PD also compares favorably as a home therapy. The best approach, also the most
intelligent and cost-effective, would be not to underestimate a different
therapy, but discover how complementary it can be for success of long term
patient treatment.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Eclat survey was to evaluate the frequency of frailty
in uncontrolled hypertensives and to individualize different frailty profiles.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an observational, prospective, longitudinal survey
conducted in the cohort of uncontrolled hypertensive patients aged 55 years or
more. Morbid events having occurred between two visits at a 6-month interval were
reported. Patients with at least one event were considered to be frail.
Predictive factors of at least one event were identified (logistic regression).
The analysis was completed by a typological analysis (principal components
analysis and clustering).
RESULTS: At least one event occurred in 211 (9%) of 2306 patients (males 55%,
67+/-9 years old, blood pressure [BP]=160+/-11/93+/-8 mmHg, diabetes 23%):
cardiovascular (1.7%), gerontological (5.5%), onset of diabetes (1.3%), worsening
of renal impact (2%). Three frailty profiles were identified: patients at low
risk (n=1507, event rate=6%), with neither cardiovascular risk factors nor target
organ damage; patients at moderate risk (n=335, event rate=12%) with numerous
risk factors but no target organ damage and patients at high risk (n=243, event
rate=23%), the older ones, in bad general condition, with target organ damage,
sensorial deficits and cognitive disorders. In a population of uncontrolled
hypertensives aged 55 years or more, 9% could be considered as frailty.
CONCLUSION: Therapeutic measures might be adapted according to the frailty
profile of the patient. With respect to treatment management, healthcare
behaviour could differ depending on these frailty profiles.

BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease is the most frequent hereditary disease in
Brazil, and people with the disease may be hospitalised several times in the
course of their lives. The purpose of this study was to estimate the hazard
ratios of factors associated with the time between hospital admissions.
METHODS: The study sample comprised all patients admitted, from 2000 to 2004, to 
a university hospital in Rio de Janeiro State, south-east Brazil, as a result of 
acute complications from sickle cell disease (SCD). Considering the statistical
problem of studying individuals with multiple events over time, the following
extensions of Cox's proportional hazard ratio model were compared: the
independent increment marginal model (Andersen-Gill) and the random effects
model.
RESULTS: The study considered 71 patients, who were admitted 223 times for acute 
events related to SCD. The hazard ratios for hospital readmission were
statistically significant for the prior occurrence of vaso-occlusive crisis and
development of renal failure. However, analysis of residuals of the marginal
model revealed evidence of non-proportionality for some covariates.
CONCLUSION: the results from applying the two models were generally similar,
indicating that the findings are not highly sensitive to different approaches.
The better fit by the frailty model suggests that there are unmeasured individual
factors with impact on hospital readmission.

[Physiopathology of the diabetic foot].

Diabetic foot ulcerations result from different physiopathological mechanisms; a 
clear understanding of them is crucial to reduce their incidence, provide early
care, and finally delay the amputation risk. The three main diabetes
complications involved in foot ulcerations are neuropathy, peripheral arterial
disease, and infection. The most common pathway to ulceration is peripheral
sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy, leading to loss of sensitivity, foot
deformities, high foot pressure, and dry skin. Peripheral arterial disease is
more frequent and more serious in the diabetic population. It delays
cicatrization and causes gangrene and finally amputation. Infection is also a
major complication of ulceration because of its risk of spreading into deep
tissue and bone, which increases the risk of amputation. Infection may also
generalize and become life-threatening. These complications preferentially affect
the foot because it is exposed to hyper pressure, neuropathy, and peripheral
arterial disease, which cause distal lesions, and the foot is exposed to a closed
atmosphere, a source of soaking and skin frailty. Diabetes itself may enhance the
risk of complications stemming from the disease's long-term progression and poor 
glucose control, thereby affecting ocular and renal functions. Finally, some
psychosocial situations such as depression syndrome or poor hygiene possibly
enhance diabetic foot occurrence.

Anemia signifies an underlying disease and is associated with poor clinical
outcomes. In elderly patients, in whom anemia has a high prevalence (greater than
10 percent), neither the hemoglobin threshold for concern nor the identity of the
anemia-causing disease is easily established. This is an important shortfall,
because even mild anemia can compromise patient well-being and survival,
regardless of the underlying cause. This review discusses definitions of "normal"
hemoglobin levels in adults, common causes of anemia in people aged 65 years and 
older (eg, nutritional deficiency, renal insufficiency, inflammatory disorders,
and myelodysplastic syndrome), and potential consequences of anemia in elderly
patients (eg, poorer cognitive status, increased frailty, and an elevated risk of
hospitalization and of complications during hospitalization). We also outline a
practical initial diagnostic approach that helps determine appropriate treatment,
and we weigh therapeutic options in light of new safety concerns regarding
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

New advances in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) change the
perspective from which many of its features and treatment are viewed. Calcium,
phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D have been shown to be
important determinants of survival associated with kidney diseases. Now ROD
dependent and independent of these factors is linked to survival more than just
skeletal frailty. This review focuses on recent discoveries that renal injury
impairs skeletal anabolism decreasing the osteoblast compartment of the skeleton 
and consequent bone formation. This discovery and the discovery that PTH
regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche alters our view of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) from that of a disease to
that of a necessary adaptation to renal injury that goes awry. Furthermore, ROD
is shown to be an underappreciated factor in the level of the serum phosphorus in
CKD. The discovery and the elucidation of the mechanism of hyperphosphatemia as a
cardiovascular risk in CKD change the view of ROD. It is now recognized as more
than a skeletal disorder, it is an important component of the mortality of CKD
that can be treated.

A gradual diminution in the physiologic reserve or functional capacity over time 
is the characteristic hallmark of aging, and this has a direct impact on the
choice of cancer therapy and its toxicity profile in elderly patients with
cancer. With the expected rapid rise of the older population as a subgroup,
oncologists will increasingly treat elderly patients. Provision of competent care
to this increasing pool of older patients with cancer necessitates that oncology 
professionals become familiar with age-associated changes in organ physiology and
their impact on cancer treatment and toxicity. In this comprehensive review, we
have listed changes in cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and renal
physiology with aging. Also enumerated is the impact of these changes on cancer
therapy and toxicity in each organ system-based section. Cardiovascular changes
primarily lead to reduction of the cardiac functional reserve, with a consequent 
increase in the risk of congestive heart failure. Changes in gastrointestinal
physiology lead to increased mucosal damage. A reduction in pulmonary reserve has
implications for postradiation complications, and a decline in renal function
leads to an increased potential for nephrotoxicity. These changes impair the
ability of older patients with cancer to tolerate cancer therapy and increase
their risk of toxicities. This may lead to an overall decline in functional
status, resulting frailty, poor quality of life, and ultimately poor outcomes.
Becoming familiar with age-related physiologic changes is the first step for
oncologists seeking to better tailor their treatments. This, combined with
adoption of some of the clinical interventions suggested in this review, can help
better manage the geriatric oncology patient. Further research is necessary for
the development of more specific evidence-based recommendations.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of functional disability in the
elderly. Pain and loss of motion induce a vicious circle, leading to instability,
frailty and ultimately invalidity. Currently, there is no treatment to reverse or
slow the disease progression to a clinically meaningful extent. Thus, the primary
goal of OA treatment in the elderly is pain relief and preservation of joint
function. For this, pharmacological, non-pharmacological and if necessary
surgical treatment regimes must form an integrated concept. However, the real
challenge is polymorbidity and other age-related or age-associated factors, which
influence the course of disease and its therapy unfavorably. The changes in
pharmacokinetics and -dynamics in the elderly can be compensated for the
nonopioid and opioid-analgesics by the well known "start low, go slow" approach. 
More problematic are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are
most often used for symptomatic treatment of OA: Patients over 65 have an
enhanced susceptibility to the gastrointestinal and renal side effects of NSAIDs;
all NSAIDs, not only coxibs, increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with
such a disease; number and severity of drug interactions is elevated due to
age-associated polypharmacy. Thus, NSAIDs, including coxibs, should be used with 
great caution for treatment of OA in the elderly.

Survival differences among older dialysis patients in the southeast.

GA.

Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic dialysis have
higher mortality in the United States than in many other countries. While
increasing age, white race, male sex, and/or diabetes are considered risk factors
for survival, few studies of older dialysis patients have simultaneously
considered multiple predictor variables and their interactions. Using information
contained in the 1982 to 1986 ESRD Network 20 database for Georgia and South
Carolina, we studied hospitalizations and survival of 1,354 blacks and 965 whites
who were age 60 years or older when they began dialysis therapy. Survival time
was modeled using the Cox life-table regression method. Older blacks' median age 
at dialysis initiation was 67.4, compared with 68.7 for older whites (P = 0.001).
Blacks were more likely than whites (P < 0.001) to have hypertension-related or
diabetes-related ESRD. White patients experienced approximately 25% more
hospitalization when adjustment was made for patient-days at risk. Separate
multivariate survival models were required for patients with diabetes-related
versus non-diabetes-related ESRD. Among diabetics, mortality was higher among
whites and among patients who were older when they began dialysis. Among patients
with non-diabetes-related ESRD, mortality was higher among patients who were
older when they began dialysis, but the age effect was much stronger for white
males. Our hospitalization and mortality data support the view that unmeasured
severity (or frailty) differences characterize white as compared with black
dialysis patients. Among non-diabetes-related ESRD patients, the age effect on
survival was more severe in white males than in blacks or in white females. The
high mortality we observed among older dialysis patients in Georgia and South
Carolina warrants further study; the data may in part reflect patients' lower
socioeconomic status compared with age, race, and sex-matched controls.

[Development of "mixed connective tissue disease" (MCTD) from discoid lupus
erythematosus].

[Article in German]

Bauer R, Schultz-Ehrenburg U, Orfanos CE.

A patient with discoid lupus erythematosus is reported which turned into a mixed 
connective tissue disease (MCTD) within five months. THe patient developed a
severe polysymptomatic clinical picture with frailty, myositis, generalized
erythema and livedo racemosa features, but without renal involvement. Combined
therapy with prednisolone and azathioprine led to rapid regression of all
symptoms. After releasing from the hospital a mitigated relapse could be
controlled by increasing the dose of cortico-steroids. No other relapse occurred 
during the following year. Since the onset of disease the indirect
immunofluorescence showed antinuclear antibodies of the speckled pattern. Also we
could mark antibodies against ENA. We regard this finding as an indication, that 
in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus and antinuclear antibodies of the
speckled pattern the risk of progressing into MCTD had to be considered. Repeated
controls for symptoms of other collagenoses, therefore, should follow for a
period of two years.
