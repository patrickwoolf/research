Sarcopenia and frailty are recognized as key risk factors for adverse outcomes in
patients on renal replacement therapy or with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease
(CKD). However, there is still debate about their pathogenesis and, thus, about
the best therapeutic approaches, as well as the impact on outcomes of current
approaches based on different exercise programmes. In the past two issues of
Clinical Kidney Journal, several manuscripts address the issue of sarcopenia in
CKD from the point of view of pathogenesis and new therapeutic approaches,
monitoring of results, implementation of exercise programmes and specific
potential benefits of exercise programmes in dialysis and non-dialysis CKD
patients, as assessed by clinical trials.

Diabetes mellitus affects over 20% of people aged > 65 years. With the population
of older people living with diabetes growing, the condition may be only one of a 
number of significant comorbidities that increases the complexity of their care, 
reduces functional status and inhibits their ability to self-care. Coexisting
comorbidities may compete for the attention of the patient and their healthcare
team, and therapies to manage comorbidities may adversely affect a person's
diabetes. The presence of renal or liver disease reduces the types of
antihyperglycemic therapies available for use. As a result, insulin and
sulfonylurea-based therapies may have to be used, but with caution. There may be 
a growing role for sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in
diabetic renal disease and for glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 therapy in renal and
liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). Cancer treatments pose considerable
challenges in glucose therapy, especially the use of cyclical chemotherapy or
glucocorticoids, and cyclical antihyperglycemic regimens may be required.
Clinical trials of glucose lowering show reductions in microvascular and, to a
lesser extent, cardiovascular complications of diabetes, but these benefits take 
many years to accrue, and evidence specifically in older people is lacking.
Guidelines recognize that clinicians managing patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus need to be mindful of comorbidity, particularly the risks of
hypoglycemia, and ensure that patient-centered therapeutic management of diabetes
is offered. Targets for glucose control need to be carefully considered in the
context of comorbidity, life expectancy, quality of life, and patient wishes and 
expectations. This review discusses the role of chronic kidney disease, chronic
liver disease, cancer, severe mental illness, ischemic heart disease, and frailty
as comorbidities in the therapeutic management of hyperglycemia in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Management of hypoglycemia in older adults with type 2 diabetes.

Treatment of older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is complex because they
represent a heterogeneous group with a broad range of comorbidities, functional
abilities, socioeconomic status, and life expectancy. Older adults with T2D are
at high risk of recurring hypoglycemia, a condition associated with marked
morbidity and mortality, because their counter-regulatory mechanism to
hypoglycemia is attenuated, and recurring hypoglycemic episodes can lead to
hypoglycemia unawareness. In addition, polypharmacy, a result of multiple chronic
comorbidities (including heart disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease), can 
increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia, especially when patients are taking
sulfonylureas or insulin. Often the signs of hypoglycemia are nonspecific
(sweating, dizziness, confusion, visual disturbances) and are mistaken for
neurological symptoms or dementia. Consequences of hypoglycemia include acute and
long-term cognitive changes, cardiac arrhythmia and myocardial infarction,
serious falls, frailty, and death, often resulting in hospitalization, which come
at a high economic cost. The American Diabetes Association has recently added
three new recommendations regarding hypoglycemia in the elderly, highlighting
individualized pharmacotherapy with glucose-lowering agents with a low risk of
hypoglycemia and proven cardiovascular safety, avoidance of overtreatment, and
simplifying treatment regimens while maintaining HbA1c targets. Thus, glycemic
goals can be relaxed in the older population as part of individualized care, and 
physicians must make treatment decisions that best serve their patients'
circumstances. This article highlights the issues faced by older people with T2D,
the risk factors for hypoglycemia in this population, and the challenges faced by
health care providers regarding glycemic management in this patient group.

INTRODUCTION: People living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART)
experience high rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These co-morbidities
often accumulate and older adults may suffer from multimorbidity. Multimorbidity 
has been associated with loss of quality of life, polypharmacy, and increased
risk of frailty and mortality. Little is known of the trends or predictors NCD
multimorbidity in PLHIV in low- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: We examined NCD multimorbidity in adult PLHIV initiating ART between
2003 and 2014 using a multi-site, observational cohort in Brazil. NCDs included
cardiovascular artery disease, hyperlipidemia (HLD), diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, cirrhosis, osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, venous thromboembolism and
non-AIDS-defining cancers. Multimorbidity was defined as the incident
accumulation of two or more unique NCDs. We used Poisson regression to examine
trends and Cox proportional hazard models to examine predictors of
multimorbidity.
RESULTS: Of the 6206 adults, 332 (5%) developed multimorbidity during the study
period. Parallel to the ageing of the cohort, the prevalence of multimorbidity
rose from 3% to 11% during the study period. Older age, female sex (adjusted
hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.65)) and low
CD4 nadir (<100 vs. ≥200 cells/mm3 aHR = 1.52 (95% CI: 1.15 to 2.01)) at cohort
entry were significantly associated with increased risk of multimorbidity. Among 
patients with incident multimorbidity, the most common NCDs were HLD and
diabetes; however, osteoporosis was also frequent in women (16 vs. 35% of men and
women with multimorbidity respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Among adult PLHIV in Brazil, NCD multimorbidity increased from 2003 
to 2014. Females and adults with low CD4 nadir were at increased risk in adjusted
analyses. Further studies examining prevention, screening and management of NCDs 
in PLHIV in low- and middle-income countries are needed.

Advanced age is one of the major determinants of frailty in patients with
cancer-associated thrombosis. However, multiple other factors contribute to
frailty in these patients. The identification of frailty in patients with
cancer-associated thrombosis is critical as it influences the complexity of the
anticoagulant treatment in this population at high risk of venous thromboembolism
and bleeding. Factors that contribute to frailty in patients with
cancer-associated thrombosis include age, type of cancer, comorbidities such as
chronic kidney disease, poly-pharmacotherapy, treatment compliance, cognitive
impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mobility, nutritional status, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group grade, risk of falls, and reduced life expectancy. In 
the absence of specific clinical studies current anticoagulant treatment
guidelines for the management are not fully applicable to frail patients with
cancer. The anticoagulant treatment should therefore benefit from a tailored
approach based on an algorithm that takes into account the specificities of the
malignant disease.

There is interdependence between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ageing whereby 
CKD makes ageing more accelerated and pronounced, whereas ageing accelerates
chronic nephropathy's progression. Frailty status catalyzes this spiral, with
renal and systemic negative consequences, and this condition can currently be
documented by applying already validated clinical scores (frailty phenotype) or
physical test (gate speed). Although, nephroprevention strategies are similar
between young adult and senior CKD patients, standard targets should be adequate 
to very old and frail elderly individuals. For this purpose, an original
algorithm is here proposed to adjust the conventional nephroprevention strategies
to the condition of CKD frail patient (more relaxed targets and tighter control),
as well as to prescribe anti-frailty interventions to slow patient's functional
decline, hospitalization and mortality.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frail patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an
increased hospitalisation and mortality rate. However, many popular frailty
screening methods have not been validated in patients with CKD. This study
evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of several frailty screening methods in
patients with CKD G4-5 and those established on haemodialysis (G5D).
METHODS: Ninety participants with CKD G4-5D were recruited from Nephrology
Outpatient Clinics and 2 Haemodialysis Units between December 2016 and December
2017. Frailty was diagnosed using the Fried Frailty Phenotype. The following
frailty screening tests were evaluated: Clinical Frailty Scale, PRISMA-7, CKD
Frailty Index, CKD FI-LAB, walking speed, hand grip strength and Short Physical
Performance Battery.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 69 years (SD ±13). One-third of
participants were dialysis-dependent. Nineteen (21%) patients were categorised as
frail, 42 (47%) as pre-frail and 29 (32%) as robust. Overall, walking speed was
the most discriminative measure (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.93-1.00], sensitivity 0.84
[95% CI 0.62-0.94], specificity 0.96 [95% CI 0.88-0.99]). The Clinical Frailty
Scale had the best performance of the non-physical assessment frailty screening
methods (AUC 0.90 [95% CI 0.84-0.97], sensitivity 0.79 [95% CI 0.57-0.91],
specificity 0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.93]).
CONCLUSIONS: Walking speed can be used to accurately screen for frailty in CKD
populations. If it is not practical to perform a physical assessment to screen
for frailty, the Clinical Frailty Scale is a useful alternative.

Early outcomes of cardiac surgery in elderly patients.

Mzoughi K, Zairi I, Daly M, Ziadi J, Kamoun S, Ben Moussa F, Fennira S, Kraiem S.

BACKGROUND: Due to the increase in average life expectancy and the higher
incidence of cardiovascular disease, more elderly patients present for cardiac
surgery nowadays. At the same time, age has been considered a predictor of
morbidity and mortality.
AIM: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of cardiac surgery in elderly patients.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive retrospective study including elderly
patients who underwent cardiac surgery from January 2012 to 31st of December
2016. All patients were hospitalized before and after cardiac surgery in the
cardiology department of Habib Thameur Hospital.
RESULTS: Our study included 55 patients. Average age was 72±6 years old and
sex-ratio was two. Eighty-five percent presented with angina, 18% with dyspnea
and one patient with an aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis. Mean left
ventricular function was 54 ±9 %. Mean EuroSCORE II was 1.91±1.18. Twenty-six
per-cent had an urgent surgery. Mean extracorporeal circulation time was of 77±26
min and mean extubation time was 8±6 h. Eighty-four per cent had a coronary
artery bybass grafting and 16% a valve replacement. Four per cent had a redux and
4% a combined surgery. Stay in surgical department varied between 3 and 10 days
with average of 4.6±1.2 days. Early mortality rate was of 2% and 98% had
complications. Ninety-eight complications occurred after surgery: 35
reintervention for mediastinal bleeding or tamponade, 28 bleedings requiring
transfusions, eight heart rhythm disorders, an atrioventricular conduction block 
requiring ventricular, five atrial fibrillation, two ventricular tachycardias, a 
ventricular fibrillation, eight low cardiac outpout, seven prolonged mechanical
ventilation and eight pneumonias. In univariate analysis, recent myocardial
infarction and chronic kidney disease were predictive of early complications.
CONCLUSION: Our data shows cardiac surgery is feasible in elderly patients with
acceptable risk in terms of mortality and an increased morbidity due to their
frailty. Careful patient selection is needed for the success of cardiac surgery
in elderly patients.

AIM: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been
diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty,
but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with
frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study
to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic
hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited.
Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered
diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not
(Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the
prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined
the risk factors for frailty.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than 
that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the
association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients
(n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their
interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic
nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty.

nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18:

BACKGROUND: Decline of renal function is common in older persons and the
prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising with ageing. CKD affects
different outcomes relevant to older persons, additionally to morbidity and
mortality which makes CKD a relevant health burden in this population. Still,
accurate laboratory measurement of kidney function is under debate, since current
creatinine-based equations have a certain degree of inaccuracy when used in the
older population. The aims of the study are as follows: to assess kidney function
in a cohort of 75+ older persons using existing methodologies for CKD screening; 
to investigate existing and innovative biomarkers of CKD in this cohort, and to
align laboratory and biomarker results with medical and functional data obtained 
from this cohort. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier
NCT02691546, February 25th 2016.
METHODS/DESIGN: An observational, multinational, multicenter, prospective cohort 
study in community dwelling persons aged 75 years and over, visiting the
outpatient clinics of participating institutions. The study will enroll 2450
participants and is carried out in Austria, Germany, Israel, Italy, the
Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Participants will undergo clinical and laboratory 
evaluations at baseline and after 12 and 24 months- follow-up. Clinical
evaluation also includes a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Local
laboratory will be used for 'basic' parameters (including serum creatinine and
albumin-to-creatinine ratio), whereas biomarker assessment will be conducted
centrally. An intermediate telephone follow-up will be carried out at 6 and
18 months.
DISCUSSION: Combining the use of CGA and the investigation of novel and existing 
independent biomarkers within the SCOPE study will help to provide evidence in
the development of European guidelines and recommendations in the screening and
management of CKD in older people.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered prospectively on the 25th February 
2016 at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT02691546 ).

Under normal conditions, inflammation is a protective and physiological response 
to various harmful stimuli. However, in several chronic debilitating disorders,
such as chronic kidney disease, inflammation becomes maladaptive, uncontrolled
and persistent. Systemic persistent inflammation has, for almost 20 years, been
recognized as a major contributor to the uraemic phenotype (such as
cardiovascular disease, protein energy wasting, depression, osteoporosis and
frailty), and a predictor of cardiovascular and total mortality. Since
inflammation is mechanistically related to several ageing processes
(inflammageing), it may be a major driver of a progeric phenotype in the uraemic 
milieu. Inflammation is likely the consequence of a multifactorial aetiology and 
interacts with a number of factors that emerge when uraemic toxins accumulate.
Beside interventions aiming to decrease the production of inflammatory molecules 
in the uraemic milieu, novel strategies to increase the removal of large middle
molecules, such as expanded haemodialysis, may be an opportunity to decrease the 
inflammatory allostatic load associated with retention of middle molecular weight
uraemic toxins.

The burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) is projected to increase substantially
over the next decade in parallel with the aging of the population. The increasing
age, level of comorbidity, and polypharmacy will complicate the treatment of
older adults with AF. For instance, advanced age and chronic kidney disease have 
been shown to increase the risk of both thromboembolism and bleeding in patients 
with AF. Frailty, recurrent falls and polypharmacy, while very common among
elderly patients with AF, are often overlooked in the clinical decision making
despite their significant interaction with oral anticoagulant (OAC) and profound 
impact on the patient's clinical outcomes. Such factors should be recognized,
evaluated and considered in a comprehensive decision-making process. The
introduction of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants has radically changed the
management of AF allowing for a more individualized selection of OAC. An
understanding of the available data regarding the performance of each of the
available OAC in a variety of at risk patient populations is paramount for the
safe and effective management of this patient population. The aim of this review 
is to appraise the current evidence, point out the gaps in knowledge, and provide
recommendations regarding stroke prevention in older adults with AF and comorbid 
conditions.

In the case of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), physicians are facing more
and more difficulties in managing VTE and their treatment in frail patients.
These patients could present several risk situations such as: chronic kidney
disease (CKD), underweight or malnourished, falls, cognitive impairment,
multi-medicated patients, cancer and pregnancy. Guidelines typically recommend
anticoagulation. There are multiple challenges in the safe use of anticoagulation
in frail patients, including bleeding risk, monitoring and adherence, and
polypharmacy. The objective of this review is to explore these at-risk situations
and to suggest adequate anticoagulation therapy, when possible, in each of these 
complex situations.

BACKGROUND: Patients on dialysis are physically inactive, with most reporting
activity levels below the fifth percentile of healthy age-matched groups. Several
small studies have reported efficacy of diverse exercise interventions among
persons with CKD and those on dialysis. However, no single intervention has been 
widely adopted in real-world practice, despite a clear need in this vulnerable
population with high rates of mortality, frailty, and skilled nursing
hospitalizations.
METHODS/DESIGN: We describe a pragmatic clinical trial for an exercise
intervention among patients transitioning to dialysis. We will use an existing
framework - Exercise is Medicine (EIM) - developed by the American College of
Sports Medicine. After undertaking formative qualitative research to tailor the
EIM framework to the advanced CKD population (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m2), we will
randomize 96 patients from two regions-Atlanta and Bay Area-in two intervention
arms with incremental levels of clinical-community integration: physical activity
assessment during Nephrology clinical visit, brief counseling at pre-dialysis
education, and physical activity wearable (group 1) versus group 1 intervention
components plus a referral to a free, EIM practitioner-led group exercise program
over 16 weeks (group 2; 8 week core intervention; 8-week follow up). We will
assess efficacy by comparing between group differences in minutes/week of
objectively measured moderate intensity physical activity. To evaluate
implementation, we will use questionnaires for assessing barriers to referral,
participation and retention along the path of the intervention. Further we will
have a plan for dissemination of the intervention by partnering with relevant
stakeholders.
DISCUSSION: The overall goal is to inform the development of a practical,
cost-conscious intervention "package" that addresses barriers and challenges to
physical activity commonly faced by patients with advanced CKD and can be
disseminated amongst interested practices.

The decision about when to start dialysis for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is 
complex and is influenced by many factors. ESKD-related symptoms and signs are
the most common indications for dialysis initiation. Creatinine-based formulae to
estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are inaccurate in patients with ESKD
and, thus, the decision to start dialysis should not be based solely on estimated
GFR (eGFR). Early dialysis initiation (ie, at an eGFR > 10 mL/min/1.73
m<sup>2</sup>) is not associated with a morbidity and mortality benefit, as shown
in the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) study. This observation has
been incorporated into the latest guidelines, which place greater emphasis on the
assessment of patients' symptoms and signs rather than eGFR. It is suggested that
in asymptomatic patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease, dialysis may be
safely delayed until the eGFR is at least as low as 5-7 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>
if there is careful clinical follow-up and adequate patient education. The
decision on when to start dialysis is even more challenging in older patients.
Due to their comorbidities and frailty, dialysis initiation may be associated
with worse outcomes and quality of life. Therefore, the decision to start
dialysis in these patients should be carefully weighed against its risks, and
conservative care should be considered in appropriate cases. To optimise the
decision-making process for dialysis initiation, patients need to be referred to 
a nephrologist in a timely fashion to allow adequate pre-dialysis care and
planning. Dialysis initiation and its timing should be a shared decision between 
physician, patients and family members, and should be tailored to the individual 
patient's needs.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence is reported to be 10 times higher
in aged people. Related to their higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease
(CKD), older patients are at high risk of toxic effects driven by drugs.
METHODS: The demographics, hospitalizations, visits to the Emergency Department, 
pharmacological therapy, and lab tests were analyzed in 71,588 individuals.
RESULTS: Data showed a higher prevalence of AKI as well as CKD in the elderly as 
compared to the younger group, with an associated very high mortality. A broad
number of drugs was prescribed, ranging from 1 to 35, the majority being between 
5 and 9 drugs.
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients who developed AKI had a higher number of
hospitalizations (underlying frailty), were more likely to progress to more
severe stages of CKD and to be affected by other non-renal pathologies
(associated comorbidities) and to be given heavier pharmacological prescriptions 
(polypharmacy).

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects 10%-15% of the population, associates
with a range of complications-such as cardiovascular disease, frailty,
infections, muscle and bone disorders and premature ageing-that could be related 
to alterations of mitochondrial number, distribution, structure and function. As 
mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetics and the dynamic mitochondrial networks
directly or indirectly regulate numerous intra- and extracellular functions, the 
mitochondria have emerged as an important target for interventions aiming at
preventing or improving the treatment of complications in CKD. In this review, we
discuss the possible role of bioactive food compounds and exercise in the
modulation of the disturbed mitochondrial function in a uraemic milieu.

OBJECTIVES: Frailty can cause increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes,
such as falls, fractures, depression and reduced health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition,
HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care
utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 
2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5).
METHODS: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney
disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up
study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale);
depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and
cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools.
Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights >136 kg, and coinciding
comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded.
RESULTS: Frailty occurred in 17% of participants (n=7). Frail participants had
lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more 
depression (p=<0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and
emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p<0.05). No differences in
health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail
participants (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney
disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater
depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.

BACKGROUND: We retrospectively assessed the initial clinical role of preoperative
frailty in surgical patients with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD).
METHODS: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients who underwent emergent or 
urgent surgical interventions for AAAD in our institute between April 2000 and
March 2016 participated in this retrospective study. Patients with more than
three of the following six modalities were defined as being frail: age older than
75 years, preoperative requirement of assistance in daily living, body mass index
less than 18.5 kg/m2, female, history of major stroke, and chronic kidney disease
greater than class 3b. Twenty-three patients (20.2%) were diagnosed with frailty 
(group F), while 91 patients (79.8%) were not (group N). Early clinical outcomes,
major postoperative complications, postoperative recovery of activity, and early 
or mid-term survival were evaluated.
RESULTS: Although early clinical outcomes and the prevalence of major
postoperative complications were similar in both groups, postoperative activity
of daily living (ADL), such as the rate of being ambulatory on discharge
(p < 0.05) and home discharge (p < 0.01), was significantly lower in group F than
in group N. A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 1- and 5-year survival rates
were similar in groups F (85.9 and 76.4%, respectively) and N (86.0 and 76.9%,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative frailty in AAAD surgical patients has potential as a
prognostic factor that affects delays in ADL recovery, but does not influence the
early or mid-term clinical outcomes of prompt surgical strategies for life rescue
in AAAD patients with frailty.

Aging is an important risk factor for patients with atrial fibrillation. The
estimated prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients aged ≥80 years is 9-10%, 
and is associated with a four to five fold increased risk of embolic stroke, and 
with an estimated increased stroke risk of 1.45-fold per decade in aging. Older
age is also associated with an increased risk of major bleeding with oral
anticoagulant therapy. This review will focus on the role of oral anticoagulation
with new oral anticoagulants, non-vitamin K antagonist in populations with common
comorbid conditions, including age, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery
disease, on multiple medication, and frailty. In patients 75 years and older,
randomised trials have shown new oral anticoagulants to be as effective as
warfarin, or in some cases superior, with an overall better safety profile,
consistently reducing rates of intracranial haemorrhages. Prior to considering
oral anticoagulant therapy in an elderly frail patient, a comprehensive
assessment should be performed to include the risks and benefits, stroke risk,
baseline kidney function, cognitive status, mobility and fall risk, multiple
medication, nutritional status assessment, and life expectancy.

Inflammageing: chronic inflammation in ageing, cardiovascular disease,
and frailty.

Most older individuals develop inflammageing, a condition characterized by
elevated levels of blood inflammatory markers that carries high susceptibility to
chronic morbidity, disability, frailty, and premature death. Potential mechanisms
of inflammageing include genetic susceptibility, central obesity, increased gut
permeability, changes to microbiota composition, cellular senescence, NLRP3
inflammasome activation, oxidative stress caused by dysfunctional mitochondria,
immune cell dysregulation, and chronic infections. Inflammageing is a risk factor
for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and clinical trials suggest that this
association is causal. Inflammageing is also a risk factor for chronic kidney
disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, depression, dementia, and sarcopenia, but
whether modulating inflammation beneficially affects the clinical course of
non-CVD health problems is controversial. This uncertainty is an important issue 
to address because older patients with CVD are often affected by multimorbidity
and frailty - which affect clinical manifestations, prognosis, and response to
treatment - and are associated with inflammation by mechanisms similar to those
in CVD. The hypothesis that inflammation affects CVD, multimorbidity, and frailty
by inhibiting growth factors, increasing catabolism, and interfering with
homeostatic signalling is supported by mechanistic studies but requires
confirmation in humans. Whether early modulation of inflammageing prevents or
delays the onset of cardiovascular frailty should be tested in clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: The association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and functional
status may change as a function of the equation used to estimate glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR). We reviewed the predictive value of different eGFR
equations in regard to frailty and disability outcomes.
METHODS: We searched Pubmed from inception to March 2018 for studies
investigating the association between eGFR and self-reported and/or objective
measures of frailty or disability. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were 
separately analysed.
RESULTS: We included 16 studies, one of which reporting both cross-sectional and 
longitudinal data. Three out of 7 cross-sectional studies compared different eGFR
equations in regard to their association with functional status: two studies
showed that cystatin C-based, but not creatinine-based eGFR may be associated
with hand-grip strength or frailty; another study showed that two different
creatinine-based eGFR equations may be similarly associated with disability. Four
out of 10 longitudinal studies provided comparative data: two studies reported
similar association with disability for different creatinine-based eGFR
equations; one study showed that creatinine-based eGFR was not associated with
frailty, but a not significant trend for association was observed with cystatin
C-based eGFR; one study showed that cystatin C-based but not creatinine-based
eGFR may predict incident mobility disability, while both methods may predict
gait speed decline. High heterogeneity was observed in regard to confounders
included in reviewed studies. None of them included the most recently published
equations.
CONCLUSION: Available data do not support the superiority of one of the eGFR
equations in terms of measuring or predicting functional decline.

Increases in rates of obesity in the older population are hastening the
development of chronic illnesses, including chronic kidney disease (CKD).
However, obesity reduction in older adults is besought with concerns about the
long-term benefit/risk, especially regarding loss of muscle mass and its impact
on function. Higher protein intakes have been advocated to help offset the
tendency for loss of muscle during weight reduction but this raises concerns
about possible negative effects on older kidneys. We assessed markers of renal
function in venous blood samples collected during a six-month randomized
controlled weight loss trial of higher protein intake in obese (n = 67;
BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) older (≥60 years) adults with physical frailty and age-normal
renal status (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≥ 45); the Control diet (0.8 g
protein/kg body weight/day; n = 21) was compared to a protein-enhanced (1.2 g/g
protein/kg body weight/day with 30 g protein/meal; n = 41; Protein) diet. Results
showed no group effect of the Protein treatment on markers of renal function
(estimated GFR, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine), either upon intervention
completion or one year later. Our findings align with literature support for the 
benefits of higher protein in the diets of older individuals during obesity
reduction and help to confirm the safety of moderate increases in protein intake 
during weight loss in this population.

The population undergoing dialysis is aging worldwide, particularly in Japan. The
clinical condition of frailty is the most problematic expression in the elderly
population. Potential pathophysiological factors of frailty present in patients
with CKD and are accentuated in patients with ESRD. The aim of this study was to 
identify the prevalence and predictors of frailty in Japanese HD patients. This
study was a multicenter, cross-sectional and observational investigation
conducted at 6 institutions. To evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty
phenotype adjusted for Japanese as the self-reported questionnaire was used. Of
the 542 patients visiting each institution, 388 were enrolled in this study. In
total, 26.0% of participants were categorized as not-frailty, 52.6% as
pre-frailty and 21.4% as frailty. The prevalence of frailty increased steadily
with age and was more prevalent in females than in males and the subjects with
frailty received polypharmacy. A multivariate logistic regression analysis
revealed that the factors independently associated with frailty were the
following: female gender (odds ratio [OR] = 3.661, 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.398-9.588), age (OR = 1.065, 95% CI 1.014-1.119), age ≥ 75 years old (OR =
4.892, 95% CI 1.715-13.955), body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 (OR = 0.110, 95% CI
0.0293-0.416), number of medications being taken (OR = 1.351, 95% CI
1.163-1.570), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR = 2.765, 95% CI 1.081-7.071) and MNA-SF 
≤ 11 (OR = 7.405, 95% CI 2.732-20.072). Frailty was associated with the
accumulation of risk factors. The prevalence of frailty in Japanese patients with
HD was relatively lower than that previously reported in Western developed
countries; however, it was extremely high compared to the general population
regardless of age. Our findings suggest that frailty might be associated with an 
increase in the prevalence of adverse health outcomes in patients with HD.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cognitive and renal impairment are pervasive among elderly
frails, a high-risk, geriatric sub-population with peculiar clinical
characteristics. In a series of frail individuals with non-advanced chronic
kidney disease (CKD), we aimed at assessing the entity of functional, general
health and cognitive impairment and the possible relationship between these types
of dysfunction and the severity of renal impairment.
METHODS: 2229 geriatric subjects were screened for frailty and CKD. Severity of
CKD was assessed by eGFR (CKD-EPI formula). Frailty was established by the Fried 
Index. Functional, general health and cognitive status were assessed by validated
score measures.
RESULTS: Final analysis included 271 frail CKD subjects (162 women, 109 men).
Mean eGFR was 64.25 ± 25.04 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD
(stage 3-4) was 44%. Twenty-six percent of patients had severe cognitive
impairment, while mild and moderate impairment was found in 7 and 67% of
individuals, respectively. All subjects had poor functional and general health
status. Cognitive capacities significantly decreased across CKD stages (p for
trend < 0.0001). In fully adjusted multivariate analyses, cognitive status
remained an independent predictor of eGFR (β = 0.465; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mild-to-moderate CKD is highly pervasive among frail elderly
individuals and the severity of renal dysfunction is independently correlated
with that of cognitive impairment. Future studies are advocated to clarify
whether the combination of kidney and mental dysfunction may portend a higher
risk of worsen outcomes in this high-risk population.

Purpose: Recent evidence supports the prognostic significance of frailty for
functional decline and poor health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney
disease. Yet, despite the development of clinical tools to screen for frailty,
little is known about the experiential impact of screening for frailty in this
setting. The Frailty Assessment for Care Planning Tool (FACT) evaluates frailty
across 4 domains: mobility, function, social circumstances, and cognition. The
purpose of this qualitative study was as follows: 1) explore the nurse experience
of screening for frailty using the FACT tool in a specialized outpatient renal
clinic; 2) determine how, if at all, provider perceptions of frailty changed
after implementation of the frailty screening tool; and 3) determine the
perceived factors that influence uptake and administration of the FACT screening 
tool in a specialized clinical setting.
Methods: A semi-structured interview of 5 nurses from the Nova Scotia Health
Authority, Central Zone Renal Clinic was conducted. A grounded theory approach
was used to generate thematic categories and analysis models.
Results: Four primary themes emerged in the data analysis: "we were skeptical",
"we made it work", "we learned how", and "we understand". As the renal nurses
gained a sense of confidence in their ability to implement the FACT tool, initial
barriers to implementation were attenuated. Implementation factors - such as
realistic goals, clear guidelines, and ongoing training - were important factors 
for successful uptake of the frailty screening initiative.
Conclusion: Nurse participants reported an overall positive experience using the 
FACT method to screen for frailty and indicated that their understanding of the
multiple dimensions and subtleties of "frailty" were enhanced. Future nurse-led
FACT screening initiatives should incorporate those factors identified as being
integral to program success: realistic goals, clear guidelines, and ongoing
training. Adopting the evaluation of frailty as a priority within clinical
departments will encourage sustainability.

Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are produced by several endogenous
and exogenous processes, and their negative effects are neutralized by
antioxidant defenses. Oxidative stress occurs from the imbalance between RONS
production and these antioxidant defenses. Aging is a process characterized by
the progressive loss of tissue and organ function. The oxidative stress theory of
aging is based on the hypothesis that age-associated functional losses are due to
the accumulation of RONS-induced damages. At the same time, oxidative stress is
involved in several age-related conditions (ie, cardiovascular diseases [CVDs],
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, neurodegenerative 
diseases, and cancer), including sarcopenia and frailty. Different types of
oxidative stress biomarkers have been identified and may provide important
information about the efficacy of the treatment, guiding the selection of the
most effective drugs/dose regimens for patients and, if particularly relevant
from a pathophysiological point of view, acting on a specific therapeutic target.
Given the important role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of many clinical
conditions and aging, antioxidant therapy could positively affect the natural
history of several diseases, but further investigation is needed to evaluate the 
real efficacy of these therapeutic interventions. The purpose of this paper is to
provide a review of literature on this complex topic of ever increasing interest.

A low-protein diet (LPD) can be expected to retard renal function decline in
advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including diabetic kidney
disease (DKD), and is recommended in a clinical setting. Regarding the molecular 
mechanisms of an LPD against DKD, previous animal studies have shown that an LPD 
exerts reno-protection through mainly the improvement of glomerular
hyperfiltration/hypertension due to the reduction of intraglomerular pressure. On
the other hand, we have demonstrated that an LPD, particularly a very-LPD (VLPD),
improved tubulo-interstitial damage, inflammation and fibrosis, through the
restoration of autophagy via the reduction of a mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in type 2 diabetes and obesity animal models. Thus,
based on animal studies, a VLPD may show a more beneficial effect against
advanced DKD. Previous clinical reports have also shown that a VLPD, not a
moderate LPD, slows the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with chronic
glomerular nephritis. However, there is insufficient clinical data regarding the 
beneficial effects of a VLPD against DKD. Additionally, the patients with CKD,
including DKD, are a high-risk group for malnutrition, such as protein⁻energy
wasting (PEW), sarcopenia, and frailty. Therefore, an LPD, including a VLPD,
should be prescribed to patients when the benefits of an LPD outweigh the risks, 
upon consideration of adherence, age, and nutritional status. As the future
predicts, the development of a VLPD replacement therapy without malnutrition may 
be expected for reno-protection against the advanced stages of DKD, through the
regulation of mTORC1 activity and adequate autophagy induction. However, further 
studies to elucidate detailed mechanisms by which a VLPD exerts reno-protection
are necessary.

Frailty, the state of increased vulnerability to physical stressors as a result
of progressive and sustained degeneration in multiple physiological systems, is
common in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In fact, the prevalence of
frailty in the older adult population is reported to be 11%, whereas the
prevalence of frailty has been reported to be greater than 60% in
dialysis-dependent CKD patients. Frailty is independently linked with adverse
clinical outcomes in all stages of CKD and has been repeatedly shown to be
associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization. In recent
years there have been efforts to create an operationalized definition of frailty 
to aid its diagnosis and to categorize its severity. Two principal concepts are
described, namely the Fried Phenotype Model of Physical Frailty and the
Cumulative Deficit Model of Frailty. There is no agreement on which frailty
assessment approach is superior, therefore, for the time being, emphasis should
be placed on any efforts to identify frailty. Recognizing frailty should prompt a
holistic assessment of the patient to address risk factors that may exacerbate
its progression and to ensure that the patient has appropriate psychological and 
social support. Adequate nutritional intake is essential and individualized
exercise programmes should be offered. The acknowledgement of frailty should
prompt discussions that explore the future care wishes of these vulnerable
patients. With further study, nephrologists may be able to use frailty
assessments to inform discussions with patients about the initiation of renal
replacement therapy.

Before the percutaneous era, the mortality rate of patients with coronary heart
disease not suitable for cardiac surgery was extremely high. This limit has been 
progressively exceeded with the advent of minimally invasive approaches, which,
although initially intended exclusively for low risk scenarios, was then employed
in complex patients often too compromised to undergo cardiac surgery. We are
currently witnessing, however, a sudden expansion in percutaneous coronary
interventions (PCI) in extreme cases, perceived as high-risk by operators,
imposing an important burden of human and economic resources on interventional
cardiology as a whole. In this review, the literature regarding the current
definition of high-risk PCI and its implications has been reviewed. In summary,
all proposed definitions of high risk PCI combine features related to three main 
clinical areas: 1) patient risk factors and comorbidities (incorporating those
which preclude surgical or percutaneous revascularization such as diabetes,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, lung disease,
frailty, advanced age); 2) location of the disease and complexity of coronary
anatomy (including multi-vessel disease, left main disease, chronic total
occlusion, bifurcations); 3) hemodynamic clinical status (ventricular
dysfunction, concomitant valvular disease or unstable characteristics).
Importantly, encouraging results in terms of efficacy and gains in health status 
of PCI in (variously defined) high-risk, as compared to the low-risks patients,
are reported. Thus, treating high-risk patients is becoming increasingly
relevant, to the point that current guidelines now particularly highlight the
appropriateness of percutaneous interventions in this setting .

OBJECTIVE: To determine predictors of serious adverse events (SAEs) involving
syncope, hypotension, and falls, with particular attention to age, in the
Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.
DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial.
SETTING: Academic and private practices across the United States (N = 102).
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 50 and older with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of
130 to 180 mmHg at high risk of cardiovascular disease events, but without
diabetes, history of stroke, symptomatic heart failure or ejection fraction less 
than 35%, dementia, or standing SBP less than 110 mmHg (N = 9,361).
INTERVENTION: Treatment of SBP to a goal of less than 120 mmHg or 140 mmHg.
MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were SAEs involving syncope, hypotension, and falls.
Predictors were treatment assignment, demographic characteristics, comorbidities,
baseline measurements, and baseline use of cardiovascular medications.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two (1.8%) participants had SAEs involving syncope, 
155 (1.6%) hypotension, and 203 (2.2%) falls. Randomization to intensive SBP
control was associated with greater risk of an SAE involving hypotension (hazard 
ratio (HR) = 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-2.32, P = .002), and
possibly syncope (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.98-1.79, P = .07), but not falls
(HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.75-1.29, P = .90). Risk of all three outcomes was higher
for participants with chronic kidney disease or frailty. Older age was also
associated with greater risk of syncope, hypotension, and falls, but there was no
age-by-treatment interaction for any of the SAE outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants randomized to intensive SBP control had greater risk of
hypotension and possibly syncope, but not falls. The greater risk of developing
these events associated with intensive treatment did not vary according to age.

Many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease have 
unmet palliative care (PC) needs. Physical and emotional symptoms are common.
Some, like uremia and fluid overload, improve with dialysis, but the increasing
age of patients initiating renal replacement therapy leaves many untreatable
comorbidities like dementia and frailty to negatively impact quality of life.
Written by nephrologists and PC clinicians, this article will help PC providers
to have a richer understanding of kidney disease-related symptom burden, disease 
trajectory, prognosis, and barriers to hospice enrollment for patients with CKD
and end-stage renal disease.

Despite the advances in dialysis technology over the past decades, patients with 
advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high symptom burden, shortened
survival and substantial physical, emotional and spiritual suffering. Number of
frailty patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is growing and for many of 
them the beginning or continuation of dialysis is associated with a high risk of 
short-term mortality or worsening of functional status. Identifying these fragile
patients and integrating palliative care into standard nephrological care
improves patients quality of life and has the potential to prolong their lives
without demanding dialysis treatment. Nephrologists basic skills should include: 
estimating the prognosis, communication with the patient on advance care planning
including end-of-life issues and consistent symptom management. In fragile
patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, the disease-oriented model with
quantitative targets is no longer an adequate approach to care.

Background: Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have low levels of
physical activity and physical function. Although guidelines endorse exercise
counseling for individuals with CKD, it is not yet part of routine care.
Objective: We investigated the effect of attending a real-life exercise
counseling clinic (ECC) on physical function in individuals with CKD.
Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected observational data with
quasi-experimental design.
Setting and Participants: Patients with all stages of CKD registered in a large
provincial renal program were eligible. The exposed cohort who attended the ECC
between January 1, 2011, and March 15, 2014, included 214 individuals. The
control cohort included 292 individuals enrolled in an observational study
investigating longitudinal change in frailty during the same time period.
Predictor/Factor: Attendance at an ECC.
Outcomes and Measurements: Change in physical function as measured by Short
Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score, physical activity level (Human
Activity Profile [HAP]/Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly [PASE]), and
health-related quality of life (HRQOL; EQ5D/VAS) over 1 year.
Results: Eighty-seven individuals in the ECC cohort and 125 participants in the
control cohort completed 1-year follow-up. Baseline median SPPB score was 10
(interquartile range [IQR]: 9-12) and 9 (IQR: 7-11) in the ECC and control
cohorts, respectively (P < .01). At 1 year, SPPB scores were 10 (IQR: 8-12) and 9
(IQR: 6-11) in the ECC and control cohorts, respectively (P = .04). Mean change
in SPPB over 1 year was not significantly different between groups: -0.33 (95%
confidence interval [CI]: -0.81 to 0.15) in ECC and -0.22 (95% CI: -0.61 to 0.17)
in control (P = .72). There was no significant difference in the proportion of
individuals in each cohort with an increase/decrease in SPPB score over time.
There was no significant change in physical activity or HRQOL over time between
groups.
Limitations: Quasi-experimental design, low rate of follow-up attendance.
Conclusions: In this pragmatic study, exercise counseling had no significant
effect on change in SPPB score, suggesting that a single exercise counseling
session alone is inadequate to improve physical function in CKD.

contrôle ont complété le suivi. Les médianes initiales au test SPPB étaient de 10
(EI: 9-12) et de 9 (EI: 7-11) respectivement (p < 0,01). Après un an, les scores 
au test SPPB étaient pratiquement inchangés: médiane de 10 (EI: 8-12) pour la
cohorte exposée et de 9 pour la cohorte contrôle (EI: 6-11) (p = 0,04). Pendant
l’année du suivi, la variation moyenne du score au test SPPB a été semblable dans
les deux groupes: −0,33 (IC 95 % −0,81 à 0,15) dans la cohorte exposée et −0,22
(IC 95 % −0,61 à 0,17) dans le groupe contrôle (p = 0,72). Au fil du temps, la
proportion d’individus ayant présenté une diminution ou une augmentation du score
au test SPPB était similaire dans les deux groupes; et aucun changement
significatif dans le niveau d’activité physique ou la qualité de vie relative à
l’état de santé n’avait été observé entre les groupes.Les résultats sont limités 
par le modèle quasi expérimental de l’étude et la faible participation au suivi
sur un an.Cette étude pragmatique démontre que le fait de consulter pour un
programme d’entraînement n’a que peu d’effet sur le score obtenu au test SPPB.
Cette observation suggère qu’une seule séance de consultation en vue d’adopter un
programme d’entraînement n’est pas suffisante pour améliorer la condition
physique des patients atteints d’IRC.

The relationship between frailty and chronic kidney disease in elderly population
has been recognized; however, studies concentrating on frailty in predialysis
patients are limited. For nephrologists, the recognition of frailty is important 
as it has impact on decisions on the choice of dialysis modality and sometimes on
whether dialysis is indeed in the patients' best interests. Many of the tools for
routine assessment of frailty are not easily applicable to those clinicians not
practicing elderly care medicine. A tool needs to be simple and applicable for
daily routine practice. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and
clinical outcome of frailty in an elderly predialysis population using simple
tools. A nonrandomized prospective study was conducted in which, 104 patients
aged 65 years or above with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25 mL or
less were included. Data including age, sex, renal function, calcium, albumin,
parathormone, and comorbidities were collected at baseline and at three months
interval for one year. Functional performance was assessed using Karnofsky scale.
The Charlson comorbidity index was used to assess comorbid status of each
patient. Frailty was assessed using a combination of PRISMA questionnaire and
Timed up and Go test. End points were death or start of dialysis at 20-month
follow-up. A frail group (n = 58; males = 32, females = 26) and a nonfrail group 
(n = 46; males = 21, females = 25) were identified. Frailty was prevalent in
53.8% of the selected population. There was no significant difference between
both groups in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, hemoglobin, inflammatory
markers, or calcium hemostasis. Nine patients chose conservative management in
the frail group and six in nonfrail group. Rate of death was significantly higher
in the frail group (death = 14) compared to nonfrail group (death = 3; P = 0.01).
There was no significant difference between both groups in terms of initiation of
dialysis (P = 0.1). Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index were significantly
associated with mortality (P = 0.023 and 0.032, respectively). Survival in frail 
patients who started peritoneal dialysis (PD) was slightly better than those
started on hemodialysis (HD) with hazard ratio = 3.23 (P = 0.23). Our study shows
that the prevalence of frailty and mortality rate is high among elderly
predialysis patients. Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index are independent
predictors of outcome in this population. PD might be a better option of dialysis
modality compared to HD in the frail population.

Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of
diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, 
about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years.
Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive
impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly
more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial
disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a
consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a
considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without
any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with
type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into
account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life
expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals
and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically,
overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in
particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used
with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia
are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function
are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

Objectives The clinical condition of frailty is a common problem in the elderly
population. However, the relationship between peripheral artery disease and
frailty in hemodialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to
identify the relationships between peripheral artery disease and frailty in
Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods A total of 362 chronic
hemodialysis patients who regularly visited six institutions were enrolled. To
evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty phenotype adjusted for Japanese
were used. Peripheral artery disease was defined as ankle-brachial index <0.9.
Results Of 362 patients, 62 patients (17.1%) were categorized as peripheral
artery disease group and 300 patients (82.9%) as Non-peripheral artery disease
group. The prevalence of frailty in the peripheral artery disease group was
significantly higher than in the Non-peripheral artery disease group (34% vs.
18%, P = 0.0103). Non-shunt side grip strength was significantly stronger in the 
Non-peripheral artery disease group (23.6 kg vs. 17.0 kg, P < 0.0001). Thigh
circumferences were also significantly larger in the Non-peripheral artery
disease group (41.7 cm vs. 39.7 cm, P = 0.0054). A multivariate logistic
regression analysis demonstrated that the factors independently associated with
peripheral artery disease were as follows: frailty (odds ratio = 2.06, 95%
confidence interval 1.09-3.89) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 3.74, 95% 
confidence interval 2.05-6.83). Conclusions It is concluded that peripheral
artery disease is closely associated with frailty in hemodialysis patients.

Frailty is significantly associated with bone loss in the general population.
However, it is unclear whether this association also exists in patients
undergoing hemodialysis who have chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder
(CKD-MBD). This study aimed to assess the association between frailty and bone
loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This cross-sectional study included 214
(90 women, 124 men) Japanese outpatients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis
three times per week, with a mean age of 67.1 years (women) and 66.8 years (men).
Frailty was defined based on criteria set forth by the Cardiovascular Health
Study (CHS)-19 (21.1%) women and 47 (37.9%) men were robust, 41 (45.6%) women and
43 (34.7%) men were pre-frail, and 30 (33.3%) women and 34 (27.4%) men were
frail. For bone mass, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters (speed of sound,
broadband ultrasound attenuation, stiffness index) of the calcaneus were
measured. The association between frailty and QUS parameters was determined
separately for women and men using multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), 
with adjustments for clinical characteristics including age, body mass index,
hemodialysis vintage, diabetes, current smoking, serum albumin, phosphate,
corrected calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, and medication for CKD-MBD
(vitamin D receptor activator, calcimimetics). ANCOVA revealed that all QUS
parameters declined significantly with increasing levels of frailty in both sexes
(P < 0.05). In conclusion, frailty (as defined by CHS criteria) should be
considered a risk factor for bone loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcopenia and muscle weakness contribute to fragility and
limit exercise tolerance among patients with CKD. This review focuses on the role
of reduction in mitochondrial mass and function in the myopathy associated with
CKD, causes for these muscle mitochondrial abnormalities, and potential
therapeutic interventions that may improve mitochondrial biogenesis and function 
as well as skeletal muscle function and performance in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial structure, function, and
composition have been shown in both experimental models and patients with CKD. A 
significant reduction in mitochondrial respiratory function and an increase in
mitochondrial complex 1 enzyme activity has been demonstrated in the muscle
tissue of male Sprague-Dawley rats following 5/6 nephrectomy. These changes were 
associated with a substantial reduction in skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass. In
patients with CKD, in-vivo magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy show
significantly elevated resting skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and lower mean 
mitochondrial coupling ratio indicating disrupted muscle mitochondrial metabolism
and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Skeletal muscle biopsies from
patients with advanced CKD show lower mitochondrial volume density and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number than controls.
SUMMARY: Advanced CKD is associated with decreased exercise capacity, skeletal
muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. Impaired mitochondrial respiratory function,
reduced muscle mitochondrial mass, and decreased energy production in skeletal
muscle play a critical role in this 'acquired mitochondrial myopathy' of CKD. It 
is reasonable, therefore, to develop therapeutic interventions that enhance
mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as skeletal muscle function and
performance in patients with CKD.

Vitamin D deficiency state is endemic in the Kashmir valley of the Indian
subcontinent. Clinicians frequently treat patients with Vitamin D for diverse
clinical symptoms to improve the general health and to reduce the frailty of
elderly and these doses may at times be inappropriately high. Vitamin D
toxicity-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), often considered rare, can be
life-threatening and associated with substantial morbidity if not identified
promptly. We aimed to describe clinical and biochemical features, risk factors,
and management of AKI patients with Vitamin D toxicity seen at a single tertiary 
care centre in Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India,
between January 2014 and January 2016. Evaluation included detailed clinical
history and biochemical tests including serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine,
intact parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Nineteen patients 
with Vitamin D toxicity-induced AKI could be identified. Clinical manifestations 
included nausea, vomiting, altered sensorium, constipation, pancreatitis, AKI,
acute on chronic kidney disease, and weight loss. Median (range) age was 64
(45-89) years. Median (range) serum 25(OH)D level and median (range) total serum 
calcium level were 99 (190-988) ng/mL and 139 (119-152) mg/dL, respectively.
Overdose of Vitamin D caused by prescription of megadoses of Vitamin D was the
cause of AKI in all cases. Median (range) cumulative Vitamin D dose was 6,000,000
(3,600,000-9,000,000) IU. On three- and six-month follow-up, the creatinine and
estimated glomerular filtration rate normalized and returned to baseline in all
patients except three cases who had underlying chronic kidney disease. Three
patients needed rehospitalization for another episode of AKI. Our data
demonstrate an emergence of Vitamin D toxicity as a cause of AKI in this part of 
the world. Irrational use of Vitamin D in megadoses resulted in AKI in all cases.
Persistence of Vitamin D in the body for longer time resulted in
rehospitalization of patients with AKI. Awareness among health-care providers
regarding the toxic potential of high doses of Vitamin D and cautious use of
Vitamin D supplements can have immense value to prevent this AKI.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. However,
apart from its influence on cognition, it is currently unknown whether frailty
affects subtler cerebral function in patients with ESRD.
METHODS: Patients with ESRD were prospectively enrolled, with clinical features
and laboratory data recorded. The severity of frailty among these patients with
ESRD was ascertained using the previously validated simple FRAIL scale, and was
categorized as none-to-mild and moderate-to-severe frailty. All participants
underwent quantitative electroencephalography (EEG), with band powers documented 
following the generation of the delta to alpha ratio (DAR) and delta/theta to
alpha/beta ratio (DTABR). EEG results were then compared between groups of
different levels of frailty.
RESULTS: In this cohort, (mean age: 68.9 ± 10.4 years, 37% male, 3.4 ± 3 years of
dialysis), 20, 60, 40, 17, and 6% patients exhibited positivity in the fatigue,
resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss-of-body-weight domains, respectively,
with 45.7% being none to mildly frail and 54.3% being moderately to severely
frail. Those with mild frailty had a significantly higher delta power compared to
those with more severe frailty, involving all topographic sites. Patients with
ESRD and severe frailty had significantly lower global, left frontal, left
temporo-occipital, and right temporo-occipital DAR and DTABR, except in the right
frontal area, and tended to have central accentuation of alpha, beta, and theta
power, and more homogeneous DTABR and DAR distribution compared to the findings
in those with mild frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in patients with ESRD can have subtler neurophysiological
influences, presenting as altered EEG findings, which warrant our attention.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by progressive and
irreversible deterioration of renal function due to the reduction of nephron mass
for a period of at least three months. The prevalence of CKD is roughly 10% in
the general population but increases with age, affecting more than one-third of
people older than 65. Frailty is a condition usually found in elderly people,
characterized by weakness, motility, and balance issues, with a declined ability 
to resist stressors leading to increased risks of adverse health outcomes
including falls, fracture, hospitalization, institutionalization, disability,
dependence, dementia, poor quality of life, and death. There is interdependence
between CKD and normal ageing whereby CKD makes ageing more accelerated and
pronounced (senescence), whereas senescence accelerates chronic nephropathy's
progression. Frailty status catalyzes this spiral, with renal and systemic
consequences, phenomenon which can be named senescent nephropathy. In conclusion,
senescent nephropathy is a new renal syndrome that should be taken into account, 
and we must try to handle its appearance and progression not only by applying
nephron prevention measurements but also by diagnosis and treating frailty in the
CKD population.

Introduction: Frailty and muscle wasting, a component of frailty, are common in
advanced stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). Whether frailty is associated with
low urinary creatinine excretion (UCrE) as a measure of muscle mass in this
population is unknown. Furthermore, reference values of UCrE are lacking. We
first defined low UCrE and studied correlates of low UCrE, and subsequently
studied cross-sectional associations of frailty with low UCrE in patients with
advanced CKD.
Methods: A total of 2748 healthy individuals of the general population-based
PREVEND study were included to define low UCrE (UCrE indexed for height, below
the age- and sex-specific 5th percentile of the distribution). Frailty was
defined using a modification of the Fried frailty phenotype. In a CKD population 
that included 320 and 967 participants of the PREPARE-2 and NECOSAD studies,
respectively, cross-sectional associations of self-reported frailty, the
individual components that define self-reported frailty, and frailty-associated
variables with low UCrE were evaluated using multivariate logistic and linear
regression models.
Results: Low UCrE was found in 38% of the CKD patients. A lower glomerular
filtration rate was strongly associated with low UCrE. Self-reported frailty
(adjusted odds ratio: 2.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.28-3.77) and the
individual components were associated with low UCrE, independent of
comorbidities. The frailty-associated variables hemoglobin and albumin were
inversely associated with low UCrE, and parathyroid hormone was positively
associated with low UCrE.
Discussion: Lower kidney function is a strong correlate of low UCrE and
self-reported frailty, and the individual frailty components are associated with 
low UCrE as well, independent of comorbidities.

AIM: A recent, growing concern regarding haemodialysis in Japan is a sustained
increase in the elderly population. Among very elderly people who start
haemodialysis, the prognosis is considered to be poor; however, this has not been
fully elucidated. This study aimed to discover the short-term prognosis and
related factors in very elderly patients who commence haemodialysis.
METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2013, 122 patients aged ≥85 years at
haemodialysis initiation were documented in our hospital. Predictors of 90-day
and 1-year mortality after haemodialysis initiation were assessed with Cox
proportional hazards regression analysis. Selection of covariates for the
multivariate model was based on forward stepwise selection using the probability 
of a likelihood ratio statistics.
RESULTS: The subjects' mean age was 87.4 ± 2.5 years, and 48% were female. The
most common cause of death was infection (38% of patients) and the leading cause 
of infectious death was pneumonia. The 90-day and 1-year survival rates were 81% 
and 62%, respectively. Suboptimal initiation was a significant prognostic factor 
for 90-day [hazard ratio (HR) 3.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-13.43] and 
1-year [HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.51-6.76] mortality after adjusting for confounders in
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Very elderly patients who started haemodialysis had a poor prognosis,
and suboptimal initiation significantly predicted outcome. Shared decision-making
with patients and their families is needed for initiating haemodialysis on the
conditions that appropriate information on the expected prognosis is provided.

Objectives　To investigate the relationship between frailty, metabolic syndrome
(MetS), and loss of independence leading to the onset of disability or death
among community-dwelling older Japanese.Methods　Between 2002 and 2011, we
conducted a 7-year prospective study involving 1,453 residents aged 65 years and 
over, initially free of disability, who underwent a comprehensive geriatric
assessment in Kusatsu town. Statistical analysis was conducted for those with
complete values, resulting in a variable number of subjects for each data point. 
Frailty was defined for 1,335 subjects as three or more of the following
criteria: weight loss (>2-3 kg in the past six months), weakness (grip strength
was <26 kg for men and <18 kg for women), exhaustion (answer of "no" to the
question "Do you feel full of energy?" on the Geriatric Depression Scale),
slowness (usual gait speed<1.0 m/s), and low physical activity (answer of "less
than once a week" to the question "How often do you usually go outdoors?"). MetS 
was defined for 1,450 subjects from the Japanese definition. The Cox
proportional-hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) of
loss of independence for 1,217 subjects.Results　During the follow-up, 494 cases
of loss of independence, including 376 disabilities and 118 deaths were
identified. In men and women, the incidence of the loss of independence showed a 
significant linear trend according to the severity classification of frailty. By 
contrast, there was no relationship between MetS and the loss of independence.
Subjects classified as prefrail and frail had an increased risk of loss of
independence compared with robust participants, with sex- and age-adjusted HRs
(95% CIs) of 1.5 (1.2-1.9) and 2.4 (1.8-3.3), respectively. After adjusting for
sex, age, the presence of MetS, low serum total cholesterol, chronic kidney
disease, anemia, low serum albumin, cognitive impairment, and past history of
stroke, the respective multivariable HRs (95% CIs) of loss of independence were
1.5 (1.2-1.9) and 2.1 (1.5-2.9). The magnitude of the risk of loss of
independence incidence for frailty was greater among the subjects aged 65-74
years than those aged ≥75 years.Conclusions　Frailty was significantly associated 
with incident loss of independence among elderly Japanese. The presence of MetS
had no effect on subsequent onset of disability and mortality in elderly
Japanese. Our findings suggest screening and intervention for frailty in the
early stage of aging are beneficial to prolong healthy life expectancy of elderly
Japanese.

Introduction: Labeling a patient as "frail" may be useful in assessing the
prognosis and therapeutic approach.
Objective: The aim of the study is to define a pattern of frailty among our
dialysis population, to analyse the incidence and clinical evolution of these
patients.
Materials and Methods: We analysed a total of 320 patients with stage V chronic
kidney disease (CKD) who were on hemodialysis between September 2014 and
September 2015. To define a patient as frail we used the Fried phenotype model,
and we added a new criteria-dialysis session length longer than 12 hours/week.
Results: 5.6% of the 320 patients were frail. We found statistically significant 
differences regarding body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin (Hgb), and serum albumin,
as well as the ability to perform the basic activities of daily living (p <
0.005), ability to ambulate (p = 0.01) and perform transfers (p < 0.005). We
found statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of
hospital admissions (p = 0.005) and mortality (p < 0.005).
Conclusion: 5.6% of the study population were frail, with lower BMI, serum
albumin and hemoglobin, lower capacity for basic activities of daily living,
ambulation, and transference, as well as higher morbidity and mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between serum β2-microglobulin (B2M) levels
and frailty in an elderly Chinese population.
DESIGN: A population-based cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data on 1,663 elderly participants (aged 70-84 
years) from the aging arm of the Rugao Longevity and Ageing study, a
population-based observational two-arm cohort study conducted in Rugao, China.
MEASUREMENTS: The serum B2M was measured with chemiluminescence immunoassay by a 
technician in the biochemistry laboratory of the Rugao People's Hospital.
Information on the frailty index and phenotype was collected.
RESULTS: The mean B2M levels and frailty index were 1.8 mg/L and 0.16,
respectively; 188 (11.3%) participants were classified as frail (frailty
phenotype). For a standard deviation increase in B2M, the adjusted odds ratio for
frailty phenotype was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.39; P=0.009) and the standardized
coefficient for frailty index was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.11; P=0.004). Relative to
the lowest quartile, the highest B2M quartile had a greater risk of prevalent
frailty with adjusted odds ratios of 1.68 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.71; P=0.034) for
frailty phenotype and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.27; P=0.044) for frailty index
(≥0.25). In addition, estimated glomerular filtration rate (based on B2M) or
chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
was significantly associated with frailty phenotype and index.
CONCLUSION: B2M was significantly associated with both frailty phenotype and
index in elderly Chinese population. The findings underscore the promising kidney
relevant biomarkers for identifying vulnerable elderly Chinese population.

BACKGROUND: Contemporary options for aortic valve replacement (AVR) include
transcatheter and surgical approaches (TAVR and SAVR). As evidence accrues for
TAVR in high and intermediate risk patients, some clinicians advocate that all
patients aged over 80 years should only receive TAVR. Our aim was to investigate 
the utility of SAVR and minimally invasive AVR (mAVR) among octogenarians in the 
current era of TAVR.
METHODS: From 2002 to 2015, 1,028 octogenarians underwent isolated AVR; 306 TAVR 
and 722 SAVR, of which 378 patients underwent mAVR. Logistic regression and Cox
modeling were used to evaluate overall operative mortality and mid-term survival,
respectively. Patients were stratified based on procedural approaches (mAVR or
full sternotomy for SAVR, and transfemoral or alternate access for TAVR). Median 
follow-up was 35 [interquartile range (IQR) 14-65] months.
RESULTS: Compared to SAVR patients, TAVR patients were relatively older (86.2
versus 84.2 years) with co-morbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD),
diabetes mellitus (DM), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and prior myocardial
infarction (MI), all P<0.05. The mean STS-PROM for the TAVR group was
statistically higher, 6.81 versus 5.58 for the SAVR group (P<0.001). The median
in-hospital LOS was statistically higher for the SAVR group (P<0.05). Cox
proportional hazard modeling, adjusted for temporal differences in procedure and 
patient selection, identified age, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class
III/IV, preoperative creatinine, severe chronic lung disease, prior cardiac
surgery as significant predictors of decreased survival (all P<0.05), while type 
of intervention (approach) was non-contributory. Adjusted operative mortality
stratified by procedure approaches was similar between full sternotomy SAVR and
mAVR, and between alternative access and transfemoral TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for confounders, TAVR (regardless of approach),
SAVR, and mAVR had comparable operative mortality and mid-term survival.
Treatment decisions should be individualized with consensus from a
multi-disciplinary heart team, taking into account patient co morbidities,
frailty, and quality of life. We believe certain patient groups will still
benefit from SAVR even in this elderly population.

AIM: To evaluate the relationship between kidney function without diabetes and
components of the frailty phenotype in community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: Participants were 8343 residents who completed baseline assessments,
classified into four categories according to eGFR. Frailty status was defined
using five criteria: (i) slow gait speed; (ii) muscle weakness; (iii) low
physical activity; (iv) exhaustion; and (v) unintentional weight loss.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with the lowest kidney
function were at higher risk of frailty (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02-3.50) than those
with normal kidney function. In addition, after adjustment for multiple
confounders, estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 was associated with a
greater risk of the individual frailty components of weight loss (OR 2.14, 95% CI
1.11-4.12), low physical activity (OR 1.35, 95% CI, 1.01-2.54) and slowness (OR
1.82, 95% CI 1.36-3.77) compared with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower kidney function was associated with a higher risk of weight
loss, low physical activity and slowness among community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 286-292.

thromboembolism.Design Retrospective matched cohort study conducted between 1
January 2009 and 31 March 2016.Setting Community based, using healthcare data
from six jurisdictions in Canada and the United States.Participants 59 525 adults
(12 489 DOAC users; 47 036 warfarin users) with a new diagnosis of venous
thromboembolism and a prescription for a DOAC or warfarin within 30 days of
diagnosis.Main outcome measures Outcomes included hospital admission or emergency
department visit for major bleeding and all cause mortality within 90 days after 
starting treatment. Propensity score matching and shared frailty models were used
to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of the outcomes comparing DOACs with warfarin.
Analyses were conducted independently at each site, with meta-analytical methods 
used to estimate pooled hazard ratios across sites.Results Of the 59 525
participants, 1967 (3.3%) had a major bleed and 1029 (1.7%) died over a mean
follow-up of 85.2 days. The risk of major bleeding was similar for DOAC compared 
with warfarin use (pooled hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to
1.03), with the overall direction of the association favouring DOAC use. No
difference was found in the risk of death (pooled hazard ratio 0.99, 0.84 to
1.16) for DOACs compared with warfarin use. There was no evidence of
heterogeneity across centres, between patients with and without chronic kidney
disease, across age groups, or between male and female patients.Conclusions In
this analysis of adults with incident venous thromboembolism, treatment with
DOACs, compared with warfarin, was not associated with an increased risk of major
bleeding or all cause mortality in the first 90 days of treatment.Trial
registration Clinical trials NCT02833987.

BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness is a risk factor for mortality in hemodialysis (HD)
patients. Muscle strength measurements are routinely used as a screening tool but
depend on patient cooperation and motivation. We wished to determine whether
measuring maximal voluntary muscle strength was affected by patient self-reported
distress.
METHODS: We measured pinch strength (PS) and handgrip strength (HGS) in 382 adult
HD patients with a corresponding self-reported distress thermometer (DT) scores. 
Postdialysis body composition measurements were made using multifrequency
bioelectrical assessments and patients assessed for frailty.
RESULTS: Mean age was 66.4 ± 14.9 years, with 238 males (62%), 48% diabetic, and 
dialysis vintage 36 (15-75) months. The mean DT score was 4.4 ± 3.3, with a
frailty score of 4.6 ± 1.5. On multivariable analysis, DT scores were associated 
with frailty (β = 0.35, P = .003), prescription of aspirin for cardiac disease (β
= 1.0, P = .004), lean body mass (β = 0.04, P = .004), and negatively with age (β
= -0.05, P < .001), hematocrit (β = -8.2, P = .004), and maximum PS (β = -1.4, P 
= .003).
CONCLUSION: Paradoxically higher self-reported DT scores were associated with
younger age and lean body mass. As such, younger healthier, rather than more
comorbid, patients may have greater expectations for their health and therefore
report more distress. We found no association between DT scores and HGS, and as
such, although HGS is a voluntary test, it appears to be a robust test
independent of patient stresses. However, PS was lower in patients with higher DT
scores, and as such, greater care may be required in interpreting these
measurements.

Objectives To derive and validate a risk prediction equation to estimate the
short term risk of death, and to develop a classification method for frailty
based on risk of death and risk of unplanned hospital
admission.Design Prospective open cohort study.Participants Routinely collected
data from 1436 general practices contributing data to QResearch in England
between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used to develop the scores and a
separate set of 357 practices to validate the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 
65-100 years were in the derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the
validation cohort.Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation
cohort were used to derive separate risk equations in men and women for
evaluation of the risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age,
sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index,
medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent
investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the
validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group.
The new mortality equation was used in conjunction with the existing QAdmissions 
equation (which predicts risk of unplanned hospital admission) to classify
patients into frailty groups.Main outcome measure The primary outcome was all
cause mortality.Results During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the
derivation cohort arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The
final model included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic
group, smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the past 
12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive heart failure,
corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, learning disability,
leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, poor
mobility, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2
diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result,
high platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite loss,
unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good calibration and
high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the equation
explained 55.6% of the variation in time to death (R2), and had very good
discrimination-the D statistic was 2.29, and Harrell's C statistic value was
0.85. The corresponding values for men were 53.1%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining
predicted risks of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7% of patients 
(n=13 665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4% (n=46 770) as moderately
frail, 43.1% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8% (n=223 790) as
fit.Conclusions We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of
death in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social,
and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate
validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction with the
QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty groups (known as
QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be identified for further assessment
or interventions.

Hyperphosphatemia is related to some pathologies, affecting vascular cell
behavior. This work analyzes whether high concentration of extracellular
phosphate induces endothelial senescence through up-regulation of endothelin-1
(ET-1), exploring the mechanisms involved. The phosphate donor β-glycerophosphate
(BGP) in human endothelial cells increased ET-1 production, endothelin-converting
enzyme-1 (ECE-1) protein, and mRNA expression, which depend on the AP-1
activation through ROS production. In parallel, BGP also induced endothelial
senescence by increasing p16 expression and the senescence-associated
β-galactosidase (SA-ß-GAL) activity. ET-1 itself was able to induce endothelial
senescence, increasing p16 expression and SA-ß-GAL activity. In addition,
senescence induced by BGP was blocked when different ET-1 system antagonists were
used. BGP increased ROS production at short times, and the presence of
antioxidants prevented the effect of BGP on AP1 activation, ECE-1 expression, and
endothelial senescence. These findings were confirmed in vivo with two animal
models in which phosphate serum levels were increased: seven/eight nephrectomized
rats as chronic kidney disease models fed on a high phosphate diet and aged mice.
Both models showed hyperphosphatemia, higher levels of ET-1, and up-regulation in
aortic ECE-1, suggesting a direct relationship between hyperphosphatemia and
ET-1. Present results point to a new and relevant role of hyperphosphatemia on
the regulation of ET-1 system and senescence induction at endothelial level, both
in endothelial cells and aorta from two animal models. The mechanism involved
showed a higher ROS production, which probably activates AP-1 transcription
factor and, as a result, ECE-1 expression, increasing ET-1 synthesis, which in
consequence induces endothelial senescence.

OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia measured by decreased psoas muscle size has been used as a 
surrogate for frailty and correlates with adverse outcomes in both the short and 
long term after many major operations. Our aim was to evaluate this measure as a 
predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair 
(EVAR).
METHODS: Once Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, all patients who 
underwent EVAR from December 2010 to March 2016 at a Veterans Affairs hospital
were assessed for sarcopenia by total psoas muscle area (TPA) measured on axial
computed tomography scan immediately inferior to the fourth lumbar (L4) superior 
end plate. Outcomes including length of stay and mortality were collected from
the medical record.
RESULTS: There were 135 patients who underwent EVAR at a median age of 70 years. 
Median aneurysm size was 5.5 cm. Length of stay was >2 days in 25% of patients
(n = 33), with the most common reasons for delayed discharge including
respiratory complications (8.9% [n = 12]) and urinary retention (4.0% [n = 9]).
Low TPA was not associated with extended length of stay (P = .40). Patients with 
lowest tertile TPA had 42% 5-year survival compared with 93% survival observed
for the remaining two-thirds of patients (P = .01). Multivariate analysis
revealed increased likelihood of mortality at 5 years for patients in the lowest 
tertile for TPA (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.9) as well as
for patients with chronic kidney disease (odds ratio, 5.2; 95% confidence
interval, 1.5-18.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative sarcopenia does not appear to affect length of stay but
does portend worse long-term survival. This simple preoperative measurement may
help vascular surgeons tailor repair thresholds and avoid nonbeneficial
procedures.

AIM: to assess the prevalence of some geriatric syndromes and their association
with high risk of cardiovascular complications (RCVC) among elderly women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 72 women aged 69-77 years with cardiovascular
diseases. Examination included laboratory and echocardiography assessment,
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, 6-min walk test, assessment of psycho-emotional
status using Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire. Frailty was
defined as three or more of the following: weight loss, low physical activity
levels, MMSE less or equal 23 points, weakness (chair stand test>10 sec), history
of multiple falls. Follow up was 7.3 (5.5-7.8) months.
RESULTS: High CVR was found in 70.8% women: in 59.1% women aged 65-74 years and
in 89.3% - aged more or equal 75 years, =0.006. Osteoporosis (OP) was found in
51.3% women aged 65-74 and in 90.5% - aged more or equal 75 years, =0.024; MMSE
was 27 (24-28) vs 24 (20-26) points, respectively, =0.008. The geriatric syndrome
of frailty was found in 13.6% women aged 65-74 and in 64.3% - aged more or equal 
75 years. Frailty was associated with high CVR (odds ratio [R] 7.2, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.5-34.2, =0.013), chronic kidney disease (CKD, R 18.9, 
95%CI 5.2-20.2, <0.001), P (R 4.5, 95%CI 1.3-15.8, =0.019), history of myocardial
infarction (MI, R 6.8, 95%CI 2.2-20.8, =0.001), greater age (R 6.0, 95%CI
2.1-17.5, =0.001).
CONCLUSION: High CVR was prevalent among greater age women what could be
explained by prevalence of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, CKD.
Prevalence of frailty was 13.6 and 64.3% among women aged 65-74 and more or equal
75years, respectively. It was significantly associated with high CVR, OP, PMI,
CKD.

Prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide principally
among the elderly population many of whom will eventually need renal replacement 
therapy. The relationship between frailty and CKD in the elderly population has
been recognized. However, studies concentrating on frailty in pre-dialysis
patients are limited. CKD predisposes to frailty through many potential
mechanisms; anemia, bone mineral disease, oxidative stress, and malnutrition
which in turn lead to progression of CKD culminating in a vicious cycle.
Identifying potential causes of frailty in elderly pre-dialysis patients and
recognizing individuals at risk should be an area of focus to nephrologists and
researchers. Modalities that may improve frailty in elderly pre-dialysis patients
such as treatment of anemia and bone mineral disease may improve outcome.
However, this has not been established and further research is needed. The aim of
this review is to address the importance of recognizing frailty in elderly
pre-dialysis patients using simple tools and describing its implications on
clinical outcome.

BACKGROUND: Frailty exhibits a high prevalence in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
patients and is associated with adverse health-related outcomes, including falls 
and fractures. Available studies do not address whether frailty is associated
with temporal changes in BMD. We evaluated this issue by analyzing the follow-up 
dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results in an ESRD cohort.
METHODS: In 2015, we enrolled forty-three ESRD patients, divided into frail,
pre-frail, and robust ones based on a validated simple FRAIL scale, all receiving
DXA at baseline. After one year of follow-up, survivors received another DXA, and
we calculated the absolute and percentage changes in area, bone mineral density
(BMD), T-, and Z-scores of lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN) between baseline
and follow-up examinations.
RESULTS: Among all, frail individuals with ESRD had significantly lower average
lumbar spine area, lower L4, FN, and total BMD and T-scores, lower FN and total
Z-scores than non-frail ones, without differences in gender, body mass index,
dialysis duration, and comorbidities. Furthermore, we discovered frail ESRD
patients had significantly more prominent decrease in average lumbar spine area, 
percentage changes in L1 Z-scores and average lumbar spine area, and a trend
toward more prominent decrease in L4 area than non-frail ones after one year of
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline frailty might be associated with deteriorating bone health,
including shrinking L-spine areas and a more rapid decrease in L-spine Z scores, 
among ESRD patients. This frailty-bone association should be highlighted during
our care of frail individuals with ESRD.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

Renal disease is a common health condition that leads to loss of physical
function, frailty, and premature loss of independence in addition to other severe
comorbidities and increased mortality. Increased levels of physical activity and 
initiation of exercise training is recommended in the current guidelines for all 
patients with renal disease, but participation and adherence rates are low. The
barriers to exercise and physical activity in patients with renal disease are not
well defined and currently based on patient provider perception and opinion.
There have been no published reviews that have synthesized published findings on 
patient reported barriers to exercise. This integrative literature review
therefore aimed to identify the current understanding of patient reported
barriers to regular exercise. This integrative review found that patient
perceived barriers to exercise are not consistent with the barriers that have
been identified by renal disease specialists and healthcare providers, which were
disinterest, lack of motivation, and being incapable of exercise. The patient
reported barriers identified through this review were complex and diverse, and
the most frequently reported patient perceived barrier to exercise was low energy
levels and fatigue. It is clear that additional research to identify patient
perceived barriers to exercise is needed and that patient directed interventions 
to address these barriers should be developed. This integrative review provides
information to the interdisciplinary nephrology team that can be used to tailor
their assessment of barriers to exercise and provide exercise education for
patients with renal disease.

BACKGROUND: Predicting outcomes in those with chronic kidney disease or following
transplantation is challenging, and current models lack detailed patient-level
information. Frailty and poor functional status are risk factors for adverse
patient outcomes that may be useful additions to prognostic tools in patients
with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine 
whether frailty or functional status are associated with increased risk of
mortality or adverse clinical outcomes in patients with advanced kidney disease.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review to identify and evaluate
studies linking frailty and functional status with patient outcomes in
populations with advanced kidney disease. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, and the
Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials. Two reviewers will conduct all
screening and data extraction independently. A modified version of the Quality In
Prognosis Studies tool will be used to evaluate the quality of the studies. If
meta-analysis of outcome data is possible, a random effects model will be used.
DISCUSSION: The results of this review will inform the development, selection,
and validation of appropriate metrics needed to improve prognostication in
patients with chronic kidney disease.

INTRODUCTION: This article ponders upon wearable medical measurement devices in
relation to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its' associated comorbidities - and 
whether these might benefit CKD-patients. We aimed to map the intersection(s) of 
nephrology and wearable sensor technology to help technologists understand
medical aspects, and clinicians to understand technological possibilities that
are available (or soon will become so). Areas covered: A structured literature
search on main comorbidities and complications CKD patients suffer from, was used
to steer mini-reviews on wearable sensor technologies clustered around 3 themes
being: Cardiovascular-related, diabetes-related and physical fitness/frailty.
This review excludes wearable dialysis - although also strongly enabled by
miniaturization - because that highly important theme deserves separate in-depth 
reviewing. Expert commentary: Continuous progress in integrated electronics
miniaturization enormously lowered price, size, weight and energy consumption of 
electronic sensors, processing power, memory and wireless connectivity. These
combined factors boost opportunities for wearable medical sensors. Such devices
can be regarded as enablers for: Remote monitoring, influencing human behaviour
(exercise, dietary), enhanced home care, remote consults, patient education and
peer networks. However, to make wearable medical devices succeed, the challenge
to fit them into health care structures will be dominant over the challenge to
realize the bare technologies themselves.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and
associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in
frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we
examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of
Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in 
ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24
months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled
frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during
follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of
frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores
changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change,
0.2 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity
(0.6 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7
points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher
frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores
(-1.1 points per g/dl; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition,
patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become
frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction
in frailty score (95% confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the
underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included
serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of
hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and
hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at
any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic
rate was not independently associated with frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores,
with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of 
inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening
frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or 
posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.

Many patients become frail with diminished cardiorespiratory fitness while
awaiting kidney transplantation. Frailty and poor fitness powerfully predict
mortality, transplant graft survival, and healthcare utilization after kidney
transplantation. Efforts to intervene with post-transplant physical therapy have 
been met with limited success, in large part due to high study dropout. We
reviewed the literature on chronic kidney disease and exercise to propose a
clinical framework for physical therapy interventions to improve fitness,
scheduled for before the transplant. This framework may lead to better patient
retention and compliance, and thus demonstrate better efficacy in mitigating the 
effects of frailty and poor fitness after kidney transplantation.

Frailty is a common complication in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) under dialysis, which is a strong risk factor for low quality of life,
morbidity, and mortality. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of
frailty in a group of Portuguese ESRD patients, and its association with
socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. We performed a
cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3
[±14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients
as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire.
Social support, data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and
haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory
markers were also evaluated. Our results confirmed that frailty is a highly
prevalent condition in ESRD patients, particularly in female patients. An
association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of
hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered a model of accelerated aging. More
specifically, CKD leads to reduced physical functioning and increased frailty,
increased vascular dysfunction, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness,
high levels of systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased 
cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence suggests that the cognitive impairment 
associated with CKD may be related to cerebral small vessel disease and overall
impairment in white matter integrity. The triad of poor physical function,
vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment places patients living with CKD at
an increased risk for loss of independence, poor health-related quality of life, 
morbidity, and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the available 
evidence of cerebrovascular-renal axis and its interconnection with early and
accelerated cognitive impairment in patients with CKD and the plausible role of
exercise as a therapeutic modality. Understanding the cerebrovascular-renal axis 
pathophysiological link and its interconnection with physical function is
important for clinicians in order to minimize the risk of loss of independence
and improve quality of life in patients with CKD.

Patients with chronic kidney disease experience substantial loss of muscle mass, 
weakness, and poor physical performance. As kidney disease progresses, skeletal
muscle dysfunction forms a common pathway for mobility limitation, loss of
functional independence, and vulnerability to disease complications. Screening
for those at high risk for mobility disability by self-reported and objective
measures of function is an essential first step in developing an
interdisciplinary approach to treatment that includes rehabilitative therapies
and counseling on physical activity. Exercise has beneficial effects on systemic 
inflammation, muscle, and physical performance in chronic kidney disease. Kidney 
health providers need to identify patient and care delivery barriers to exercise 
in order to effectively counsel patients on physical activity. A thorough medical
evaluation and assessment of baseline function using self-reported and objective 
function assessment is essential to guide an effective individualized exercise
prescription to prevent function decline in persons with kidney disease. This
review focuses on the impact of kidney disease on skeletal muscle dysfunction in 
the context of the disablement process and reviews screening and treatment
strategies that kidney health professionals can use in clinical practice to
prevent functional decline and disability.

Frailty is a distinct phenotype that is highly prevalent in chronic kidney
disease (CKD) and appears to be more prevalent with decreasing glomerular
filtration rate. Exercise training or intervention to increase physical activity 
may ameliorate poor physical functioning and frailty, and even may improve
survival in patients with CKD. Although exercise interventions improve outcomes
across the spectrum of CKD, including patients treated with dialysis, patients
treated with dialysis face barriers to exercise that patients with predialysis
CKD do not. Rehabilitation at earlier stages of CKD (or prehabilitation before
dialysis) might be more beneficial than not addressing the decreasing physical
functioning and low physical activity until patients are receiving dialysis. This
review summarizes available literature on frailty in the CKD and end-stage renal 
disease population, including exercise interventions and the limited evidence for
prehabilitation as a strategy.

BACKGROUND: The risk of incorrect medication dosing is high in frail older
people. Therefore, accurate assessment of the glomerular filtration rate is
important.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the estimated glomerular
filtration rate using creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae, the Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, in frail older
people. We hypothesized that frailty determines the difference between the
creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae.
METHODS: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C was
determined using (cross-sectional) data of 55 patients (mean age 73 years)
admitted to a psychiatric ward for older adults. The level of agreement of these 
estimations was assessed by a Bland-Altman analysis. In all patients, the
Rockwood's Frailty Index was derived and correlated with the mean difference
between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C.
RESULTS: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine (mean
71.2 mL/min/1.73 m2) and CKD-EPI cystatin C (mean 57.6 mL/min/1.73 m2) was
13.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.0001). The two standard deviation limit in the
Bland-Altman plot was large (43.2 mL/min/1.73 m2), which represents a low level
of agreement. The Frailty Index did not correlate with the mean difference
between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based glomerular filtration rate (Pearson 
correlation coefficient 0.182, p = 0.184).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant gap between a creatinine- and cystatin
C-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate, irrespective of frailty. The
range of differences between the commonly used estimated glomerular filtration
rate formulae might result in clinically relevant differences in drug
prescription and differences in chronic kidney disease staging.

OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized 
loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, with the risk of frailty and poor
quality of life. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of
sarcopenia and to investigate the effects of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation
(CCR), including nutrition, physical exercise and medication, in patients with
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 322 inpatients with CVD (age 72±12 years).
Muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance were assessed before and
after exercise training in patients with and without sarcopenia, which was
defined as either a gait speed of <0.8 m/s or reduced handgrip strength (<26 kg
in males and <18 kg in females), together with lower skeletal muscle index (SMI) 
(<7.0 kg/m2 in males and <5.7 kg/m2 in females). The actual daily total calorie
and nutrient intake was also calculated.
RESULTS: Sarcopenia was identified in 28% of patients with CVD, these patients
having a higher prevalence of symptomatic chronic heart failure and chronic
kidney disease. SMI was significantly associated with protein intake and statin
treatment. The ratio of peak VO2 and SMI was significantly higher in the statin
treatment group. Handgrip strength, gait speed, leg weight bearing index, and
nutritional intake improved after exercise training in patients both with and
without sarcopenia.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that CCR is a promising strategy for
prevention and treatment of sarcopenia in patients with CVD.

Background: The burden of chronic kidney disease is highest among older adults
but the significance of a diminished level of kidney function in this
heterogeneous population is poorly understood. We sought to examine the
relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and objective
physical performance in older adults.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 4,562 participants from The Irish
Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a national cohort of community-dwelling adults aged
≥50 years. We used multivariable linear or quantile regression to model the
association between categories of cystatin C (eGFRcys) or creatinine eGFR
(eGFRcr) and the following outcomes: gait speed, timed-up-and-go (TUG) and grip
strength. Relationships were further explored using natural eGFR splines. We
examined effect modification by age in the relationship between eGFR and gait
speed.
Results: Mean (SD) age was 61.8 (8.3) years, 53.6% were female and median (IQR)
eGFRcys was 82 (70-94) mL/min/1.73m2. In multivariable-adjusted models,
participants in the lowest eGFRcys category (< 45 mL/min/1.73m2) had 3.32 cm/s
(95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.02-6.62) slower mean gait speed, 1.32 kg
(95%CI 0.20-2.44) lower mean grip strength, and 0.31 seconds (95% CI -0.04 to
0.65) longer median TUG versus the reference group (eGFRcys ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2). 
The relationship between eGFRcys and outcomes appeared linear but varied by age. 
The association between eGFRcr and outcomes tended towards a U-shape.
Conclusions: Cystatin C eGFR was linearly related to poorer physical performance 
beyond middle age among community-dwelling adults. The non-linear relationships
observed with eGFRcr underscore the limitations of creatinine as a predictor of
frailty outcomes in older individuals.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review and
meta-analysis on prevalence of frailty among patients with end-stage renal
disease (ESRD). ESRD is associated with malnutrition, chronic inflammation,
acidemia, impaired hormonal changes, and low physical activity, all of which can 
directly and indirectly contribute to the development of frailty. Coexistence of 
ESRD and frailty has been shown to increase risks of adverse health outcomes.
Given potential reversibility of frailty, it is important to examine frailty
status in this high-risk population.
METHODS: Three databases (EMBASE, Medline, and CINAHL) were systematically
searched for studies providing cross-sectional data of prevalence of frailty
defined by cardiovascular health study (CHS) criteria among ESRD patients.
Meta-analysis calculated pooled prevalence of frailty according to modifications 
of CHS criteria.
RESULTS: Of 837 studies identified through the systematic review, seven studies
were included. Three studies used both objectively measured and self-reported CHS
criteria, and two studies each used only either criteria. Pooled prevalence of
frailty was 36.8% (five studies: 95% CI = 29.9-44.1%, I 2 = 82.6%, p < 0.001) and
67.0% (five studies: 95% CI = 58.7-74.7%, I 2 = 96.5%, p < 0.001) according to
the objectively measured and self-reported CHS criteria, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of ESRD patients were frail based on the
objectively measured CHS criteria, and that prevalence of frailty almost doubled 
with the CHS criteria substituting self-reported physical function questionnaire 
score for objective measurements. Given substantial difference in prevalence of

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review sarcopenia in chronic kidney
disease (CKD). We aim to present how definitions of sarcopenia from the general
population may pertain to those with CKD, its assessment by clinicians and
emerging therapies for sarcopenia in CKD. For this review, we limit our
description and recommendations to patients with CKD who are not on dialysis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Poorer parameters of lean mass, strength and physical function
are associated with worsening patient-centered outcomes such as limiting
mobility, falls and mortality in CKD; however, the magnitude of these
associations are different in those with and without CKD. Sarcopenia in CKD is a 
balance between skeletal muscle regeneration and catabolism, which are both
altered in the uremic environment. Multiple pathways are involved in these
derangements, which are briefly reviewed. Differences between commonly used terms
cachexia, frailty, protein-energy wasting, dynapenia and sarcopenia are
described. Therapeutic options in predialysis CKD are not well studied;
therefore, we review exercise options and emerging pharmacological therapies.
SUMMARY: Sarcopenia, now with its own International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision (ICD-10) code, is of importance clinically and should be accounted 
for in research studies in patients with CKD. Multiple therapies for sarcopenia
are in development and will hopefully be available for our patients in the
future.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical implications of frailty in chronic kidney 
disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and chronic peritoneal
dialysis.
DESIGN: In this prospective study, all of the participants completed the Short
Form of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, Korean version, to
determine their frailty phenotype. We also obtained blood chemistry and
demographic data at enrollment. Data regarding the history of hospitalization and
death were collected during the follow-up period.
SUBJECTS: We recruited 1,658 patients (1,255 maintenance hemodialysis and 403
chronic peritoneal dialysis) from multidialysis units (n = 27). We excluded
patients who had been hospitalized in the previous 3 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalization and survival rate during study period.
RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 55.2 ± 11.9 years old, and 55.2% were
male. Among the participants, 34.8% were rated as frail and 45.7% as prefrail.
Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant associations of frailty with age, 
comorbidity, disability, unemployment, higher body mass index, and a lower
educational level. During the follow-up period (median 17.1 months), 608 patients
(79 not frail, 250 prefrail, and 279 frail) were hospitalized, and 87 patients
(10 not frail, 24 prefrail, and 53 frail) died (P < .001). Frailty was associated
with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval:
1.38-2.36) and mortality (hazard ratio, 2.37, 95% confidence interval:
1.11-5.02).
CONCLUSION: The frailty phenotype was common even in, prevalent end-stage renal
disease patients on dialysis, and was significantly associated with higher rates 
of hospitalization and mortality.

It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased
postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease 
who underwent lower extremity surgical revascularization; however, outcomes after
peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) are less well established. This study
sought to determine the impact of CKD on adverse outcomes in patients with
peripheral artery disease who underwent PVI. Using data from the Veteran Affairs 
Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System Program, we identified a
cohort of 755 patients who underwent lower extremity PVI from June 2005 to August
2010 at 33 sites. The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to
dialysis, myocardial infarction, limb amputation, and stroke. Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard frailty models assessed the
association between CKD and adverse outcomes. Of the patients who underwent lower
extremity PVI, 201 patients (27%) had CKD. The presence of CKD was associated
with decreased survival (5-year survival probability of CKD compared with
non-CKD: 49.9% [41.6% to 59.9%] vs 80.1% [76.2% to 84.1]), which persisted after 
risk adjustment (HR 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.19). In addition,
there was a significant association between CKD and progression to dialysis (HR
6.62; 95% confidence interval 2.25 to 19.43). In contrast, there was no
association between CKD and re-hospitalization for myocardial infarction, limb
amputation, or stroke. In conclusion, CKD is present in 1 of 4 patients who
underwent PVI and is associated with increased risk of mortality and progression 
to dialysis.

BACKGROUND: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including 
adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key
consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures
of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with
complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013).
PREDICTORS: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated
using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine
albumin-creatinine ratio.
OUTCOME: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty
characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical
activity).
RESULTS: 341 (7%) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30%) had
eGFRcr<60mL/min/1.73m2, 2,480 (50%) had eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2, and 1,006 (20%) 
had albuminuria with albumin excretion ≥ 30mg/g. Among frail participants,
prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2 were 45% and 77%, respectively.
Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a 
strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals
with eGFRcr of 60 to <75mL/min/1.73m2 were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR 
categories using eGFRcys (49% to 45-<60, 32% to 30-<45, and 3%
to <30mL/min/1.73m2). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking ≥10 classes of medications) was
more common in frail individuals (54% vs 38% of nonfrail), including classes
requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent
complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants).
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, 
with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys
versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic
kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative
biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this
vulnerable population.

The scope of this article is to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors
associated with the frailty of elderly people with chronic kidney disease on
hemodialysis. This involved a correlational, cross-sectional study conducted in a
dialysis center in the state of São Paulo. The sample consisted of 60
participants. The Participant Characterization Instrument was used for extracting
sociodemographic and clinical data and the Edmonton Frail Scale was used to
evaluate the level of frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
identify the factors associated with frailty. The mean age of the 60 patients
included was 71.1 (± 6.9) years, predominantly male (70%), of which 36.7% were
classified as frail. With respect to the factors associated with frailty among
the variables of gender, age, self-reported skin color, schooling, monthly per
capita income, hemodialysis time, number of associated diseases, falls in the
year, hematocrit level, parathyroid hormone and use of calcitriol, it was found
that only the monthly per capita income was significantly associated with frailty
(OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.1-0.9; p = 0.04). There was an association between frailty
and income, showing that the elderly most at risk of frailty were those with
lower income.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is associated with increased vulnerability to poor health.
There is growing interest in understanding the association between frailty and
chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review explored how frailty is
measured in patients with CKD and the association between frailty and adverse
outcomes across different stages of renal impairment.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic analysis of peer reviewed articles.
DATA SOURCES: Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane were used to identify 
the articles.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Articles published before the 17th of September 2016, that
measured frailty in patients with CKD was eligible for the systematic review. Two
independent researchers assessed the eligibility of the articles. Quality of the 
articles was assessed using the Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 540 articles, of which 32 met the study
criteria and were included in the review (n=36,076, age range: 50-83 years).
Twenty-three (72%) studies used or adapted the Fried phenotype to measure
frailty. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 7% in community-dwellers (CKD
Stages 1-4) to 73% in a cohort of patients on haemodialysis. The incidence of
frailty increased with reduced glomerular filtration rate. Frailty was associated
with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is prevalent in patients with CKD and it is associated with
an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. There are differences in the
methods used to assess frailty and this hinders comparisons between studies.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older
adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive
impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of
life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in
increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in
hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients 
with pre-dialysis CKD.
METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385
patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated 
tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive
frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial.
Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of ≤24. We determined the
prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages 
G4-G5, not on dialysis.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5
had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control
group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most
pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function 
(p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of
stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment
in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects
of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of
cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes
deserves further study.

AIM: To investigate associations between clinical parameters - beyond the evident
physiological deterioration and limitations of medical treatment - with
in-hospital death for patients receiving Rapid Response System (RRS) attendances.
METHODS: Retrospective case-control analysis of clinical parameters for 328
patients aged 60 years and above at their last RRS call during admission to a
single teaching hospital in the 2012-2013 calendar years. Generalised estimating 
equation modelling was used to compare the deceased with a randomly selected
sample of those who had RRS calls and survived admission (controls), matched by
age group, sex, and hospital ward.
RESULTS: In addition to a pre-existing order for limitation of treatment or
cardiac arrest (OR 6.92; 95%CI 4.61-10.27), nursing home residence, proteinuria, 
advanced malignancy, acute myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease,
cognitive impairment and frailty were associated with high risk of death. After
adjusting for all the clinical indicators investigated, the strongest risk
factors for in-hospital death for patients with a RRS call were advanced
malignancy (OR 3.95; 95%CI 2.16-7.21) and new myocardial infarction (OR 2.79;
95%CI 1.86-4.20). Patients with cognitive impairment, frailty indicator or
chronic kidney disease were twice as likely to die as patients without those risk
factors.
CONCLUSION: In a sample of older deteriorated patients requiring a RRS
attendance, multiple indicators of chronic illness, cognitive impairment and
frailty were significantly associated with high risk of death. These clinical
features beyond the evident orders for limitation of medical treatment should
signal the need for clinicians to initiate end-of-life discussions that may
prevent futile interventions.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney
function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in
community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level,
and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0
(normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Frailty status
was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle
weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of
having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were more frail
(odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition,
individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or
hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of
frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. 
Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty 
in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI
1.13-14.1) CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a
higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Geriatr

Dysregulation of skeletal remodeling is a component of renal osteodystrophy.
Previously, we showed that activin receptor signaling is differentially affected 
in various tissues in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether a ligand
trap for the activin receptor type 2A (RAP-011) is an effective treatment of the 
osteodystrophy of the CKD-mineral bone disorder. With a 70% reduction in the
glomerular filtration rate, CKD was induced at 14 weeks of age in the ldlr-/-
high fat-fed mouse model of atherosclerotic vascular calcification and diabetes. 
Twenty mice with CKD, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated
activin A were treated with RAP-011, wherease 19 mice were given vehicle twice
weekly from week 22 until the mice were killed at 28 weeks of age. The animals
were then evaluated by skeletal histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography,
mechanical strength testing, and ex vivo bone cell culture. Results in the CKD
groups were compared with those of the 16 sham-operated ldlr-/- high fat-fed
mice. Sham-operated mice had low-turnover osteodystrophy and skeletal frailty.
CKD stimulated bone remodeling with significant increases in osteoclast and
osteoblast numbers and bone resorption. Compared with mice with CKD
and sham-operated mice, RAP-011 treatment eliminated the CKD-induced increase in 
these histomorphometric parameters and increased trabecular bone fraction.
RAP-011 significantly increased cortical bone area and thickness. Activin
A-enhanced osteoclastogenesis was mediated through p-Smad2 association with c-fos
and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Thus, an
ActRIIA ligand trap reversed CKD-stimulated bone remodeling, likely through
inhibition of activin-A induced osteoclastogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its
impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
is less defined.
METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 
trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three
groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR
≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were
analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors
of 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the
PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767
(30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 
(12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted
Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with
severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher
prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of
death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate
and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% 
in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild
RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus
none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other
significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass
index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction,
oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male
sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year
mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is
required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent in the United States and
throughout the world,(1) with approximately 13% of adults affected.(2) In
addition, according to recent estimates, almost half of patients with CKD stages 
3 to 5 are 70 years of age and older.(2) In the United States, the number of
prevalent end-stage renal disease cases continues to increase in patients older
than age 65. In light of the demographic characteristics of patients with CKD and
ESRD, there has been considerable focus on associations between CKD and
cardiovascular outcomes.(3) Until recently, less attention had been paid to other
consequences of CKD in general and among older individuals with CKD in
particular, but there is now solid evidence linking CKD with impairments of
physical function, cognitive function, and emotional function and quality of
life. This review summarizes available literature on these topics, focusing
specifically on physical functioning and frailty, cognitive function, emotional
health, including depression and anxiety, and health-related quality of life.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem that is associated
with excess morbidity, mortality, and health resource utilization. The
progression of CKD is defined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and
leads to a variety of metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypertension,
anemia, and mineral bone disorder. Lower glomerular filtration rate also bears a 
strong relationship with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, end-stage
renal disease, and death. Patterns of CKD progression include linear and
nonlinear trajectories, but kidney function can remain stable for years in some
individuals. Addressing modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD is
needed to attenuate its associated morbidity and mortality. Developing effective 
risk prediction models for CKD progression is critical to identify patients who
are more likely to benefit from interventions and more intensive monitoring.
Accurate risk-prediction algorithms permit systems to best align health care
resources with risk to maximize their effects and efficiency while guiding
overall decision making.

The incidence and prevalence of chronic renal disease (CKD) in elderly patients
are continuously increasing worldwide. Loss of renal function is not only
considered to be part of the aging process itself but also reflects the
multimorbidity of many geriatric patients. Calculating the glomerular filtration 
rate using specific algorithms validated for the elderly population and measuring
the amount of proteinuria allow an estimation of renal function in elderly
patients with high accuracy. Chronic renal failure has many clinical consequences
and not only results in a delayed excretion of toxins cleared by the kidneys but 
also affects hematogenesis, water and electrolyte balance as well as mineral bone
metabolism. Furthermore, CKD directly leads to and aggravates geriatric syndromes
and in particular the onset of frailty. Therapeutic strategies to halt
progression of CKD not only comprise treatment of the underlying disease but also
efficient blood pressure and diabetic control and the avoidance of nephrotoxic
medications.

The recent epidemiologic data pointed out, that the general number of patients on
hemodialysis is steadily increasing, especially in group of elderly patients over
75 years old. The geriatric syndromes are a multietiological disorder related to 
physiological aging and partly associated with comorbid conditions. Frailty,
falls, functional decline and disability, cognitive impairment and depression are
main geriatric syndromes and occurs in patients with impaired renal function more
often than among general population. The causes of higher prevalence of those
syndromes are not well known, but uremic environment and overall renal
replacement therapy may have an important impact on its progress. The patient
with geriatric syndrome require comprehensive treatment as well as physical
rehabilitation, psychiatric cure and support in everyday activities. Herein below
we would like to review recent literature regarding to particular features of
main geriatric syndromes in a group of nephrological patients.

Antihypertensive treatment is aimed at reducing as much as possible health
outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. The main international guidelines
and clinical trials showed different positions about blood pressure targets. At
present, there is no common opinion about the benefits of an aggressive drug
treatment; moreover it is not clear whether lower blood pressure values are
related to increased morbidity and mortality. The recent randomized SPRINT trial 
has compared intensive vs standard drug therapy in a non-diabetic hypertensive
population. The trial has shown benefits of intensive treatment in reducing
important health outcomes, though results were not confirmed in several patient
subsets. We examined the studies on hypertensive patients with comorbidities
(i.e., chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) to identify blood pressure
targets recommended in these populations, but no strong evidence was found about 
the benefits of intensive treatment. In geriatric patients the "lower is better" 
paradigm cannot be entirely applied because of comorbidity, polypharmacy and
frailty.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

Mitochondria abnormalities in skeletal muscle may contribute to frailty and
sarcopenia, commonly present in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Dysfunctional mitochondria are also a major source of oxidative stress and may
contribute to cardiovascular disease in CKD We tested the hypothesis that
mitochondrial structure and function worsens with the severity of CKD
Mitochondrial volume density, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, BNIP3, and
PGC1α protein expression were evaluated in skeletal muscle biopsies obtained from
27 subjects (17 controls and 10 with CKD stage 5 on hemodialysis). We also
measured mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma 
isofurans, and plasma F2-isoprostanes in 208 subjects divided into three groups: 
non-CKD (eGFR>60 mL/min), CKD stage 3-4 (eGFR 60-15 mL/min), and CKD stage 5 (on 
hemodialysis). Muscle biopsies from patients with CKD stage 5 revealed lower
mitochondrial volume density, lower mtDNA copy number, and higher BNIP3 content
than controls. mtDNA copy number in PBMCs was decreased with increasing severity 
of CKD: non-CKD (6.48, 95% CI 4.49-8.46), CKD stage 3-4 (3.30, 95% CI 0.85-5.75, 
P = 0.048 vs. non-CKD), and CKD stage 5 (1.93, 95% CI 0.27-3.59, P = 0.001 vs.
non-CKD). Isofurans were higher in patients with CKD stage 5 (median 59.21 pg/mL,
IQR 41.76-95.36) compared to patients with non-CKD (median 49.95 pg/mL, IQR
27.88-83.46, P = 0.001), whereas F2-isoprostanes did not differ among groups.
Severity of CKD is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and markers of
oxidative stress. Mitochondrial abnormalities, which are common in skeletal
muscle from patients with CKD stage 5, may explain the muscle dysfunction
associated with frailty and sarcopenia in CKD Further studies are required to
evaluate mitochondrial function in vivo in patients with different CKD stages.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is widely prevalent worldwide, with a special impact
on elderly population. Around half of people aged over 75 meet diagnostic
criteria for CKD according to the recent 'Kidney disease improving global
outcomes' (KDIGO) 2012 clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and
management of CKD. However, geriatric patients have characteristics that may not 
be addressed by general guidelines. Therefore, it is important to know the
natural history of the disease, symptoms, and 'red-flags' that could help in the 
management of these patients. In this review, a complete approach is presented on
the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of CKD in the geriatric population.

Skeletal muscle mass and muscle function are negatively affected by a variety of 
conditions inherent to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to dialysis treatment.
Skeletal muscle mass and function serve as indicators of the nutritional and
clinical state of CKD patients, and low values or derangements over time are
strong predictors of poor patient outcomes. However, muscle size and function can
be affected by different factors, may decline at different rates, and may have
different patient implications. Therefore, operational definitions of frailty and
sarcopenia have emerged to encompass these 2 dimensions of muscle health, i.e.,
size and functionality. The aim of this review is to appraise available methods
for assessment of muscle mass and functionality, with an emphasis on their
accuracy in the setting of CKD patients. We then discuss the selection of
reference cutoffs for defining conditions of muscle wasting and dysfunction.
Finally, we review definitions applied in studies addressing sarcopenia and
frailty in CKD patients and discuss their applicability for diagnosis and
monitoring.

Real-world characteristics of hospitalized frail elderly patients with atrial
fibrillation: can we improve the current prescription of anticoagulants?

BACKGROUND: In elderly patients, especially those older than 80 years, atrial
fibrillation (AF) is associated with an almost 25% increased risk of stroke.
Stroke prophylaxis with anticoagulants is therefore highly recommended. The
prevalence of factors that have been associated with a lower rate of prescription
and adherence to anticoagulant therapy in these patients is little known. The
objective of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics of elderly
subjects, with and without AF, consecutively admitted to an acute geriatric unit,
discussing factors that may decrease the persistence on stroke prophylaxis
therapy. We also highlight possible strategies to overcome the barriers
conditioning the current underuse of oral anticoagulants in this segment of the
population.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed on a cohort of elderly
patients with and without AF admitted to the Acute Geriatric Unit of San Gerardo 
Hospital (Monza, Italy).
RESULTS: Compared to patients without AF (n = 1216), those with AF (n = 403) had 
a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (3 vs. 2, P < 0.001), number of administered 
drugs (4 vs. 3, P < 0.001), rate of heart failure (36.5% vs. 12%, P < 0.001) and 
chronic kidney disease (20.6 vs. 13.2, P < 0.001). Many patients with AF were
frail (54%) or pre-frail (29%).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with AF have higher rates of conditions that affect
adherence to traditional anticoagulant therapy (vitamin K antagonists, VKA). New 
direct oral anticoagulants (DOAs) can help overcome this problem. In order to
prescribe the most appropriate VKA or DOAs, with the best efficacy/safety profile
and the highest compliance, a comprehensive geriatric assessment should always

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with
destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial
cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However,
surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis
rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on
hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal
kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree
decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior
instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to
adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical 
motion.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising and is likely
to continue to do so for the foreseeable future, with the fastest growth seen
among adults ≥75 years of age. Elderly patients with advanced CKD are likely to
have a higher burden of comorbidity and frailty, both of which may influence
their disease outcome. For these patients, treatment decisions can be complex,
with the current lack of robust prognostic tools hindering the shared
decision-making process. The current study aims to assess the impact of
comorbidity and frailty on the outcomes of patients referred for pre-dialysis
education.
METHODS: We performed a single-centre study of patients (n = 283) referred for
pre-dialysis education between 2010 and 2012. The Charlson Comorbidity Index
(CCI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) were used to assess comorbid disease
burden and frailty, respectively. Follow-up data were collected until February
2015.
RESULTS: The CCI and CFS scores at the time of referral to the pre-dialysis
service were independent predictors of mortality. Within the study follow-up
period, 76% of patients with a high CFS score at the time of pre-dialysis
education had died, with 63% of these patients not commencing dialysis before
death.
CONCLUSION: A relatively simple frailty scale and comorbidity score could be used
to predict survival and better inform the shared decision-making process for
patients with advanced kidney disease.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement
can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light
chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies
have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We
evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in
France.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered
in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 
with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored
for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as
renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and 
causes of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334
(23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72
years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was
observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation
was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis,
67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were 
malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and
cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty 
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high
BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is
poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of
death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

The great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) are our closest
relatives. Despite the many similarities, there are significant differences in
aging among apes, including the human ape. Common to all are dental attrition,
periodontitis, tooth loss, osteopenia, and arthritis, although gout is uniquely
human and spondyloarthropathy is more prevalent in apes than humans. Humans are
more prone to frailty, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, longevity past reproductive
senescence, loss of brain volume, and Alzheimer dementia. Cerebral vascular
disease occurs in both humans and apes. Cardiovascular disease mortality
increases in aging humans and apes, but coronary atherosclerosis is the most
significant type in humans. In captive apes, idiopathic myocardial fibrosis and
cardiomyopathy predominate, with arteriosclerosis of intramural coronary
arteries. Similar cardiac lesions are occasionally seen in wild apes. Vascular
changes in heart and kidneys and aortic dissections in gorillas and bonobos
suggest that hypertension may be involved in pathogenesis. Chronic kidney disease
is common in elderly humans and some aging apes and is linked with cardiovascular
disease in orangutans. Neoplasms common to aging humans and apes include uterine 
leiomyomas in chimpanzees, but other tumors of elderly humans, such as breast,
prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers, are uncommon in apes. Among the apes,
chimpanzees have been best studied in laboratory settings, and more comparative
research is needed into the pathology of geriatric zoo-housed and wild apes.
Increasing longevity of humans and apes makes understanding aging processes and
diseases imperative for optimizing quality of life in all the ape species.

BACKGROUND: The dialysis population is aging worldwide. It is well known that
patients on dialysis have limited functional status, but only recently has
frailty been considered.
SUMMARY: The prevalence of frailty among patients on dialysis ranges from 3.4- to
10-fold higher than among community-dwelling elderly, depending on the method of 
assessing frailty and patient characteristics. Despite its high prevalence and
the high overall mortality in the dialysis population, frailty is associated with
higher mortality, independent of clinical and demographic characteristics and
comorbidity. The prevalence of frailty among patients with non-dialysis-dependent
chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also high, and cross-sectional data suggest that 
the prevalence may increase as CKD progresses. Thus, interventions to improve
frailty have the potential to improve quality of life and mortality. Although
interventions to improve physical dysfunction have been successful in the
population with end-stage renal disease, no studies have specifically targeted
frail individuals. Therefore, the extent to which exercise or physical activity
interventions are feasible among frail patients and can improve frailty urgently 
needs to be examined. In the meantime, providers should refer frail patients to
physical therapists and encourage them to be more active if possible. In
addition, more attention should be focused on the possibility that rehabilitation
among patients with earlier stages of CKD could improve dialysis outcomes.
KEY MESSAGES: Frailty is extremely common among patients on dialysis and is
independently associated with adverse outcomes. Providers should take advantage
of available resources to improve functioning in this population, and research
should address the optimal strategy for addressing frailty, including timing of
intervention.

Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of complexity, which is an
essential condition for making the organism capable of keeping homeostasis. Thus,
senile loss of complexity makes old individuals frail: a syndrome characterized
by the presence of shrinking (sarcopenia), weakness, poor endurance and energy,
slowness, and low physical activity. Moreover, renal ageing progressively leads
to a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction, one of the main pharmacokinetic 
senile changes, which is not detectable by simply evaluating serum urea or
creatinine values but measuring or calculating patient's GFR. Finally, current
epidemiology has documented that detrimental social-behavioral factors such as
low education level, poor financial-resource, depression, and isolation, also
influence the onset and progression of chronic diseases, and even overall
mortality, particularly in the elderly. Thus, we propose that these 3 variables: 
frailty phenotype, senile GFR, and detrimental social-behavioral factors, should 
be considered at time of prescribing drugs or medical procedures in the elderly. 
Additionally, they should also be considered for following patient's response to 
prescribed therapies in elderly patients suffering from chronic diseases
(diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, etc.), or on organ replacement
treatments (dialysis and transplantation).

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a
predictor of adverse outcomes. The current article reviews the most common
frailty measures available, gives an overview of their use in the chronic kidney 
disease population, and summarizes their strengths and limitations.
RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty is increasingly recognized as a potent predictor of
adverse outcomes in all stages of chronic kidney disease. Recent investigations
have demonstrated that the clinical perception of frailty by healthcare personnel
or patients themselves is an inaccurate measure of frailty. The clinical frailty 
scale, a simple point-of-care tool for the assessment of frailty, has been shown 
to be a predictor of mortality in individuals on dialysis.
SUMMARY: The Fried criteria have been most extensively used in chronic kidney
disease. However, other criteria using self-reported outcomes, clinical and
cognitive criteria have also been shown to predict adverse outcomes and may be
more applicable in clinical settings. Many of these still require further
validation in the chronic kidney disease population.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the
elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in
comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly
individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength,
body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and
endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined
outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were
assessed.
METHODS: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient
drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12
months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc
Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail
and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition
(DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years 
old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After 
some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30
to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; 
IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 
14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 
2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the 
casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that
frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney
disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either
worse endothelial function or mortality.

Stroke prevention in elderly atrial fibrillation patients remains a challenge.
There is a high risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism but also a high risk 
of bleeding if anticoagulants are prescribed. The elderly have increased chronic 
kidney disease, coronary artery disease, polypharmacy, and overall frailty. For
all these reasons, anticoagulant use is underutilized in the elderly. In this
manuscript, the benefits of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared
with warfarin in the elderly patient population with multiple comorbid conditions
are reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Frailty, a manifestation of unsuccessful aging, is highly prevalent
in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with comorbid
conditions in cross-sectional studies. Longitudinal studies investigating the
progression of frailty in those with advanced non-dialysis CKD are lacking.
OBJECTIVES: Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial (CanFIT). To
determine the natural history, prevalence of perceived and measured frailty and
its association with dialysis treatment choices and adverse outcomes in patients 
with advanced CKD.
DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study, designed to collect data from 600
participants over 2 years.
SETTING: Interprofessional non-dialysis CKD clinics at four tertiary health care 
centres in central Canada.
PATIENTS: People with CKD stage 4 and 5 (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) who are not
on dialysis at enrollment.
MEASUREMENTS: Multiple Frailty Definitions: Short Physical Performance Battery
(SPPB), Fried Frailty Criteria, Frailty Index. Dialysis start: In-Centre
Hemodialysis, Home Hemodialysis or Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes: Death, Opt-out
or Lost to follow up.
METHODS: We will perform physical and cognitive assessments annually. We plan to 
analyze the relationships between frailty, treatment choices and patient centered
outcomes.
RESULTS: We have recruited 217 participants in 2 centres; of these, 56 % had
reduced physical function at baseline, as defined by the SPPB. Risk of reduced
physical function was 8 fold higher in those with diabetes after adjusting for
age, gender, eGFR and comorbidities.
LIMITATIONS: Referred population, use of SPPB as a measure of frailty,
inter-operator variability in measurement of hand grip and gait speed,
cross-sectional analysis of baseline data in the subset recruited to date.
CONCLUSIONS: People with advanced CKD have a high burden of reduced physical
function, especially those with diabetes. We will continue enrollment into the
CanFIT study to further understand the clinical history of CKD and frailty in
this population.

AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to 
complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and
functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total
number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and
assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD
0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified
Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P =
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good
construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the
potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for
patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

BACKGROUND: The number of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease opting
for conservative management rather than dialysis is unknown but likely to be
growing as increasingly frail patients with advanced renal disease present to
renal services. Conservative kidney management includes ongoing medical input and
support from a multidisciplinary team. There is limited evidence concerning
patient and carer experience of this choice. This study will explore quality of
life, symptoms, cognition, frailty, performance decision making, costs and impact
on carers in people with advanced chronic kidney disease managed without dialysis
and is funded by the National Institute of Health Research in the UK.
METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, longitudinal study, patients will be
recruited in the UK, by renal research nurses, once they have made the decision
not to embark on dialysis. Carers will be asked to 'opt-in' with consent from
patients. The approach includes longitudinal quantitative surveys of quality of
life, symptoms, decision making and costs for patients and quality of life and
costs for carers, with questionnaires administered quarterly over 12 months.
Additionally, the decision making process will be explored via qualitative
interviews with renal physicians/clinical nurse specialists.
DISCUSSION: The study is designed to capture patient and carer profiles when
conservative kidney management is implemented, and understand trajectories of
care-receiving and care-giving with the aim of optimising palliative care for
this population. It will explore the interactions that lead to clinical care
decisions and the impact of these decisions on informal carers with the intention
of improving clinical outcomes for patients and the experiences of care givers.

It is known that the common physiological denominator of the ageing process is an
attenuation of functional performance with respect to the situation of young
people and adults. However, since the first cohort-based longitudinal studies, it
has not been possible to establish a "linear" relationship between age and
glomerular filtration in all cases. This does not mean that there is no
physiological ageing process at all; in addition to those already elucidated, its
mechanisms include cell senescence, podocyte dysfunction, a vitamin D deficiency,
and homozygotic forms of the MYH9 gene. The aim of the present work was to
analyse the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and, where possible, the
correlation between CKD, defined by an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), plasma
25(OH)D3 levels and the MYH9 gene in a population of elderly and very elderly
persons. These parameters have not been evaluated previously in populations of
elderly and very elderly patients. It is concluded that a moderate decrease in
the eGFR occurs with age. This does not imply the presence of CKD in elderly
people, since in most individuals the reduced eGFR is not accompanied by anaemia,
and no individuals show hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia or a high Alb/Cr ratio.
Here we observed a lower Hb level and an elevated Alb/Cr ratio in subjects
heterozygotic for the MYH9 gene. This could be interpreted in the sense that the 
gene could exert some protective effect on renal function, whereas the
heterozygotic form (allele A) of the MYH9 gene could be considered a very early
marker, a new risk factor for the appearance of CKD, or a sign of renal frailty
in elderly people.

BACKGROUND: Dental disease is more extensive in adults with chronic kidney
disease, but whether dental health and behaviors are associated with survival in 
the setting of hemodialysis is unknown.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multinational cohort.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,205 adults treated with long-term hemodialysis, 2010 to
2012 (Oral Diseases in Hemodialysis [ORAL-D] Study).
PREDICTORS: Dental health as assessed by a standardized dental examination using 
World Health Organization guidelines and personal oral care, including
edentulousness; decayed, missing, and filled teeth index; teeth brushing and
flossing; and dental health consultation.
OUTCOMES: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months after dental
assessment.
MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models
fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within
countries.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 22.1 months, 942 deaths occurred, including
477 cardiovascular deaths. Edentulousness (adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.51) 
and decayed, missing, or filled teeth score ≥ 14 (adjusted HR, 1.70; 95% CI,
1.33-2.17) were associated with early all-cause mortality, while dental flossing,
using mouthwash, brushing teeth daily, spending at least 2 minutes on oral
hygiene daily, changing a toothbrush at least every 3 months, and visiting a
dentist within the past 6 months (adjusted HRs of 0.52 [95% CI, 0.32-0.85], 0.79 
[95% CI, 0.64-0.97], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58-0.99], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-0.99], 0.79
[95% CI, 0.65-0.95], and 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.96], respectively) were associated 
with better survival. Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar.
LIMITATIONS: Convenience sample of clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: In adults treated with hemodialysis, poorer dental health was
associated with early death, whereas preventive dental health practices were
associated with longer survival.

BACKGROUND: The elderly form an expanding proportion of patients with chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide. The increased physiological
frailty and functional morbidity associated with the aging process pose unique
challenges when planning optimal management of an older patient needing renal
replacement therapy (RRT).
AIMS: This position paper discusses current evidence regarding the optimal
management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly with an emphasis on
hemodialysis since it is the most common modality used in older patients. Further
research is needed to define relevant patient-reported outcome measures for
end-stage renal disease including functional assessments and psychological
impacts of various forms of RRT. For those older patients who have opted for
dialysis treatment, it is important to study the strategies that encourage
greater uptake of home-based dialysis therapies and optimal vascular access.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of advanced chronic kidney disease in the elderly can
be challenging but also extremely rewarding. The key issue is adopting a
patient-focused and individualized approach that seeks to achieve the best
outcomes based on a comprehensive holistic assessment of what is important to the
patient.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older people, but it is
unclear if it affects survival and rehabilitation outcomes independent of
comorbid conditions and physical function in this population.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort analysis of prospective, routinely collected, linked
clinical data sets.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients discharged from a single inpatient geriatric
rehabilitation center over a 12-year period.
PREDICTORS: Admission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) category as a
predictor of improvement in the 20-point Barthel score (activities of daily
living measure) during rehabilitation; discharge eGFR category and Barthel score 
as predictors of survival postdischarge.
OUTCOMES: Survival postdischarge was modeled using Cox regression analyses,
unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, morbidities (ischemic heart disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, diabetes, and heart failure),
Barthel score and eGFR category on discharge, and serum calcium, hemoglobin, and 
albumin levels. The effect of admission eGFR category on change in Barthel score 
during admission was modeled using analysis of covariance, adjusted for
admission, Barthel score, and comorbid conditions.
RESULTS: 3,012 patients were included; mean age, 84 years. 2,394 patients died
during a mean follow-up of 8.3 years. Compared with patients with eGFR of 60 to
89mL/min/1.73m(2), adjusted HRs for death were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.13-1.40), 1.45
(95% CI, 1.29-1.63), and 1.68 (95% CI, 1.42-1.99) for eGFR categories of 45 to
59, 30 to 44, and <30mL/min/1.73m(2), respectively. The relationship between
discharge Barthel score and survival was similar within each discharge eGFR
category (HRs of 0.95, 0.93, 0.92, 0.95, and 0.90 per Barthel score point within 
eGFR categories of ≥90, 60-89, 45-59, 30-44, and <30mL/min/1.73m(2); P for
interaction = 0.2). Similar improvements in Barthel score between admission and
discharge were seen for each admission eGFR category.
LIMITATIONS: Single-center study using routinely collected clinical data.
CONCLUSIONS: eGFR category and Barthel score are independent risk markers for
survival in older rehabilitation patients, but advanced CKD does not preclude
successful rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition 
with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more
frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other
chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in
pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an
outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was
modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was
used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed 
using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.
RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were
significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those 
who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of
frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was
significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower
physical and mental quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in
pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential
role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of
life.

Are currently GFR estimating equations and standard Kt/V value adequate for
advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) frail elderly patients?

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) elderly patients have a reduced glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) due to the combination of ageing and chronic nephropathy
damage. This situation is very important to be taken into account in order to
prescribe an adequate medication and dialysis dose in this aged group. Besides,
cognitive and urinary incontinence problems make difficult to obtain an adequate 
24-h urine collection in order to evaluate creatinine clearance in this group.
Thus, a reliable GFR estimating equation would be very useful for assisting
elderly CKD patients. Additionally, Kt/V is the main parameter currently used for
dosing dialysis in stage V CKD young and elderly patients. However, frailty and
sarcopenia are prevalent disorders usually suffered by old people, who also
present many physiological changes that could make GFR estimating equations and
standard Kt/V value to become unreliable in this particular group. In conclusion,
based on all these facts, it seems crucial for clinical geriatric nephrology to
carefully evaluate how reliable current GFR estimating equations are, as well as 
which would be an adequate Kt/V value in CKD frail elderly patients.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

The identification of a patient at high risk of fracture should be followed by
evaluation for factors contributing to low bone mass, skeletal fragility, falls, 
and fractures. Components of the evaluation include a bone density test,
osteoporosis-directed medical history and physical exam, laboratory studies, and 
possibly skeletal imaging. A bone density test with dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) helps with diagnostic classification, assessment of fracture
risk, and provides a baseline for monitoring the skeletal effects of treatment.
FRAX is a fracture risk algorithm that includes input of femoral neck bone
mineral density measured by DXA. The DXA T-score and FRAX estimation of fracture 
risk are used with clinical practice guidelines to determine whether treatment is
indicated. The medical history may reveal underlying causes of osteoporosis
(e.g., nutritional deficiencies, gastric surgery, medications with adverse
skeletal effects) and important risk factors for fracture (e.g., past history of 
fracture, family history of osteoporosis, or recent falls). Physical exam may
show skeletal deformities due to unrecognized fractures (e.g., loss of height,
kyphosis, or diminished rib-pelvis space), identify possible secondary causes of 
skeletal fragility (e.g., blue sclera with osteogenesis imperfecta, urticarial
pigmentosa with systemic mastocytosis, or bone tenderness with osteomalacia), and
help to recognize patients with poor balance and frailty that might lead to
falls. Laboratory studies may show potentially reversible abnormalities (e.g.,
vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, or impaired kidney function) that must be
assessed and corrected, if possible, before starting pharmacological therapy.
Disorders other than osteoporosis, requiring other types of treatment, may be
found; for example, low serum alkaline phosphatase suggests hypophosphatasia,
M-component may be due to myeloma, or hypocalciuria due to celiac disease. There 
are important safety considerations that can be derived from a pre-treatment
assessment, as well. A patient with a blood clotting disorder should not be
treated with raloxifene, a history of esophageal stricture is a contraindication 
for oral bisphosphonates, and previous skeletal radiation therapy precludes
treatment with teriparatide. Skeletal imaging may be helpful when a fracture,
malignancy, or Paget’s disease of bone is suspected. Bone biopsy is rarely
performed in clinical practice, but may be helpful in some situations, such as
when it is necessary to determine the underlying bone disease in a patient with
stage 5 chronic kidney disease. For complete coverage of all related areas of

Body composition in chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and
nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney
disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia
are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here.
RECENT FINDINGS: The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among
the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The
association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD 
stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely
associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger
associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy
supplementation combined with low-protein diet for the management of CKD may
prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but
dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis 
therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum
bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23 mEq/l for
nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A
benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven.
SUMMARY: Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and
integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing
comorbidities.

A chronic disease in older adults usually runs a course that is less predictable 
than in younger individuals. Unexplained variations in disease incidence,
prognosis, therapeutic responses, and toxicity are frequently observed among
older adults. This heterogeneity poses huge challenges to the current
one-size-fits-all health care systems, and calls for more personalized
managements of chronic diseases in older adults. Aging is characterized by
progressive deterioration of bodily functions with increasing risk of failure
over time. The entire process is hierarchically organized, and progresses from
intracellular events to changes at systemic and ultimately organism levels at
different rates among different individuals. Aging biology exerts great
influences on the development and progression of most age-related chronic
diseases. Thus, aging biology could contribute to the complexity of illnesses
that increase with age, and aging biomarkers possess a great potential to enable 
personalized health risk assessment and health care. We review evidences
supporting the roles of aging biomarkers in risk assessment of prevalent
age-related diseases. Frailty phenotype is an objectively measured indicator of
advanced-stage aging that is characterized by organism-level dysfunction. In
contrast, altered inflammation markers level signifies an earlier stage between
cellular abnormalities and systems dysfunction. Results of human observational
studies and randomized controlled trials indicate that these measures, albeit
simple, greatly facilitate classification of older patients with cancer, chronic 
kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus into groups 
that vary in disease incidence, prognosis and therapeutic response/toxicity. As
the detailed mechanisms underlying the complex biologic process of aging are
unraveled in the future, a larger array of biomarkers that correlate with
biologic aging at different stages will be discovered. Following the
translational research framework described in this article, these research
efforts would result in innovations in disease prevention and management that
address the huge unmet health needs of aging populations.

Many observers have noted that the morphological changes that occur in chronic
kidney disease (CKD) patients resemble those seen in the geriatric population,
with strikingly similar morbidity and mortality profiles and rates of frailty in 
the two groups, and shared characteristics at a pathophysiological level
especially in respect to the changes seen in their vascular and immune systems.
However, whilst much has been documented about the shared physical
characteristics of aging and uremia, the molecular and cellular similarities
between the two have received less attention. In order to bridge this perceived
gap we have reviewed published research concerning the common molecular processes
seen in aging subjects and CKD patients, with specific attention to altered
proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, post-translational protein modification,
and senescence and telomere attrition. We have also sought to illustrate how the 
cell death and survival pathways apoptosis, necroptosis and autophagy are closely
interrelated, and how an understanding of these overlapping pathways is helpful
in order to appreciate the shared molecular basis behind the pathophysiology of
aging and uremia. This analysis revealed many common molecular characteristics
and showed similar patterns of cellular dysfunction. We conclude that the
accelerated aging seen in patients with CKD is underpinned at the molecular
level, and that a greater understanding of these molecular processes might
eventually lead to new much needed therapeutic strategies of benefit to patients 
with renal disease.

Nephroprevention strategies are crucial for handling chronic kidney disease (CKD)
complications, and slowing its progression. However, these preventative measures 
should be guided by major geriatrics principles in order to help nephrologists to
adequately handle the oldest old with CKD. These geriatric concepts consist of
taking into account the relevance of choosing an individualized therapy, handling
clinical frailty, and keeping a geriatric perspective which means that a good
quality of life is sometimes a more important therapeutic objective in
octogenarians than merely prolonging life. Even though nephroprevention
strategies for treating the oldest old with CKD are basically similar to those
applied to younger patients such as low sodium and protein diet, optimized
hemoglobin levels, blood pressure and metabolic control, the treating physician
or care provider must at all times be ready to make fundamental adjustments and
tweak patient care paradigms and objectives if and when the initial therapeutic
options applied have caused unintended clinical consequences and complications.
Additionally, the sarcopenia status should also be evaluated and treated in very 
old CKD patients.

Frailty, which is a geriatric syndrome characterized by weakness, impaired
mobility, balance, and minimal reserve, is highly prevalent in the renal
population. While distinct from disability and comorbidity, some of the simplest 
and most clinically useful scales incorporate both the burden of medical symptoms
and the effect on functional independence into the evaluation of frailty. In the 
renal population, the frailty phenotype has been shown to correlate with
important outcomes such as hospitalization and survival. Further work is required
to establish if the presence of, and the treatments used for renal disease,
promote the sick role and decreased participation in exercise with overestimation
of frailty or if the frailty phenotype identifies people who may benefit from
rehabilitation and other interventions.

BACKGROUND: Environmental lead and cadmium exposure is associated with higher
risk of several age-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease,
chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis. These diseases may lead to frailty, a
geriatric syndrome characterized by diminished physiologic reserve in multiple
systems with decreased ability to cope with acute stressors. However, no previous
study has evaluated the association between lead or cadmium exposure and frailty.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study among individuals aged ≥ 60 years who participated
in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and had either
blood lead (N=5272) or urine cadmium (N=4887) determinations. Frailty was
ascertained with a slight modification of the Fried criteria, so that individuals
meeting ≥ 3 of 5 pre-defined criteria (exhaustion, low body weight, low physical 
activity, weakness and slow walking speed), were considered as frail. The
association between lead and cadmium with frailty was evaluated using logistic
regression with adjustment for relevant confounders.
RESULTS: Median (intertertile range) concentrations of blood lead and urine
cadmium were 3.9 µg/dl (2.9-4.9) and 0.62 µg/l (0.41-0.91), respectively. The
prevalence of frailty was 7.1%. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence
interval) of frailty comparing the second and third to the lowest tertile of
blood lead were, respectively, 1.40 (0.96-2.04) and 1.75 (1.33-2.31). Lead
concentrations were also associated with the frequency of exhaustion, weakness
and slowness. The corresponding odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for cadmium
were, respectively, 0.97 (0.68-1.39) and 1.55 (1.03-2.32), but this association
did not hold after excluding participants with reduced glomerular filtration
rate: 0.70 (0.43-1.14) and 1.09 (0.56-2.11), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the US older adult population, blood lead but not urine cadmium
concentrations showed a direct dose-response relationship with frailty. These
findings support that lead exposure increases frailty in older adults.

Multi-MitraClip therapy for severe degenerative mitral regurgitation: "anchor"
technique for extremely flail segments.

In high-risk or inoperable patients, implantation of MitraClip for treatment of
severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR) from central (A2/P2 pathology,
EVEREST patient) is effective in reducing symptoms and improving functional
class. Extending the use of MitraClip to the non-EVEREST patient is of
considerable interest. MitraClip implantation for wide flail segments and
non-central MR is technically more challenging but represents an important and
highly prevalent subset of patients. We present a case of an 82-year-old male
referred to our institution for medically refractory primary MR. Trans-esophageal
echocardiogram demonstrated severe (4+) MR, annular dilatation, P3 > P2 mitral
valve prolapse, malcoaptation, and wide flail gaps and widths. The patient's age,
frailty, chronic kidney disease, and mild cognitive impairment rendered him a
candidate for MitraClip therapy. Our target area, the areas of maximum flail
(A3/P3), proved too wide for grasping. Hence, the first clip was deployed medial 
to the target area. Subsequent deployment, in a sequential fashion ("zipper
technique"), was not technically feasible due to persistent instability of the
target area. Consideration was given to an alternative approach by "anchoring"
our target area where the 2nd and 3rd clips were deployed lateral to the A3/P3
segment in efforts to "anchor" the maximum flail segment. This maneuver allowed
final clip deployment into a more stable target area. Subsequent imaging
demonstrated reduction in MR from 4+ to 1+ with preservation of a normal
transmitral gradient. We report the first successful US case of four MitraClip
implantation for the treatment of severe primary MR by "anchoring" flail
segments.

The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising, particularly
among the elderly population. Defining aging as successful or unsuccessful has
become clinically relevant in the last 15 years, with an increased recognition of
the frail phenotype. Frailty has been shown to be associated with CKD and poorer 
outcomes, such as death or dialysis. It is likely that the mechanisms of disease 
in CKD such as altered protein metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and
anemia accelerate normal aging and lead to worsening frailty in elderly patients 
with CKD.

In patients older than 75 years with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the
decision between treatment with dialysis [intention to treat with dialysis (ITD)]
or conservative care (CC) is a challenge. Geriatric assessment can be helpful.
The aim was to identify which factors had had an influence on
decision-making.METHODS: We recruited 56 patients. At baseline we analyzed age,
frailty (defined following the criteria of Fried et al. [J Gerontol A Biol Sci
Med Sci 2001;56:146-156]), dependence for activities of daily living (ADL),
cognitive impairment, depression, comorbidity, cardiovascular disease, and
diabetes. After full information about prognosis and treatment options, the
preferences of the patients and families were taken into consideration as
determinants in the decision-making process. During the follow-up, we evaluated
clinical and laboratory parameters, hospitalization, mortality and reevaluated
frailty.
RESULTS: Twenty patients opted for CC, and 36 patients opted for ITD. On
univariate analysis, the predictive factors of the election of CC were age,
prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and dependence for ADL. In the multivariate
analysis, age and prefrailty remained as predictors for the choice of CC.
Hospitalizations were more frequent in CC. Survival was similar in both groups (p
= 0.098).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessment could be useful for decision-making about the
treatment in elderly patients with CKD. CC may be a good treatment option.

131. Chronic Kidney Disease (Partial Update): Early Identification and Management of
Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults in Primary and Secondary Care.

The Renal National Service Framework (NSF), and the subsequent NICE Clinical
Practice Guideline for early identification and management of adults with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) in primary and secondary care (CG73), served to emphasise
the change in focus in renal medicine from treatment of established kidney
disease to earlier identification and prevention of kidney disease. CKD describes
abnormal kidney function and/or structure. It is common, frequently unrecognised 
and often coexists with other conditions (for example, cardiovascular disease and
diabetes). Moderate to severe CKD also carries an increased risk of other
significant adverse outcomes such acute kidney injury, falls, frailty and
mortality. The risk of developing CKD increases with increasing age, and some
conditions that coexist with CKD become more severe and increasingly prevalent as
kidney dysfunction advances. CKD can progress to end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD)in a small but significant percentage of people. CKD is usually
asymptomatic but it is detectable, and tests for detecting CKD are both simple
and freely available. There is evidence that treatment can prevent or delay the
progression of CKD, reduce or prevent the development of complications and reduce
the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, because of a lack of specific
symptoms, CKD frequently remains undetected and unrecognised. As a consequence
people with CKD are often not diagnosed, or diagnosed late when CKD is at an
advanced stage. Late diagnosis is associated with increased morbidity, mortality 
and healthcare associated costs.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with chronic kidney disease stage 5 may be offered a
choice between dialysis and conservative management. Few studies have explored
patients' reasons for choosing conservative management and none have compared the
views of those who have chosen different treatments across renal units.
STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative study with semistructured interviews.
SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: Patients 75 years or older recruited from 9 renal units.
Units were chosen to reflect variation in the scale of delivery of conservative
management.
METHODOLOGY: Semistructured interviews audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: 42 interviews were completed, 4 to 6 per renal unit. Patients were
sampled from those receiving dialysis, those preparing for dialysis, and those
choosing conservative management. 14 patients in each group were interviewed.
Patients who had chosen different treatments held varying beliefs about what
dialysis could offer. The information that patients reported receiving from
clinical staff differed between units. Patients from units with a more
established conservative management pathway were more aware of conservative
management, less often believed that dialysis would guarantee longevity, and more
often had discussed the future with staff. Some patients receiving conservative
management reported that they would have dialysis if they became unwell in the
future, indicating the conditional nature of their decision.
LIMITATIONS: Recruitment of older adults with frailty and comorbid conditions was
difficult and therefore transferability of findings to this population is
limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with chronic kidney disease stage 5 who have chosen
different treatment options have contrasting beliefs about the likely outcomes of
dialysis for those who are influenced by information provided by renal units.
Supporting renal staff in discussing conservative management as a valid
alternative to dialysis for a subset of patients will aid informed decision
making. There is a need for better evidence about conservative management to
support shared decision making for older people with chronic kidney failure.

Effect of advanced glycation end product intake on inflammation and aging: a
systematic review.

Aging is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory status that contributes
to chronic diseases such as age-related muscle wasting, kidney disease, and
diabetes mellitus. Since advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are known to be
proinflammatory, this systematic review examined the relation between the dietary
intake of AGEs and inflammatory processes. The PubMed and Web of Science
databases were screened systematically. Seventeen relevant studies in humans or
animals were included. The intervention studies in humans showed mainly a
decrease in inflammation in subjects on a low-AGE diet, while an increase in
inflammation in subjects on a high-AGE diet was less apparent. About half of the 
observational studies found a relationship between inflammatory processes and
AGEs in food. When the results are considered together, the dietary intake of
AGEs appears to be related to inflammatory status and the level of circulating
AGEs. Moreover, limiting AGE intake may lead to a decrease in inflammation and
chronic diseases related to inflammatory status. Most of the trials were
conducted in patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes, and thus
additional studies in healthy individuals are needed. Further investigation is
needed to elucidate the effects of lifetime exposure of dietary AGEs on aging and
health.

Frailty in the elderly is a state of vulnerability to poor resolution of
homoeostasis after a stressor event and is a consequence of cumulative decline in
many physiological systems during a lifetime. This cumulative decline depletes
homoeostatic reserves until minor stressor events trigger disproportionate
changes in health status. It is usually associated to adverse health outcomes and
to one-year mortality risk. Physical exercise has found to be effective in
preventing frailty and disability in this population. Chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is also a clinical condition where protein energy-wasting, sarcopenia and
dynapenia ,very common symptoms in the frail elderly, may occur. Moreover elderly
and CKD patients are both affected by an impaired physical performance that may
be reversed by physical exercise with an improvement of the survival rate. These 
similarities suggest that frailty may be a common pathway of aging and CKD that
may induce disability and that can be prevented by a multidimensional approach in
which physical exercise plays an important role.

[How to manage chronic kidney disease in the elderly?].

[Article in French]

From age 30 onwards, kidney function physiologically decreases although this
deterioration cannot yet be called chronic kidney disease. The latter appears in 
those exposed to cardiovascular risk factors associated with inflammation and
oxidative stress. A diffuse atherosclerosis then develops Patients with a
decreased glomerular filtration rate, especially below the threshold of 45
ml/min, are characterised by a poor physical heath and by cognitive disorders,
leading to frailty. In these conditions, a management strategy to reduce the
increased risk of acute kidney injury should be outlined and the need for renal
replacement therapy be considered. One must try to maintain the best possible
quality of life, promoting in some situations a conservative approach.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in 
individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on 
their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of
cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that
highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid
conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating
cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including
microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally,
studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected
in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with
worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk
of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible
short-term effects on markers of physical performance.
SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to 
better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

Frailty and quality of life: a cross-sectional study of Brazilian patients with
pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease.

Mansur HN, Colugnati FA, Grincenkov FR, Bastos MG.

PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces frailty and worsens quality of life
(QOL), even in the early stages of the disease and in young patients. However,
there is a lack of knowledge about the relationship between frailty and QOL in
CKD patients. Thus, we investigated this relationship in a sample of CKD
patients.
METHODS: A cross-observational study was conducted, in which 61 CKD patients
receiving pre-dialysis treatment were assessed. All participants completed the
Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used valid and reliable methods to
classify subjects as frail or non-frail according to Johansen's et al. (2007)
criteria. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used
to compare the groups. In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted
to measure associations between identified variables and frailty. We also
performed simple linear regression using the SF-36 physical and mental composite 
scores.
RESULTS: Almost half of the sample (42.6%) exhibited evidence of frailty. The
groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, and all SF-36 domains,
excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Frailty was significantly
associated with all SF-36 domains, again excluding Social Functioning and Role
Emotional. Regression analysis revealed no significant between-group differences 
in composite physical and mental health scores generated by the SF-36 (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Frail and non-frail CKD patients differed significantly in seven of
the eight SF-36 domains. The frail group displayed diminished physical and mental
functioning when their SF-36 scores were divided by their physical and mental
composite scores. Frailty was correlated with QOL domains, with the exception of 
the social domain. There is a need for interventions targeting the
characteristics of frailty, to provide better treatment and optimize overall QOL.

Current and emerging treatment options for the elderly patient with chronic
kidney disease.

The objective of this article is to review the current and emerging treatments of
CKD prior to dialysis in the elderly. Worldwide, there are increasing numbers of 
people who are aged over 65 years. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of
elderly patients presenting with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in
the more advanced stages. The elderly have quite different health care needs
related to their associated comorbidity, frailty, social isolation, poor
functional status, and cognitive decline. Clinical trials assessing treatments
for CKD have usually excluded patients older than 70-75 years; therefore, it is
difficult to translate current therapies recommended for younger patients with
CKD across to the elderly. Many elderly people with CKD progress to end-stage
kidney disease and face the dilemma of whether to undertake dialysis or accept a 
conservative approach supported by palliative care. This places pressure on the
patient, their family, and on health care resources. The clinical trajectory of
elderly CKD patients has in the past been unclear, but recent evidence suggests
that many patients over 75 years of age with multiple comorbidities have greatly 
reduced life expectancies and quality of life, even if they choose dialysis
treatment. Offering a conservative pathway supported by palliative care is a
reasonable option for some patients under these circumstances. The elderly person
who chooses to have dialysis will frequently have different requirements than
younger patients. Kidney transplantation can still result in improved life
expectancy and quality of life in the elderly, in carefully selected people.
There is a genuine need for the inclusion of the elderly in CKD clinical trials
in the future so we can produce evidence-based therapies for this group. In
addition, new therapies to treat and slow CKD progression are needed for all age 
groups.

BACKGROUND: Although dialysis prolongs life for patients with end-stage kidney
disease, 20% of deaths in this population are preceded by dialysis therapy
withdrawal. Recently, there has been more focus on conservative (nondialytic)
care as a legitimate option, particularly for elderly patients. This study aims
to describe patients' and caregivers' perspectives on conservative treatment and 
end-of-life care in chronic kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.
SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with CKD and caregivers.
SEARCH STRATEGY & SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and reference lists
were searched to May 2013.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the findings.
RESULTS: 26 studies involving more than 711 patients (non-dialysis dependent
[n=41], hemodialysis [n=544], peritoneal dialysis [n=9]; unspecified dialysis
modality [n=31], conservative management [n=86]) and 178 caregivers were
included. We identified 5 themes: invasive suffering (bodily deterioration, loss 
of freedom and independence, unyielding fatigue and pain, resignation, treatment 
burden and harm, financial strain), personal vulnerability (imminence of death,
misunderstanding and judgment, autonomy and dignity, medical abandonment, trust
and safety), relational responsibility (being a burden, demonstrating loyalty,
protecting others from grief), negotiating existential tensions (accepting
natural course of life, disrupted aging, worthlessness, living on borrowed time, 
respecting sanctity of life, life satisfaction, preserving self-identity), and
preparedness (decisional clarity, informational power, spirituality and hope).
LIMITATIONS: Non-English articles were excluded; therefore, the transferability
of findings to other populations is unclear.
CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with CKD experience physical and psychosocial frailty 
and feel ambivalent about prolonging life. Some caregivers believe in providing
relief from suffering, but are uncertain about making decisions regarding
dialysis therapy initiation and discontinuation. We suggest that CKD management
should encompass palliative care strategies that promote emotional resilience,
sense of well-being, and self-value. Also, respectful and attentive communication
may empower patients to convey their values and preferences about their own care.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical
function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness
and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a
heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of
this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general
population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science,
CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD
and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text
review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. 
From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in
patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with
increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. 
In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher 
risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished
physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may 
lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to
understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with
clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated
risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly
associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and
frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established.
METHODS: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test
of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of
frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting
for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for
the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty
status.
RESULTS: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49
(36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of
participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for 
eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61
points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all
comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p
= 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated with worse frailty
status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).
CONCLUSIONS: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and
frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD
patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted
interventions.

The association of physical activity and physical function with clinical outcomes
in adults with chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of
physical functioning and encouragement of physical activity in management of the 
patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), implementation has been undermined by 
a lack of understanding of the evidence for this recommendation. The purpose of
this review is to present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic
cohorts that report associations between low levels of physical functioning
and/or low physical activity and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Low levels of physical activity and poor physical functioning
are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical outcomes in adult
patients with CKD, regardless of treatment modality. Low physical performance and
activity limitations are more prevalent in patients with CKD, regardless of age, 
compared to older community-dwelling adults.
SUMMARY: The strength of the evidence presented should strongly motivate a focus 
of treatment on assessing and improving physical activity and physical function
as part of routine patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical
activity interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of
age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that is
similar to or higher than the general population of elderly adults; physical
activity, physical function, and performance are strongly associated with
all-cause mortality; and exercise training and exercise counseling have been
shown to improve measures of physical functioning.

Frailty is a physiologic state of increased vulnerability to stressors that
results from decreased physiologic reserves or dysregulation of multiple
physiologic systems. The construct of frailty has been operationalized as a
composite of poor physical function, exhaustion, low physical activity, and
weight loss. Several studies have now examined the prevalence of frailty among
chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and have 
found frailty to be more common among individuals with CKD than among those
without. Furthermore, frailty is associated with adverse outcomes among incident 
dialysis patients, including higher risk of hospitalization and death. Recent
evidence shows that frail patients are started on dialysis earlier (at a higher
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) on average than nonfrail patients,
but it remains unclear whether these patients' frailty is a result of uremia or
is independent of CKD. The survival disadvantage that has been associated with
early initiation of dialysis in observational studies could be mediated in part
through confounding on the basis of unmeasured frailty. However, available data
do not suggest improvement in frailty upon initiation of dialysis; rather, the
trajectory appears to be toward higher levels of dependence in activities of
daily living (ADLs) after dialysis initiation. Overall, there are no data to
suggest that frail patients derive any benefit from early initiation of dialysis 
either in the form of improved survival or functional status.

Evidence has recently been building that the presence of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is an independent contributor to decline in physical and cognitive
functions in older adults. CKD affects 45% of persons older than 70 years of age 
and can double the risk for physical impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and
frailty. To increase awareness of this relatively new concept of CKD as a risk
factor for accelerated aging, we review studies on the association of CKD with
physical function, frailty, and cognitive function. We also present a summary of 
the proposed mechanisms for these associations.

Bone fracture risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher
than that in healthy subjects. Frailty caused by neuromuscular impairment as well
as bone fragility due to bone loss and impaired bone quality is thought to be
involved in the elevated fracture risk in CKD. Altered material and structural
properties might be attributed to the reduced bone strength. The structural
properties in CKD patients are characterized in 1) cortical thinning and cortical
porosity, and 2) irregular thickening and loss of connectivity in trabecular
bone. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that skeletal changes in the
structural properties may be initiated at earlier stage of CKD than we expected.

Although sarcopenia is thought to underlie the manifestations of frailty,
association of frailty with measures of body composition is
underinvestigated.METHODS: Eighty hemodialysis patients were included in the
study. Performance-based frailty (PbF) used gait speed over 20 feet and 5
sit-to-stand (1 point each for lowest quintile) for the physical components of
the frailty phenotype plus exhaustion (Short Form-36 [SF-36] vitality score <55) 
and physical activity (lowest quintile of weekly kcal energy expenditure on
leisure activity on the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly questionnaire; 1 
point). Function-based frailty (FbF) defined by questionnaire measures of
physical functioning (SF-36 Physical Function score <75; 1 point), exhaustion,
and physical activity as for PbF. A score of 2 or greater was defined as frail.
Outcomes related to muscle size included muscle area of the contractile tissue of
the anterior tibialis and quadriceps muscles using magnetic resonance imaging,
phase angle using bioimpedance analysis, lean body mass using dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry, and body mass index (BMI). Linear regression was used to analyze 
associations between frailty and muscle size, with and without sex and age
covariates.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of individuals met PbF criteria, 63% met FbF
criteria, and 55% met both. In univariate analysis, PbF and FbF were associated
with smaller muscle area of the quadriceps, smaller phase angle, and higher BMI. 
Associations remained significant for the quadriceps after adjustment for age and
sex. The magnitude of association of PbF with quadriceps muscle area was greater 
than 10 years of age (-30.3 cm(2)P = .02 vs. -6.6 cm(2)P < .0001) in multivariate
analysis. There was no significant association between either measure of frailty 
and other measures of body composition after adjustment for age and sex.
CONCLUSION: Frailty was associated with measurements related to muscle size in a 
population of individuals with chronic kidney disease, a known contributor to
muscle wasting.

CKD is associated with impairments in health status, physical function, and
frailty. The aim of the current prospective cohort study was to determine whether
CKD predicted new LTCI need certification among community-dwelling older Japanese
adults. This was a prospective cohort study. We analyzed the cohort data from a
prospective study, The Japan Multicenter Aging Cohort for Care Prevention
(J-MACC). We followed 8063 elderly adults for 2 years, and we analyzed the
relationship between CKD and LTCI need. The outcome studied was new certification
for LTCI service need during a 2-year period. We measured serum creatinine (the
estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR), serum albumin, frailty checklist
scores, and body mass index. During the 2-year follow-up, 536 subjects (6.6%)
were newly certified as needing LTCI services. We stratified the cohort according
to eGFR quartile and performed multivariate analyses using an eGFR value of
71.4-83.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) as a reference. We found that subjects with eGFR
values <60.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) had a significantly elevated risk of LTCI service
need (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.44 [95% CI 1.12-1.86]). Our results indicate that 
CKD is independently associated with new LTCI service need certification and is
an important marker of frailty in older adults.

Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of
Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and
catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate
with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and
provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of
PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology
of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition)
due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent 
factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include
uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent
inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of
hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition,
comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the
dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor is
recommended for use as first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary
syndromes (ACS) who undergo high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention.
However, revascularization may not be a beneficial option for some subgroups of
patients with ACS. This includes a broad spectrum of lower risk patients as well 
as high-risk patients with numerous previous revascularizations and those who are
at high risk for complications, such as those with complex coronary anatomy and
co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or advanced age
and frailty. For such patients, there remains an unmet need for evaluation of
alternatives to the currently recommended treatment options. Notably, there is a 
paucity of prospective data regarding management approaches to medically managed 
patients with ACS. Thus, this group of medically managed patients with ACS would 
benefit from inclusion in clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for
patients not scheduled to undergo invasive procedures, such as those who are
targeted for pharmacologic management only. In conclusion, in this review, the
investigators revisit data from clinical studies of dual-antiplatelet therapy in 
ACS to highlight areas of unmet need in antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS
and to examine the use of newer agents in subgroups, such as medically managed
patients with ACS, that would potentially benefit from more potent platelet
inhibition after ACS.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the long-term outcomes after
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in the Multicenter Canadian
Experience study, with special focus on the causes and predictors of late
mortality and valve durability.
BACKGROUND: Very few data exist on the long-term outcomes associated with TAVI.
METHODS: This was a multicenter study including 339 patients considered to be
nonoperable or at very high surgical risk (mean age: 81 ± 8 years; Society of
Thoracic Surgeons score: 9.8 ± 6.4%) who underwent TAVI with a balloon-expandable
Edwards valve (transfemoral: 48%, transapical: 52%). Follow-up was available in
99% of the patients, and serial echocardiographic exams were evaluated in a
central echocardiography core laboratory.
RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 42 ± 15 months 188 patients (55.5%) had died. The
causes of late death (152 patients) were noncardiac (59.2%), cardiac (23.0%), and
unknown (17.8%). The predictors of late mortality were chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53 to
3.11), chronic kidney disease (HR: 1.08 for each decrease of 10 ml/min in
estimated glomerular filtration rate, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.19), chronic atrial
fibrillation (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.03), and frailty (HR: 1.52, 95% CI:
1.07 to 2.17). A mild nonclinically significant decrease in valve area occurred
at 2-year follow-up (p < 0.01), but no further reduction in valve area was
observed up to 4-year follow-up. No changes in residual aortic regurgitation and 
no cases of structural valve failure were observed during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-half of the patients who underwent TAVI because of
a high or prohibitive surgical risk profile had died at a mean follow-up of 3.5
years. Late mortality was due to noncardiac comorbidities in more than one-half
of patients. No clinically significant deterioration in valve function was
observed throughout the follow-up period.

Comment in
    Circulation. 2012 Oct 16;126(16):1937-8.

BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be
associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Given the high
prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD in the general population, in depth analysis
of this association is warranted.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We pooled individual participant data from 5 community-based
cohorts from Europe (second Nord-Trøndelag Health Study [HUNT2], Prevention of
Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease [PREVEND], and the Tromsø study) and the
United States (Atherosclerosis Risks in Communities [ARIC] and Cardiovascular
Health Study [CHS]) to assess the association of estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and CKD with objectively verified VTE. To estimate
adjusted hazard ratios for VTE, categorical and continuous spline models were fit
by using Cox regression with shared-frailty or random-effect meta-analysis. A
total of 1178 VTE events occurred over 599 453 person-years follow-up. Relative
to eGFR 100 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), hazard ratios for VTE were 1.29 (95% confidence
interval, 1.04-1.59) for eGFR 75, 1.31 (1.00-1.71) for eGFR 60, 1.82 (1.27-2.60) 
for eGFR 45, and 1.95 (1.26-3.01) for eGFR 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). In comparison
with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 5.0 mg/g, the hazard ratios for VTE 
were 1.34 (1.04-1.72) for ACR 30 mg/g, 1.60 (1.08-2.36) for ACR 300 mg/g, and
1.92 (1.19-3.09) for ACR 1000 mg/g. There was no interaction between clinical
categories of eGFR and ACR (P=0.20). The adjusted hazard ratio for CKD, defined
as eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or albuminuria ≥30 mg/g, (versus no CKD) was
1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.06). Associations were consistent in
subgroups according to age, sex, and comorbidities, and for unprovoked versus
provoked VTE, as well.
CONCLUSIONS: Both eGFR and ACR are independently associated with increased risk
of VTE in the general population, even across the normal eGFR and ACR ranges.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 
(KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation,
Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of
kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease
to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of
older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress
to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific
cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older
adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have
shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated 
with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis)
and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally
thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes 
include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research
studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD 
and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the
longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the
oldest old with CKD.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a physiological vulnerability status of the patient
which is associated with the increased number of hospitalization and death.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of frailty and its associated factors in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on conservative treatment (CT),
hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).
METHODS: Frailty was assessed in 146 patients (86 CT, 37 HD and 23 PD) and
characterized as muscle weakness and exhaustion--by the physical aspect and
vitality domains, respectively, evaluated in the SF-36 quality of life
instrument; physical inactivity--if he or she answered "never" or "hardly ever"
when asked about physical activity; and as unintentional weight loss (> 4.5 kg
per year). Patients were divided into three groups: non-fragile (NF), pre-fragile
(PF) and fragile (F). The demographic, clinical and laboratory data were
extracted from patient charts.
RESULTS: Frailty was diagnosed in 36% of patients on CT, 37.8% in HD and 47.8% in
PD. It was characterized in 36.8% of patients aged between 20 and 40 years and
40.3% of those between 41 and 60 years. Frailty was significantly associated with
the use of vitamin D (r = 0.16; p = 0.03), hemoglobin (r = -0.14; p = - 0.02) and
intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.16; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is common among patients with CKD on conservative treatment 
and dialysis, even in those who are not elderly. In the patients studied, the
phenotype of frailty was associated with no usage of vitamin D, lower serum
levels of hemoglobin and higher levels of parathyroid hormone.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced
functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing
the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the
CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or
evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based
cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study.
OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association
with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more
of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss,
exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum
cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to
relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was
51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much
older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components
were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes,
eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a
2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of
frailty compared with GFR(cys) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during 
a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was
associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or 
dialysis therapy.
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal
relationships between CKD and frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is
associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.

OBJECTIVE: Many older adults have decreased kidney function. Practitioners should
be informed that no single clinical assessment method is validated in predicting 
their kidney function.
DATA SOURCES: Primary literature identified through MEDLINE/PubMed (1950-2010)
and EMBASE (1980-2010) databases. The search was limited to English language,
human subjects, and individuals 65 years of age and older.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Research, review articles, and additional
publications related to geriatric, elderly, kidney function assessment, and
cystatin C.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Screening and diagnosing chronic kidney disease are a challenge
in older adults partially because of muscle loss and frailty. The various tools
used to estimate creatinine clearance (Clcr) are not validated and may lead to
under- or overdiagnosis of kidney function. The clinician must be cautious when
using and interpreting results from these values.
RESULTS: Estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with either the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) or Cockcroft-Gault (Clcr) formulae
yielded better predictions of kidney function when compared with creatinine
alone, or to measured Clcr. These estimation methods should be used in clinical
practice to provide a better estimation of kidney function in older adults until 
a more valid assessment tool becomes available.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no proven valid method for eGFR in older adults; however,
the CG and MDRD equations are routinely applied in clinical practice. Kidney
function assessment in older adults remains a challenge, and practitioners should
know their limitations.

Nephrologists worldwide are gradually coping with elderly patients. This is
because of the burden of chronic disease in the aging population and specifically
chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD in the elderly rarely occurs in isolation from 
other chronic conditions and can often be a marker of these conditions
themselves. Geriatricians usually take care of chronic conditions and are trained
to perform comprehensive geriatric assessment, a tool to estimate frailty, that
is the risk of adverse outcome, disability, and death in the clinical setting of 
elderly inpatients. Unfortunately, they are not used to a CHD invasive and
non-invasive approach and so there is no doubt about the need for a co-managed
care model for these patients. However, where and how this model must be realized
is still questionable. New hospital care models are patient-centered and
encompass the concepts of departments to embrace the differentiated levels of
care approach. According to this model the hospital is subdivided into three
different standards of care: 1-high; 2 -intermediate; 3- low and this
organization avoids inpatients being transferred frequently to different units,
receiving specific care easily obtained by moving and changing the medical staff 
in charge of the patient. The lean care approach integrates the principles of the
Toyota Producing System (TPS), a leading system of the industrial world, into
intensity-based hospital care, thereby maximizing quality processes and promoting
co-managed care as in the nephro-geriatric clinical setting.

Frailty is associated with a pro-inflammatory state, which has been characterized
by elevated levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers, but has not been related 
to the number of co-existing chronic diseases associated with inflammation. We
sought to determine the extent to which a higher number of inflammatory-related
diseases is associated with frailty and to identify the most common disease
patterns associated with being frail in older adults. We performed binomial
regression analyses to assess whether a higher count of inflammatory-related
diseases increases the probability of frailty using data from the WHAS I and II, 
companion cohorts composed of 70-79-year-old community-dwelling older women in
Baltimore, Maryland (n=620). An increase of one inflammatory-related disease was 
associated log-linearly with frailty (Prevalence Ratio (PR)=2.28, 95% Confidence 
Interval (CI)=1.81-2.87). After adjusting for age, race, education, and smoking
status, the probability of frailty remained significant (PR=1.97,
95%CI=1.52-2.55). In the frail population, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
depressive symptoms (Prevalence=22.9%, 95%CI=14.2-34.8%); CVD and depressive
symptoms (21.7%, 95%CI=13.2-33.5%); CKD and anemia (18.7%, 95%CI=11.1-29.7%);
cardiovascular disease (CVD), CKD, and pulmonary disease (10.7%,
95%CI=5.2-21.0%); CKD, anemia, and depressive symptoms (8.7%, 95%CI=3.9-18.2%);
and CVD, anemia, pulmonary disease, and depressive symptoms (5.0%,
95%CI=1.6-14.4%) were among the most frequent disease combinations. Their
prevalence percentages were significantly higher in the frail versus non-frail
women. A higher inflammatory-related disease count, perhaps reflecting a greater 
pro-inflammatory burden, increases the likelihood of frailty. Shared mechanisms
among specific disease combinations may further contribute to this risk.

therapy--is it always avoidable?

BACKGROUND: Twenty-five to 30% of new renal replacement therapy (RRT) patients
present late to renal services. The proportion in whom this is avoidable, and
whether awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has reduced its incidence is
not known.
METHODS: Adult patients starting RRT (2003-2008) in a single unit were grouped
according to the time interval between first presentation to the unit and start
of RRT: <90 days (late presenters); 90-364 days; ≥ 365 days. 'Late presenters'
were classified as follows: acute kidney injury--patients who had acute but
irreversible renal failure; 'avoidable' late referrals, if they had known
pre-existing CKD and 'unavoidable' late referrals, if they had unpredictable
rapid progression of their CKD or had no prior contact with health care.
Mortality risk associated with late presentation was explored using multivariable
Cox regression.
RESULTS: Late presentation was common (24.3%) but late referrals accounted for
only 7.4% and 3.9% were avoidable. The incidence of late referrals decreased from
9.2% in 2003-2005 to 5.5% in 2006-2008 (trend P = 0.07). Late presentation was
associated with increased mortality after adjusting for comorbidity,
transplantation and permanent vascular access, and the majority of late
presenters died due to malignancy or withdrawal of RRT.
CONCLUSIONS: The lower incidence of late referrals and the falling trend could be
due to implementation of automated estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting
and the increased awareness of CKD in primary care. Future prospective studies
are needed to examine the extent to which frailty contributes to this mortality
risk.

Following the expansion of dialysis services for patients with chronic kidney
disease, an increasing number of elderly patients with varying degrees of frailty
and additional comorbidities have been offered treatment. Life expectancy is
somewhat limited in this group of patients, and initiation of dialysis may not
necessarily improve quality of life. As such, an increasing number of centers are
offering conservative care for patients who have made an informed decision not to
have dialysis. As conservative care includes active treatment of anemia, volume
overload, blood pressure control, and management of uremic symptoms, including
pruritus, we term this approach as maximal conservative management of chronic
kidney disease. We describe our experience of maximum conservative management,
which although may not prolong life, can maintain the quality of life and
functional ability until the final illness in the majority of patients. Although 
these patients do not go to the hospital on a regular basis, coordinated support 
from the hospital, the community, and the care giver/relative is required for
successful care of the patient. Appropriate end of life planning can then be made
according to the wishes of the patient.

Thyroid hormone abnormalities and frailty in elderly patients with chronic kidney
disease: a hypothesis.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults,
affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are
encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap
with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder 
may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded
in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed 
to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is
being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization
and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low
testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of
whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly
CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In
this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone
abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with
CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors 
predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and
treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
importance.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the acute and late outcomes
of a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) program including both the
transfemoral (TF) and transapical (TA) approaches; and 2) to determine the
results of TAVI in patients deemed inoperable because of either porcelain aorta
or frailty.
BACKGROUND: Very few data exist on the results of a comprehensive TAVI program
including both TA and TF approaches for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis
in patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with the Edwards valve (Edwards 
Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, California) between January 2005 and June 2009 in 6
Canadian centers were included.
RESULTS: A total of 345 procedures (TF: 168, TA: 177) were performed in 339
patients. The predicted surgical mortality (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk
score) was 9.8 +/- 6.4%. The procedural success rate was 93.3%, and 30-day
mortality was 10.4% (TF: 9.5%, TA: 11.3%). After a median follow-up of 8 months
(25th to 75th interquartile range: 3 to 14 months) the mortality rate was 22.1%. 
The predictors of cumulative late mortality were peri-procedural sepsis (hazard
ratio [HR]: 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48 to 8.28) or need for
hemodynamic support (HR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.11 to 6), pulmonary hypertension (PH)
(HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR: 2.30, 95% CI:
1.38 to 3.84), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 1.75, 95%
CI: 1.09 to 2.83). Patients with either porcelain aorta (18%) or frailty (25%)
exhibited acute outcomes similar to the rest of the study population, and
porcelain aorta patients tended to have a better survival rate at 1-year
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: A TAVI program including both TF and TA approaches was associated
with comparable mortality as predicted by surgical risk calculators for the
treatment of patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk, including
porcelain aorta and frail patients. Baseline (PH, COPD, CKD) and peri-procedural 
(hemodynamic support, sepsis) factors but not the approach determined worse
outcomes.

Health-related quality of life outcomes in chronic kidney disease.

Pennsylvania 15213, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

A review of the effects of growth hormone changes on symptoms of frailty in the
elderly with chronic kidney disease.

The incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing
worldwide, especially in the elderly. Recently, functional impairment and frailty
have been recognized as factors affecting the quality of life, and outcomes in
elderly patients with CKD and therapeutic interventions to improve function and
reduce frailty are therefore being considered. Growth hormone (GH) levels
decrease with age and GH actions are impaired in CKD patients. GH stimulates
protein synthesis, bone, and glucose metabolism, and affects body composition by 
reducing body fat and increasing lean body mass. An increase in lean body mass
may reduce frailty and thus avoid functional impairment. Thus, providing GH to
elderly CKD patients could potentially improve outcomes and quality of life by
lowering the risk of frailty and associated functional impairment. There are few 
studies assessing the long-term effects of GH administration on symptoms of
frailty in elderly patients with CKD. In this review we will try to shed some
light on the trials assessing the administration of GH to elderly subjects and to
patients with CKD and focus on the possible role GH administration may play to
improve frailty and quality of life in those patients.

Older adults (aged >or=65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD
population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging.
Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the
frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among
vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical 
performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death.
Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits 
seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a
highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the
trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed 
to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to
identify opportunities to intervene.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney
disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated
criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to 
determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were
associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the
association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly
increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for
the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds 
of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation,
vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and
chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney
disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.
Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection
remain elusive.

Dedicated European and US clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes in the elderly 
have been released, but they do not specifically address the issue of advanced
chronic kidney disease (CKD) in older patients with diabetes. General clinical
guidelines have been published on the treatment of patients with diabetic
nephropathy (DN), but these address the issue of how to prevent progression and
treat advanced DN without distinguishing between different age groups. Elderly
patients with diabetes and stages 3 to 4 CKD have particular needs that differ
from those of younger patients with the same conditions. This is mainly due to
their frailty and shorter life expectancy. Differently tailored therapeutic
strategies are needed, which may have less stringent targets; and the use of
common drugs should be critically evaluated. The management agenda (metabolic
control, low-protein diet, controlling BP, preventing progression of advanced DN,
preventing cardiovascular outcomes) for these patients is discussed in light of
the limits and perspectives of current guidelines. Intensive, simultaneous
management of all items on the agenda may not be feasible for a proportion of
older patients, and clinicians may have to give priority to reducing some risk
factors rather than others, choosing between different therapies.

New advances in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) change the
perspective from which many of its features and treatment are viewed. Calcium,
phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D have been shown to be
important determinants of survival associated with kidney diseases. Now ROD
dependent and independent of these factors is linked to survival more than just
skeletal frailty. This review focuses on recent discoveries that renal injury
impairs skeletal anabolism decreasing the osteoblast compartment of the skeleton 
and consequent bone formation. This discovery and the discovery that PTH
regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche alters our view of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) from that of a disease to
that of a necessary adaptation to renal injury that goes awry. Furthermore, ROD
is shown to be an underappreciated factor in the level of the serum phosphorus in
CKD. The discovery and the elucidation of the mechanism of hyperphosphatemia as a
cardiovascular risk in CKD change the view of ROD. It is now recognized as more
than a skeletal disorder, it is an important component of the mortality of CKD
that can be treated.

Anemia, defined as a lower than normal level of serum hemoglobin, is a common
condition among the elderly, and it is often attributed to normal consequences of
aging. Anemia in older individuals is frequently undiagnosed and untreated. The
impact of untreated anemia can be severe, including increased risk of death, loss
of independent functioning, physical decline, falls and fractures, frailty,
cognitive decline, cardiovascular events and added economic burden to society.
Treatment is available for many types of anemia. For anemia caused by nutritional
deficiencies, treatments include simple dietary modifications and/or iron
supplementation (e.g., iron, vitamin B12 or folate). Transfusion or
erythropoietic agents (e.g., epoetin alfa, epoetin beta and darbepoetin alfa) are
used for anemia of chronic diseases and their treatments (e.g.,
cancer/chemotherapy and chronic kidney disease). Evidence that highlights the
benefits of erythropoietic therapies and their use in the treatment of anemia of 
chronic disease in the elderly is reviewed in this article.

This study investigated mortality in 568 individuals from the Goessel Mennonite
community in rural central Kansas. There were three main objectives to this
research: 1) characterize mortality trends within a biologically well-defined
Mennonite community; 2) determine what biochemical, morphological, and
physiological risk factors could be related to all-cause mortality, stratified by
age and sex; and 3) compare these results to previously described variables that 
were associated with both biological age and mortality in this population.
Mortality data were obtained from three sources: Kansas Vital Records, the Social
Security death index, and church records. In total, 221 (39%) individuals were
found to have died in this population between January 1980-June 2002. Analogous
to the larger US population, the three leading causes of death in this community 
were heart disease, cancer, and stroke, accounting for 60% of all deaths. Besides
advancing age, the greatest biological risk factor in this population was
decreased amounts of albumin in men (relative risk, 2.47), potentially indicating
underreported cases of either chronic kidney disease or frailty syndrome for
males. Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated that increased amounts of
total cholesterol may provide a protective effect for elderly individuals. We
conclude, based on the previously described heritability of both albumin (h(2) = 
0.40) and total cholesterol (h(2) = 0.50) in this population, that underlying
genetic factors associated with both chronic degenerative diseases and biological
aging may have important implications for understanding mortality patterns in
this community.
