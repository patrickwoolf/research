Background: Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are
mostly elderly patients with substantial comorbidities. Established risk scores
are not validated for TAVR and collectives with elderly patients making
periprocedural risk stratification difficult. Serum albumin is known to be an
indicator for malnutrition and frailty and is simple to measure, independent of
physician's bias. Using serum albumin as a preoperative marker for postoperative 
complications might help estimating morbidity and mortality of these patients.
Methods: A total of 457 patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis
undergoing TAVR at our institution in a period from January 2014 to December 2015
were included in this retrospective study. Baseline characteristics as well as
preoperative laboratory parameters were registered. Postoperative morbidity and
30-day mortality were analyzed as primary end points. Enrolled patients with
preoperative low serum albumin (<3.5 g/dL) were compared with those revealing
normal serum albumin (≥3.5 g/dL).
Results: Among 457 patients, 51 (11%) presented pre-procedural low serum albumin 
and 406 (89%) had normal serum albumin. Patients' mean age was 81±6 years and 50%
of them were male. Postoperative complications such as requirement of blood
transfusions (63% versus 33%, P<0.001), infection (53% versus 24%, P<0.001),
acute kidney injury (41% versus 19%, P=0.001) and 30-day mortality (10% versus
3%, P=0.045) showed significant differences between preoperative low and normal
albumin groups.
Conclusions: Preoperative low serum albumin might be an indicator for higher
morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing TAVR.

Diabetes mellitus affects over 20% of people aged > 65 years. With the population
of older people living with diabetes growing, the condition may be only one of a 
number of significant comorbidities that increases the complexity of their care, 
reduces functional status and inhibits their ability to self-care. Coexisting
comorbidities may compete for the attention of the patient and their healthcare
team, and therapies to manage comorbidities may adversely affect a person's
diabetes. The presence of renal or liver disease reduces the types of
antihyperglycemic therapies available for use. As a result, insulin and
sulfonylurea-based therapies may have to be used, but with caution. There may be 
a growing role for sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in
diabetic renal disease and for glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 therapy in renal and
liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). Cancer treatments pose considerable
challenges in glucose therapy, especially the use of cyclical chemotherapy or
glucocorticoids, and cyclical antihyperglycemic regimens may be required.
Clinical trials of glucose lowering show reductions in microvascular and, to a
lesser extent, cardiovascular complications of diabetes, but these benefits take 
many years to accrue, and evidence specifically in older people is lacking.
Guidelines recognize that clinicians managing patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus need to be mindful of comorbidity, particularly the risks of
hypoglycemia, and ensure that patient-centered therapeutic management of diabetes
is offered. Targets for glucose control need to be carefully considered in the
context of comorbidity, life expectancy, quality of life, and patient wishes and 
expectations. This review discusses the role of chronic kidney disease, chronic
liver disease, cancer, severe mental illness, ischemic heart disease, and frailty
as comorbidities in the therapeutic management of hyperglycemia in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus.

BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been presented regarding influence of body
mass index (BMI) on outcomes among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve
implantation (TAVI).
AIMS: To investigate impact of the BMI on the clinical results after TAVI.
METHODS: A total of 148 consecutive patients were categorized using baseline BMI 
according to World Health Organization criteria. The baseline patient
characteristics, frailty, procedural and clinical outcomes with 30 days and
12-month all-cause mortality were compared between BMI categories. Patients were 
followed-up for a median of 460.0 (182.0-1042.0) days.
RESULTS: Obesity was diagnosed in 37 (25.2%) patients, 73 were overweight
(49.7%), and 37 (25.2%) had normal weight. Lower frailty prevalence as assessed
with 5-meter walking test was confirmed in obese patients as compared to other
groups. A trend towards a lower rate of in-hospital bleeding complications [18
(48.6%) vs. 21 (28.8%) vs. 9 (24.3%); p = 0.06] and less frequent blood
transfusions in overweight and obese was observed [18 (48.6%) vs. 17 [23.3%) vs. 
8 (21.6%); p = 0.016]. The rate of grade 3 acute kidney injury was the lowest in 
the overweight group [4 (10.8%) vs. 1 (1.4%) vs. 3 (8.1%); p = 0.05]. There was
no difference between groups in all-cause mortality at 30 days (p = 0.15).
However, 12-month all-cause mortality was the lowest in obese patients [12
(32.4%) vs. 10 (13.7%) vs. 2 (5.4%); p = 0.004]. Increase in BMI was
independently associated with lower all-cause mortality [HR (95%CI) per 1 kg/m²
increase: 0.91 (0.845-0.98); p = 0.018].
CONCLUSIONS: Increased BMI was independently associated with survival benefit
after TAVI.

Motor functions are deteriorated by aging. Some conditions may magnify this
deterioration. This study examined whether hemodialysis (HD) process would
negatively impact gait and balance beyond diabetes condition among mid-age adults
(48⁻64 years) and older adults (65+ years). One hundred and ninety-six subjects
(age = 66.2 ± 9.1 years, body-mass-index = 30.1 ± 6.4 kg/m², female = 56%) in 5
groups were recruited: mid-age adults with diabetes undergoing HD (Mid-age HD+, n
= 38) and without HD (Mid-age HD-, n = 40); older adults with diabetes undergoing
HD (Older HD+, n = 36) and without HD (Older HD-, n = 37); and non-diabetic older
adults (Older DM-, n = 45). Gait parameters (stride velocity, stride length, gait
cycle time, and double support) and balance parameters (ankle, hip, and center of
mass sways) were quantified using validated wearable platforms. Groups with
diabetes had overall poorer gait and balance compared to the non-diabetic group
(p < 0.050). Among people with diabetes, HD+ had significantly worsened gait and 
balance when comparing to HD- (Cohen's effect size d = 0.63⁻2.32, p < 0.050).
Between-group difference was more pronounced among older adults with the largest 
effect size observed for stride length (d = 2.32, p < 0.001). Results suggested
that deterioration in normalized gait speed among HD+ was negatively correlated
with age (r = -0.404, p < 0.001), while this correlation was diminished among
HD-. Interestingly, results also suggested that poor gait among Older HD- is
related to poor ankle stability, while no correlation was observed between poor
ankle stability and poor gait among Older HD+. Using objective assessments,
results confirmed that the presence of diabetes can deteriorate gait and balance,
and this deterioration can be magnified by HD process. Among HD- people with
diabetes, poor ankle stability described poor gait. However, among people with
diabetes undergoing HD, age was a dominate factor describing poor gait
irrespective of static balance. Results also suggested feasibility of using
wearable platforms to quantify motor performance during routine dialysis clinic
visit. These objective assessments may assist in identifying early deterioration 
in motor function, which in turn may promote timely intervention.

Early outcomes of cardiac surgery in elderly patients.

Mzoughi K, Zairi I, Daly M, Ziadi J, Kamoun S, Ben Moussa F, Fennira S, Kraiem S.

BACKGROUND: Due to the increase in average life expectancy and the higher
incidence of cardiovascular disease, more elderly patients present for cardiac
surgery nowadays. At the same time, age has been considered a predictor of
morbidity and mortality.
AIM: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of cardiac surgery in elderly patients.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive retrospective study including elderly
patients who underwent cardiac surgery from January 2012 to 31st of December
2016. All patients were hospitalized before and after cardiac surgery in the
cardiology department of Habib Thameur Hospital.
RESULTS: Our study included 55 patients. Average age was 72±6 years old and
sex-ratio was two. Eighty-five percent presented with angina, 18% with dyspnea
and one patient with an aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis. Mean left
ventricular function was 54 ±9 %. Mean EuroSCORE II was 1.91±1.18. Twenty-six
per-cent had an urgent surgery. Mean extracorporeal circulation time was of 77±26
min and mean extubation time was 8±6 h. Eighty-four per cent had a coronary
artery bybass grafting and 16% a valve replacement. Four per cent had a redux and
4% a combined surgery. Stay in surgical department varied between 3 and 10 days
with average of 4.6±1.2 days. Early mortality rate was of 2% and 98% had
complications. Ninety-eight complications occurred after surgery: 35
reintervention for mediastinal bleeding or tamponade, 28 bleedings requiring
transfusions, eight heart rhythm disorders, an atrioventricular conduction block 
requiring ventricular, five atrial fibrillation, two ventricular tachycardias, a 
ventricular fibrillation, eight low cardiac outpout, seven prolonged mechanical
ventilation and eight pneumonias. In univariate analysis, recent myocardial
infarction and chronic kidney disease were predictive of early complications.
CONCLUSION: Our data shows cardiac surgery is feasible in elderly patients with
acceptable risk in terms of mortality and an increased morbidity due to their
frailty. Careful patient selection is needed for the success of cardiac surgery
in elderly patients.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 2% to 4% of patients with
severe aortic stenosis. It is because these patients have been excluded from
clinical trials, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in 
this patient group has not been thoroughly investigated. Between April 2008 and
March 2015, 2,000 patients (dialysis group, n = 56 [2.8%]) were consecutively
enrolled when diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and eligible to undergo TAVI.
Procedural and longer-term outcomes were analyzed and adjusted for differences in
baseline characteristics. Patients on dialysis had a higher periprocedural
mortality (10.7% vs 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 5.65, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.91 to 16.67; p = 0.002) and a lower Valve Academic Research
Consortium (VARC)-II (VARC) defined device success (adjOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to
0.79; p = 0.012). At 30 days, there was an increased rate of all-cause mortality 
(21.4 vs 4.8%; adjOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.96 to 12.26; p = 0.001), cardiovascular
(adjOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.41; p = 0.007) and noncardiovascular mortality
(adjOR 6.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 9.41; p = 0.019), myocardial infarction (adjOR 9.39, 
95% CI 1.84 to 48.03; p = 0.007), bleeding (adjOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.83;
p = 0.036) as well as the VARC-II defined early safety combined end point (adjOR 
2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.90; p = 0.012) associated with dialysis. Dialysis was
associated with poor survival at one (57.1% vs 84.2%) and 3 years (26.8% vs
66.9%) with or without the consideration of the first 72 hours (p <0.001;
adjusted p <0.001). Although, in the multivariable regression analysis, reduced
ejection fraction, peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH),
frailty and dialysis were associated with 1-year mortality, only PH (>60 mm Hg)
remained significant in an analysis restricted to the dialysis patients (adjusted
hazard ratio 2.68; 95% CI 1.18 to 5.88; p = 0.018). PH had a sensitivity of
45.8%, a specificity of 81.3%, and a positive predictive value of 64.7%. In
conclusion, dialysis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who
underwent TAVI. Long-term mortality in dialysis patients appears to be largely
determined by the kidney disease and/or dialysis itself whereas VARC-II defined
complications are largely unaffected. An increased short-term mortality still
calls for (pre-) procedural optimization.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects 10%-15% of the population, associates
with a range of complications-such as cardiovascular disease, frailty,
infections, muscle and bone disorders and premature ageing-that could be related 
to alterations of mitochondrial number, distribution, structure and function. As 
mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetics and the dynamic mitochondrial networks
directly or indirectly regulate numerous intra- and extracellular functions, the 
mitochondria have emerged as an important target for interventions aiming at
preventing or improving the treatment of complications in CKD. In this review, we
discuss the possible role of bioactive food compounds and exercise in the
modulation of the disturbed mitochondrial function in a uraemic milieu.

BACKGROUND: We retrospectively assessed the initial clinical role of preoperative
frailty in surgical patients with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD).
METHODS: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients who underwent emergent or 
urgent surgical interventions for AAAD in our institute between April 2000 and
March 2016 participated in this retrospective study. Patients with more than
three of the following six modalities were defined as being frail: age older than
75 years, preoperative requirement of assistance in daily living, body mass index
less than 18.5 kg/m2, female, history of major stroke, and chronic kidney disease
greater than class 3b. Twenty-three patients (20.2%) were diagnosed with frailty 
(group F), while 91 patients (79.8%) were not (group N). Early clinical outcomes,
major postoperative complications, postoperative recovery of activity, and early 
or mid-term survival were evaluated.
RESULTS: Although early clinical outcomes and the prevalence of major
postoperative complications were similar in both groups, postoperative activity
of daily living (ADL), such as the rate of being ambulatory on discharge
(p < 0.05) and home discharge (p < 0.01), was significantly lower in group F than
in group N. A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 1- and 5-year survival rates
were similar in groups F (85.9 and 76.4%, respectively) and N (86.0 and 76.9%,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative frailty in AAAD surgical patients has potential as a
prognostic factor that affects delays in ADL recovery, but does not influence the
early or mid-term clinical outcomes of prompt surgical strategies for life rescue
in AAAD patients with frailty.

Currently, there are no tools to predict postsurgery outcome after kidney
transplantation. This study assesses whether frailty influence 30-day
postoperative complications after kidney transplantation. One-hundred and fifty
kidney transplantations were prospectively included. Frailty was assessed using a
frailty indicator, consisting of 15 questions, covering most domains of
functioning. Postoperative complications were measured by the Comprehensive
Complication Index (CCI). Using a linear regression model, 30-day postoperative
complications and frailty correlation were adjusted for confounders, including
sex, age, ASA Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, BMI, smoking,
dialysis, duration of dialysis, type of transplantation, and retransplantation.
The mean frailty score was 2.07(±1.6) and 23 patients were classified as frail
(GFI ≥4). The mean CCI-score was 18(±15.6), the mean CCI-score for "frail"
patients 30.1(±17.2) compared to 15.5 (±14.2) for "non-frail" patients (N = 116).
In a regression analysis, a significant relationship between CCI-score and
frailty (β = 13.3; 95% CI 5.7-20.9; P = 0.0007) and transplantation type (β =
4.9; 95% CI: 0.72-9.16; P = 0.02) was found, independent of confounders. In
conclusion, frailty and type of transplantation are independent factors
associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications.

BACKGROUND: There is limited data on hospital readmissions following
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aim of this study was to
investigate hospital readmissions post-TAVI.
METHODS: Data from the Optimized transCathEter vAlvular iNtervention (OCEAN-TAVI)
multicenter registry (registration no. UMIN000020423) were collected from 1215
patients who underwent TAVI. Incidence, timing, causes, and predictors of
readmission in addition to the impact on patient outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 1215 patients, 223 (18.4%) were readmitted within 1 year post-TAVI.
Early readmission (≤30 days) occurred in 42 patients, while late readmission
(>30 days) occurred in 181 patients. Readmissions were due to cardiac disorders, 
such as heart failure and arrhythmia, in 77 patients and non-cardiac disorders,
such as respiratory disorders, infections, and cerebrovascular events, in 146
patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that early readmission was associated
with a lower 1-year survival compared to non-early readmission (72.4% vs. 89.0%, 
p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that acute kidney injury
(hazard ratio [HR], 2.27; p = 0.03) was an independent predictor of early
readmission, while anemia (HR, 2.21; p < 0.01), hypoalbuminemia (HR, 1.37;
p = 0.04), atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.70; p < 0.01), and more than mild
postprocedural aortic regurgitation (HR, 1.62; p < 0.01) were independent
predictors of late readmission.
CONCLUSION: Readmission occurred in approximately one-fifth of patients post-TAVI
and was associated with poor patient outcomes. Early readmission was mainly due
to procedural complications, while late readmission was mainly determined by
baseline comorbidities including a frailty criterion. Measures should be taken to
reduce hospital readmissions and improve patient outcomes post-TAVI.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Withdrawal from maintenance hemodialysis before death 
has become more common because of high disease and treatment burden. The study
objective was to identify patient factors and examine the terminal course
associated with hemodialysis withdrawal, and assess patterns of palliative care
involvement before death among patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We designed an observational
cohort study of adult patients on incident hemodialysis in a midwestern United
States tertiary center, from January 2001 to November 2013, with death events
through to November 2015. Logistic regression models evaluated associations
between patient characteristics and withdrawal status and palliative care service
utilization.
RESULTS: Among 1226 patients, 536 died and 262 (49% of 536) withdrew. A random
sample (10%; 52 out of 536) review of Death Notification Forms revealed 73%
sensitivity for withdrawal. Risk factors for withdrawal before death included
older age, white race, palliative care consultation within 6 months,
hospitalization within 30 days, cerebrovascular disease, and no coronary artery
disease. Most withdrawal decisions were made by patients (60%) or a family member
(33%; surrogates). The majority withdrew either because of acute medical
complications (51%) or failure to thrive/frailty (22%). After withdrawal, median 
time to death was 7 days (interquartile range, 4-11). In-hospital deaths were
less common in the withdrawal group (34% versus 46% nonwithdrawal, P=0.003). A
third (34%; 90 out of 262) of those that withdrew received palliative care
services. Palliative care consultation in the withdrawal group was associated
with longer hemodialysis duration (odds ratio, 1.19 per year; 95% confidence
interval, 1.10 to 1.3; P<0.001), hospitalization within 30 days of death (odds
ratio, 5.78; 95% confidence interval, 2.62 to 12.73; P<0.001), and death in
hospital (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 3.27; P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study, the rate of hemodialysis withdrawals
were twice the frequency previously described. Acute medical complications and
frailty appeared to be driving factors. However, palliative care services were
used in only a minority of patients.

Depression and Physical Frailty Have Additive Effect on the Nutritional Status
and Clinical Outcome of Chinese Peritoneal Dialysis.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frailty and depression both contribute to malnutrition and
adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, their
interaction is incompletely defined.
METHODS: We studied 178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed 
by a validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by the
Geriatric Depression Scale; nutritional status was determined by subjective
global assessment (SGA) and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS). All patients
were followed for up to 24 months for survival and hospitalization analysis.
RESULTS: There were 111 patients (62.4%) physically frail, amongst those 48
(43.2%) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without
frailty. There was an additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty
on nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty, frail but no depressive
symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin decreased in a
stepwise manner (35.8 ± 5.6, 34.9 ± 4.4, and 32.9 ± 5.3 g/L, respectively,
p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 ± 0.61, 5.41 ± 0.59, and 5.04 ± 0.77,
respectively (p< 0.0001), and MIS was 5.12 ± 2.30, 7.13 ± 3.22, and 9.48 ± 3.97, 
respectively (p< 0.0001). At 24 months, patient survival was 86.6%, 71.4%, and
62.5% for patients with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail
with depressive symptoms, respective (p=0.001). The median number of hospital
stay was 8.04 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.91 - 19.42), 14.05 (IQR 3.57 -
37.27), and 26.62 (IQR 10.65 - 61.18) days per year of follow up, respectively
(p< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Physical frailty and depressive symptoms are both common in Chinese
PD patients, and they have additive adverse effect on the nutritional status and 
clinical outcome.

BACKGROUND: Symptomatic aortic stenosis has a poor prognosis. Many patients are
considered inoperable or at high surgical risk for surgical aortic valve
replacement (SAVR), reflecting their age, comorbidities and frailty. The clinical
effectiveness and safety of TAVI have not been reviewed systematically for these 
high levels of surgical risk. This systematic review compares mortality and other
important clinical outcomes up to 5 years post treatment following TAVI or other 
treatment in these risk groups.
METHODS: A systematic review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database
(CRD42016048396). The Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination
Databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ZETOC were searched from January 2002 to August
2016. Clinical trials or matched studies comparing TAVI with other treatments for
AS in patients surgically inoperable or operable at a high risk were included.
Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by two reviewers. Data were
pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The main outcomes were all-cause
mortality, efficacy and major complications.
RESULTS: Three good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included.
Patients' mean age ranged from 83-85 years, around half were female and New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV ranged from 83.8% to 94.2%
with frequent comorbidities. In 358 surgically inoperable patients from one RCT, 
TAVI was superior to medical therapy for all-cause mortality at 1 year (hazard
ratio (HR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.92), 2 years (HR 0.50, 95%
CI 0.39-0.65), 3 years (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41to 0.68) and 5 years (HR 0.50, 95% CI
0.39-0.65), and NYHA class III or IV at 2 years (TAVI 16.8% (16/95), medical
therapy 57.5% (23/40), p<0.001), quality of life and re-hospitalisation. TAVI had
higher risks of major bleeding up to 1 year, of stroke up to 3 years (at one year
11.2% versus 5.5%, p = .06; HR at 2 years 2.79, 95% CI 1.25-6.22; HR at 3 years
2.81; 95% CI 1.26-6.26) and of major vascular complication at 3 years (HR 8.27,
95% CI 2.92-23.44). Using the GRADE tool, this evidence was considered to be of
moderate quality. In a meta-analysis including 1,494 high risk surgically
operable patients from two non-inferiority RCTs TAVI showed no significant
differences from SAVR in all-cause mortality at two years (HR 1.03, 95% CI
0.82-1.29) and up to 5 years (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.83-1.12). There were no
statistically significant differences in major vascular complications and
myocardial infarction at any time point, discrepant results for major bleeding on
variable definitions and no differences in stroke rate at any time point. Using
the GRADE tool, this evidence was considered of low quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic aortic stenosis can be lethal without intervention but
surgical resection is contraindicated for some patients and high risk for others.
We found that all-cause mortality up to 5 years of follow-up did not differ
significantly between TAVI and SAVR in patients surgically operable at a high
risk, but favoured TAVI over medical therapy in patients surgically inoperable.
TAVI is a viable life-extending treatment option in these surgical high risk
groups.

Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after
transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for
nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period
are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa …), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or
Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical
antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and
bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation,
pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H.
influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take
advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to 
six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many
years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial
pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of
pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in
diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney
transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with
co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome,
increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common
opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant
recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and 
Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of
immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective
therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy
should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

The number of elderly people has increased considerably over the last decades,
due to a rising life expectancy and ageing populations. As a result, an increased
number of elderly with end-stage-renal-disease are diagnosed, for which the
preferred treatment is renal transplantation. Over the past years the awareness
of the elderly as a specific patient population has grown, which increases the
importance of research in this group. Elderly patients often receive kidneys from
elderly donors while younger donor kidneys are preferentially reserved for
younger recipients. Although the rate of acute rejection after transplantation is
lower in the elderly, these rejections may lead to graft loss more frequently, as
kidneys from elderly donors have marginal reserve capacity. To prevent acute
rejection, immunosuppressive therapy is needed. On the other hand, elderly
patients have a higher risk to die from infectious complications, and thus less
immunosuppression would be preferable. Immunosuppressive treatment in the elderly
is complicated further by changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
with increasing age. Adjustments in standard immunosuppressive regimes are
therefore suggested for this population. An unmet need in transplantation
medicine is a tool to guide a personalized approach to immunosuppression.
Recently several promising biomarkers that identify injury to the graft at an
early stage or predict acute rejection have been identified. Unfortunately, none 
of these biomarkers were tested specifically in the elderly. We believe there is 
an urgent need to perform clinical trials investigating novel immunosuppressive
regimens in conjunction with biomarker studies in this specific population.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an increasingly
common treatment of symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis (AS). Thus, it is
reasonable to carefully investigate the impact of individual clinical factors on 
outcomes after TAVI.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the impact of the previous cerebro-vascular
events (CVEs) on outcomes of patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: A total of 148 consecutive patients scheduled for TAVI were included and
stratified as with and without a history of CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic
attack). Frailty features were also assessed. The primary endpoint was a 12-month
all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Seventeen (11.5%) patients had a history of CVEs (the CVE group). At 30 
days and 12 months, all-cause mortality was higher in the CVE group [30-day: 5
(29.4%) vs. 7 (5.3%); p=0.005; 12-month: 9 (52.9%) vs. 13 (9.9%); p=0.001].
Similarly, at the longest available follow-up, mortality was higher in the CVE
group [10 (58.8%) vs. 23 (17.6%); p=0.001]. Similar rates of other complications 
after TAVI were noted, apart from inhospital acute kidney injury (AKI) grade 3 [3
(17.6%) vs. 5 (3.8%); p=0.049] and blood transfusions [9 (52.9%) vs. 35 (26.7%); 
p=0.026]. Results of 5MWT and Katz index assessment indicated a greater level of 
frailty in the CVE group. There were no differences in subsequent events
including CVEs, bleeding, myocardial infarction, and new-onset of atrial
fibrillation (AF) at 12 months between the groups.
CONCLUSION: We showed that a history of CVEs in patients with severe AS
undergoing TAVI is associated with a higher long-term mortality.

Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of
diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, 
about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years.
Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive
impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly
more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial
disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a
consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a
considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without
any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with
type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into
account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life
expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals
and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically,
overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in
particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used
with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia
are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function
are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

Hypertension is both a health problem and a financial one globally. It affects
nearly 30 % of the general population. Elderly people, aged ≥65 years, are a
special group of hypertensive patients. In this group, the overall prevalence of 
the disease reaches 60 %, rising to 70 % in those aged ≥80 years. In the elderly 
population, isolated systolic hypertension is quite common. High systolic blood
pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, cognitive impairment and
kidney disease. Considering the physiological changes resulting from ageing
alongside multiple comorbidities, treatment of hypertension in elderly patients
poses a significant challenge to treatment teams. Progressive disability with
regard to the activities of daily life, more frequent hospitalisations and low
quality of life are often seen in elderly patients. There is discussion in the
literature regarding frailty syndrome associated with old age. Frailty is
understood to involve decreased resistance to stressors, depleted adaptive and
physiological reserves of a number of organs, endocrine dysregulation and immune 
dysfunction. The primary dilemma concerning frailty is whether it should only be 
defined on the basis of physical factors, or whether psychological and social
factors should also be included. Proper nutrition and motor rehabilitation should
be prioritised in care for frail patients. The risk of orthostatic hypotension is
a significant issue in elderly patients. It results from an autonomic nervous
system dysfunction and involves maladjustment of the cardiovascular system to
sudden changes in the position of the body. Other significant issues in elderly
patients include polypharmacy, increased risk of falls and cognitive impairment. 
Chronic diseases, including hypertension, deteriorate baroreceptor function and
result in irreversible changes in cerebral and coronary circulation. Concurrent
frailty or other components of geriatric syndrome in elderly patients are
associated with a worse perception of health, an increased number of
comorbidities and social isolation of the patient. It may also interfere with
treatment adherence. Identifying causes of non-adherence to pharmaceutical
treatment is a key factor in planning therapeutic interventions aimed at
increasing control, preventing complications, and improving long-term outcomes
and any adverse effects of treatment. Diagnosis of frailty and awareness of the
associated difficulties in adhering to treatment may allow targeting of those
elderly patients who have a poorer prognosis or may be at risk of complications
from untreated or undertreated hypertension, and for the planning of
interventions to improve hypertension control.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcopenia and muscle weakness contribute to fragility and
limit exercise tolerance among patients with CKD. This review focuses on the role
of reduction in mitochondrial mass and function in the myopathy associated with
CKD, causes for these muscle mitochondrial abnormalities, and potential
therapeutic interventions that may improve mitochondrial biogenesis and function 
as well as skeletal muscle function and performance in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial structure, function, and
composition have been shown in both experimental models and patients with CKD. A 
significant reduction in mitochondrial respiratory function and an increase in
mitochondrial complex 1 enzyme activity has been demonstrated in the muscle
tissue of male Sprague-Dawley rats following 5/6 nephrectomy. These changes were 
associated with a substantial reduction in skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass. In
patients with CKD, in-vivo magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy show
significantly elevated resting skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and lower mean 
mitochondrial coupling ratio indicating disrupted muscle mitochondrial metabolism
and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Skeletal muscle biopsies from
patients with advanced CKD show lower mitochondrial volume density and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number than controls.
SUMMARY: Advanced CKD is associated with decreased exercise capacity, skeletal
muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. Impaired mitochondrial respiratory function,
reduced muscle mitochondrial mass, and decreased energy production in skeletal
muscle play a critical role in this 'acquired mitochondrial myopathy' of CKD. It 
is reasonable, therefore, to develop therapeutic interventions that enhance
mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as skeletal muscle function and
performance in patients with CKD.

As the cirrhosis progresses, development of complication like ascites, hepatic
encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, kidney dysfunction, and hepatocellular
carcinoma signify increasing risk of short term mortality. Malnutrition and
muscle wasting (sarcopenia) is yet other complications that negatively impact
survival, quality of life, and response to stressors, such as infection and
surgery in patients with cirrhosis. Conventionally, these are not routinely
looked for, because nutritional assessment can be a difficult especially if there
is associated fluid retention and/or obesity. Patients with cirrhosis may have a 
combination of loss of skeletal muscle and gain of adipose tissue, culminating in
the condition of "sarcopenic obesity." Sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients has been 
associated with increased mortality, sepsis complications, hyperammonemia, overt 
hepatic encephalopathy, and increased length of stay after liver transplantation.
Assessment of muscles with cross-sectional imaging studies has become an
attractive index of nutritional status evaluation in cirrhosis, as sarcopenia,
the major component of malnutrition, is primarily responsible for the adverse
clinical consequences seen in patients with liver disease. Cirrhosis is a state
of accelerated starvation, with increased gluconeogenesis that requires amino
acid diversion from other metabolic functions. Protein homeostasis is disturbed
in cirrhosis due to several factors such as hyperammonemia, hormonal, and
cytokine abnormalities, physical inactivity and direct effects of ethanol and its
metabolites. New approaches to manage sarcopenia are being evolved. Branched
chain amino acid supplementation, Myostatin inhibitors, and mitochondrial
protective agents are currently in various stages of evaluation in preclinical
studies to prevent and reverse sarcopenia, in cirrhosis.

Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with higher mortality.
We aimed to identify the baseline predictors of in-hospital mortality among
elderly patients with non-valvular AF (NVAF) hospitalised for any reason.
METHODS: Observational, prospective and multicentre study was carried out on
patients with NVAF over the age of 75, who had been admitted for any acute
medical condition to Internal Medicine departments in Spain.
RESULTS: We evaluated 804 patients with a mean age of 85±5.1years, of which 53.9%
were females. During the hospitalization 10.1% (n=81) of the patients died. The
patients who died were older, had a greater percentage of institutionalization,
worse previous basic functional status (Barthel Index), worse cognitive
performance at admission and greater proportion of frailty and sarcopenia.
Logistic regression multivariate analysis identified that the strongest
determinants of in-hospital mortality were the baseline functional status
(Barthel Index) (OR for total dependency 4.73, 95% CI 2.32-9.63), and admissions 
for stroke (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.41-8.90) and acute renal failure (OR 1.93, 95% CI
1.12-3.32).
CONCLUSION: The overall in-hospital mortality of elderly patients with NVFA is
high. Among all factors evaluated in the global geriatric assessment the baseline
functional status was the strongest predictor for in-hospital mortality on this
population.

Persons living with HIV (PLWH) have accentuated risks for age-associated
comorbidities. Compared to the general population, PLWH have a 2-fold higher risk
of cardiovascular disease, a 3-fold increased risk of fracture, and a risk of
kidney disease that is comparable to that in diabetes. Some comorbidities may
present at younger ages than among the general population, suggesting the
possibility of accelerated aging with HIV infection.

OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia measured by decreased psoas muscle size has been used as a 
surrogate for frailty and correlates with adverse outcomes in both the short and 
long term after many major operations. Our aim was to evaluate this measure as a 
predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair 
(EVAR).
METHODS: Once Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, all patients who 
underwent EVAR from December 2010 to March 2016 at a Veterans Affairs hospital
were assessed for sarcopenia by total psoas muscle area (TPA) measured on axial
computed tomography scan immediately inferior to the fourth lumbar (L4) superior 
end plate. Outcomes including length of stay and mortality were collected from
the medical record.
RESULTS: There were 135 patients who underwent EVAR at a median age of 70 years. 
Median aneurysm size was 5.5 cm. Length of stay was >2 days in 25% of patients
(n = 33), with the most common reasons for delayed discharge including
respiratory complications (8.9% [n = 12]) and urinary retention (4.0% [n = 9]).
Low TPA was not associated with extended length of stay (P = .40). Patients with 
lowest tertile TPA had 42% 5-year survival compared with 93% survival observed
for the remaining two-thirds of patients (P = .01). Multivariate analysis
revealed increased likelihood of mortality at 5 years for patients in the lowest 
tertile for TPA (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.9) as well as
for patients with chronic kidney disease (odds ratio, 5.2; 95% confidence
interval, 1.5-18.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative sarcopenia does not appear to affect length of stay but
does portend worse long-term survival. This simple preoperative measurement may
help vascular surgeons tailor repair thresholds and avoid nonbeneficial
procedures.

To assess whether biopsy-guided selection of kidneys from very old brain-dead
donors enables more successful transplantations, the authors of this multicenter,
observational study compared graft survival between 37 recipients of 1 or 2
histologically evaluated kidneys from donors older than 80 years and 198
reference-recipients of non-histologically evaluated single grafts from donors
aged 60 years and younger (transplantation period: 2006-2013 at 3 Italian
centers). During a median (interquartile range) of 25 (13-42) months, 2
recipients (5.4%) and 10 reference-recipients (5.1%) required dialysis (crude and
donor age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.55
[0.34-7.12], P = .576 and 1.41 [0.10-19.54], P = .798, respectively). Shared
frailty analyses confirmed similar outcomes in a 1:2 propensity score study
comparing recipients with 74 reference-recipients matched by center, year, donor,
and recipient sex and age. Serum creatinine was similar across groups during
84-month follow-up. Recipients had remarkably shorter waiting times than did
reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (7.5 [4.0-19.5] vs 36
[19-56] and 40 [24-56] months, respectively, P < .0001 for both comparisons).
Mean (± SD) kidney donor risk index was 2.57 ± 0.32 in recipients vs 1.09 ± 0.24 
and 1.14 ± 0.24 in reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients
(P < .0001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were similar across groups.
Biopsy-guided allocation of kidneys from octogenarian donors permits further
expansion of the donor organ pool and faster access to a kidney transplant,
without increasing the risk of premature graft failure.

AIM: to assess the prevalence of some geriatric syndromes and their association
with high risk of cardiovascular complications (RCVC) among elderly women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 72 women aged 69-77 years with cardiovascular
diseases. Examination included laboratory and echocardiography assessment,
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, 6-min walk test, assessment of psycho-emotional
status using Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire. Frailty was
defined as three or more of the following: weight loss, low physical activity
levels, MMSE less or equal 23 points, weakness (chair stand test>10 sec), history
of multiple falls. Follow up was 7.3 (5.5-7.8) months.
RESULTS: High CVR was found in 70.8% women: in 59.1% women aged 65-74 years and
in 89.3% - aged more or equal 75 years, =0.006. Osteoporosis (OP) was found in
51.3% women aged 65-74 and in 90.5% - aged more or equal 75 years, =0.024; MMSE
was 27 (24-28) vs 24 (20-26) points, respectively, =0.008. The geriatric syndrome
of frailty was found in 13.6% women aged 65-74 and in 64.3% - aged more or equal 
75 years. Frailty was associated with high CVR (odds ratio [R] 7.2, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.5-34.2, =0.013), chronic kidney disease (CKD, R 18.9, 
95%CI 5.2-20.2, <0.001), P (R 4.5, 95%CI 1.3-15.8, =0.019), history of myocardial
infarction (MI, R 6.8, 95%CI 2.2-20.8, =0.001), greater age (R 6.0, 95%CI
2.1-17.5, =0.001).
CONCLUSION: High CVR was prevalent among greater age women what could be
explained by prevalence of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, CKD.
Prevalence of frailty was 13.6 and 64.3% among women aged 65-74 and more or equal
75years, respectively. It was significantly associated with high CVR, OP, PMI,
CKD.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: This article ponders upon wearable medical measurement devices in
relation to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its' associated comorbidities - and 
whether these might benefit CKD-patients. We aimed to map the intersection(s) of 
nephrology and wearable sensor technology to help technologists understand
medical aspects, and clinicians to understand technological possibilities that
are available (or soon will become so). Areas covered: A structured literature
search on main comorbidities and complications CKD patients suffer from, was used
to steer mini-reviews on wearable sensor technologies clustered around 3 themes
being: Cardiovascular-related, diabetes-related and physical fitness/frailty.
This review excludes wearable dialysis - although also strongly enabled by
miniaturization - because that highly important theme deserves separate in-depth 
reviewing. Expert commentary: Continuous progress in integrated electronics
miniaturization enormously lowered price, size, weight and energy consumption of 
electronic sensors, processing power, memory and wireless connectivity. These
combined factors boost opportunities for wearable medical sensors. Such devices
can be regarded as enablers for: Remote monitoring, influencing human behaviour
(exercise, dietary), enhanced home care, remote consults, patient education and
peer networks. However, to make wearable medical devices succeed, the challenge
to fit them into health care structures will be dominant over the challenge to
realize the bare technologies themselves.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered a model of accelerated aging. More
specifically, CKD leads to reduced physical functioning and increased frailty,
increased vascular dysfunction, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness,
high levels of systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased 
cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence suggests that the cognitive impairment 
associated with CKD may be related to cerebral small vessel disease and overall
impairment in white matter integrity. The triad of poor physical function,
vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment places patients living with CKD at
an increased risk for loss of independence, poor health-related quality of life, 
morbidity, and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the available 
evidence of cerebrovascular-renal axis and its interconnection with early and
accelerated cognitive impairment in patients with CKD and the plausible role of
exercise as a therapeutic modality. Understanding the cerebrovascular-renal axis 
pathophysiological link and its interconnection with physical function is
important for clinicians in order to minimize the risk of loss of independence
and improve quality of life in patients with CKD.

Patients with chronic kidney disease experience substantial loss of muscle mass, 
weakness, and poor physical performance. As kidney disease progresses, skeletal
muscle dysfunction forms a common pathway for mobility limitation, loss of
functional independence, and vulnerability to disease complications. Screening
for those at high risk for mobility disability by self-reported and objective
measures of function is an essential first step in developing an
interdisciplinary approach to treatment that includes rehabilitative therapies
and counseling on physical activity. Exercise has beneficial effects on systemic 
inflammation, muscle, and physical performance in chronic kidney disease. Kidney 
health providers need to identify patient and care delivery barriers to exercise 
in order to effectively counsel patients on physical activity. A thorough medical
evaluation and assessment of baseline function using self-reported and objective 
function assessment is essential to guide an effective individualized exercise
prescription to prevent function decline in persons with kidney disease. This
review focuses on the impact of kidney disease on skeletal muscle dysfunction in 
the context of the disablement process and reviews screening and treatment
strategies that kidney health professionals can use in clinical practice to
prevent functional decline and disability.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review sarcopenia in chronic kidney
disease (CKD). We aim to present how definitions of sarcopenia from the general
population may pertain to those with CKD, its assessment by clinicians and
emerging therapies for sarcopenia in CKD. For this review, we limit our
description and recommendations to patients with CKD who are not on dialysis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Poorer parameters of lean mass, strength and physical function
are associated with worsening patient-centered outcomes such as limiting
mobility, falls and mortality in CKD; however, the magnitude of these
associations are different in those with and without CKD. Sarcopenia in CKD is a 
balance between skeletal muscle regeneration and catabolism, which are both
altered in the uremic environment. Multiple pathways are involved in these
derangements, which are briefly reviewed. Differences between commonly used terms
cachexia, frailty, protein-energy wasting, dynapenia and sarcopenia are
described. Therapeutic options in predialysis CKD are not well studied;
therefore, we review exercise options and emerging pharmacological therapies.
SUMMARY: Sarcopenia, now with its own International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision (ICD-10) code, is of importance clinically and should be accounted 
for in research studies in patients with CKD. Multiple therapies for sarcopenia
are in development and will hopefully be available for our patients in the
future.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older kidney transplant recipients are susceptible to 
cognitive impairment, frailty, comorbidities, immunosuppression-related
complications, and chronic graft failure, however, there has been limited focus
on their concerns and expectations related to transplantation. This study aims to
describe the perspectives of older kidney transplant recipients about their
experience of kidney transplantation, self-management, and treatment goals to
inform strategies and interventions that address their specific needs.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Face-to-face semistructured
interviews were conducted with 30 kidney transplant recipients aged 65-80 years
from five renal units in Australia. Transcripts were analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: Six themes were identified: restoring vitality of youth (with subthemes 
of revived mindset for resilience, embracing enjoyment in life, drive for
self-actualization); persisting through prolonged recovery (yielding to aging,
accepting functional limitations, pushing the limit, enduring treatment
responsibilities); imposing sicknesses (combatting devastating comorbidities,
painful restrictions, emerging disillusionment, anxieties about accumulating side
effects, consuming treatment burden); prioritizing graft survival (privileged
with a miracle, negotiating risks for longevity, enacting a moral duty,
preserving the last opportunity); confronting health deterioration (vulnerability
and helplessness, narrowing focus to immediate concerns, uncertainty of
survival); and value of existence (purpose through autonomy, refusing the burden 
of futile treatment, staying alive by all means).
CONCLUSIONS: Older kidney transplant recipients felt able to enjoy life and
strived to live at their newly re-established potential and capability, which
motivated them to protect their graft. However, some felt constrained by slow
recuperation and overwhelmed by unexpected comorbidities, medication-related side
effects, and health decline. Our findings suggest the need to prepare and support
older recipients for self-management responsibilities, clarify their expectations
of post-transplant risks and outcomes, and provide assistance through prolonged
recovery after kidney transplantation.

It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased
postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease 
who underwent lower extremity surgical revascularization; however, outcomes after
peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) are less well established. This study
sought to determine the impact of CKD on adverse outcomes in patients with
peripheral artery disease who underwent PVI. Using data from the Veteran Affairs 
Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System Program, we identified a
cohort of 755 patients who underwent lower extremity PVI from June 2005 to August
2010 at 33 sites. The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to
dialysis, myocardial infarction, limb amputation, and stroke. Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard frailty models assessed the
association between CKD and adverse outcomes. Of the patients who underwent lower
extremity PVI, 201 patients (27%) had CKD. The presence of CKD was associated
with decreased survival (5-year survival probability of CKD compared with
non-CKD: 49.9% [41.6% to 59.9%] vs 80.1% [76.2% to 84.1]), which persisted after 
risk adjustment (HR 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.19). In addition,
there was a significant association between CKD and progression to dialysis (HR
6.62; 95% confidence interval 2.25 to 19.43). In contrast, there was no
association between CKD and re-hospitalization for myocardial infarction, limb
amputation, or stroke. In conclusion, CKD is present in 1 of 4 patients who
underwent PVI and is associated with increased risk of mortality and progression 
to dialysis.

Hypoalbuminemia, a frailty criterion, belongs to a group of co-morbidities not
captured as a traditional risk factor. We assessed its prognostic value in
patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The study 
included 1,215 consecutive patients from the Optimized Catheter Valvular
Intervention -TAVI Japanese multicenter registry. Hypoalbuminemia was defined as 
serum albumin level <3.5 g/dl. Baseline characteristics, procedural outcomes, and
all-cause, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality rates after TAVI were
compared between patients with albumin level <3.5 g/dl (hypo[h]-ALB group, n =
284) and those with albumin level >3.5 g/dl (nonhypo[nh]-ALB group, n = 931).
Several baseline characteristics differed significantly between both groups,
including age (85.1 ± 5.1 vs 84.2 ± 4.9 years, p = 0.012), ejection fraction
(58.5 ± 14.3% vs 62.9 ± 12.4%, p <0.001), baseline kidney function, or liver
disease. The 30-day mortality rate in all patients showed significant differences
between the 2 groups (3.9% vs 1.3%, p = 0.005). During a mean follow-up of
330 days, cumulative all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality
rates were significantly higher in the hALB group than in the nhALB group
(log-rank test, p <0.001, p = 0.0021, and p <0.001, respectively). The groups
were also analyzed using a propensity matching model for adjusting the baseline
differences. The analysis revealed that the poorer prognosis of the hALB group in
terms of cumulative all-cause and noncardiovascular mortality was retained (p =
0.038, and p = 0.0068, respectively); however, differences in cardiovascular
mortality rates in the 2 groups were attenuated (p = 0.93). In conclusion,
hypoalbuminemia was associated with poor prognosis, highlighted by the increase
in noncardiovascular mortality. Baseline albumin level could be a useful marker
for risk stratification before TAVI.

PURPOSE: Frailty and functional status have emerged as significant predictors of 
morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing cancer surgery. To articulate the
impact on value (ie quality per cost), we compared perioperative outcomes and
expenditures according to patient function for older adults undergoing kidney
cancer surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using linked SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
Results)-Medicare data, we identified 19,129 elderly patients with kidney cancer 
treated with nonablative surgery from 2000 to 2009. We quantified patient
function using function related indicators (claims indicative of dysfunction and 
disability) and measured 30-day morbidity, mortality, resource use and cost.
Using multivariable, mixed effects models to adjust for patient and hospital
characteristics, we estimated the relationship of patient functionality with both
treatment outcomes and expenditures.
RESULTS: Of 19,129 patients we identified 5,509 (28.8%) and 3,127 (16.4%) with a 
function related indicator count of 1 and 2 or greater, respectively. While
surgical complications did not vary (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86-1.05), patients with 2 
or more indicators more often experienced a medical event (OR 1.22, 95% CI
1.10-1.36) or a geriatric event (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.33-1.81), or died within 30
days of surgery (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.10-1.86) compared with patients with no
baseline dysfunction. These patients utilized significantly more medical
resources and amassed higher acute care expenditures (p <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: During kidney cancer surgery, patients in poor functional health can
face a more eventful medical recovery at elevated cost, indicating lower value
care. Greater consideration of frailty and functional status during treatment
planning and transitions may represent areas for value enhancement in kidney
cancer and urology care.

BACKGROUND: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including 
adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key
consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures
of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with
complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013).
PREDICTORS: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated
using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine
albumin-creatinine ratio.
OUTCOME: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty
characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical
activity).
RESULTS: 341 (7%) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30%) had
eGFRcr<60mL/min/1.73m2, 2,480 (50%) had eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2, and 1,006 (20%) 
had albuminuria with albumin excretion ≥ 30mg/g. Among frail participants,
prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2 were 45% and 77%, respectively.
Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a 
strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals
with eGFRcr of 60 to <75mL/min/1.73m2 were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR 
categories using eGFRcys (49% to 45-<60, 32% to 30-<45, and 3%
to <30mL/min/1.73m2). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking ≥10 classes of medications) was
more common in frail individuals (54% vs 38% of nonfrail), including classes
requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent
complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants).
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, 
with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys
versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic
kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative
biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this
vulnerable population.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older
adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive
impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of
life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in
increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in
hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients 
with pre-dialysis CKD.
METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385
patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated 
tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive
frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial.
Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of ≤24. We determined the
prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages 
G4-G5, not on dialysis.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5
had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control
group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most
pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function 
(p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of
stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment
in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects
of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of
cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes
deserves further study.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney
function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in
community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level,
and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0
(normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Frailty status
was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle
weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of
having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were more frail
(odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition,
individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or
hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of
frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. 
Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty

Dysregulation of skeletal remodeling is a component of renal osteodystrophy.
Previously, we showed that activin receptor signaling is differentially affected 
in various tissues in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether a ligand
trap for the activin receptor type 2A (RAP-011) is an effective treatment of the 
osteodystrophy of the CKD-mineral bone disorder. With a 70% reduction in the
glomerular filtration rate, CKD was induced at 14 weeks of age in the ldlr-/-
high fat-fed mouse model of atherosclerotic vascular calcification and diabetes. 
Twenty mice with CKD, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated
activin A were treated with RAP-011, wherease 19 mice were given vehicle twice
weekly from week 22 until the mice were killed at 28 weeks of age. The animals
were then evaluated by skeletal histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography,
mechanical strength testing, and ex vivo bone cell culture. Results in the CKD
groups were compared with those of the 16 sham-operated ldlr-/- high fat-fed
mice. Sham-operated mice had low-turnover osteodystrophy and skeletal frailty.
CKD stimulated bone remodeling with significant increases in osteoclast and
osteoblast numbers and bone resorption. Compared with mice with CKD
and sham-operated mice, RAP-011 treatment eliminated the CKD-induced increase in 
these histomorphometric parameters and increased trabecular bone fraction.
RAP-011 significantly increased cortical bone area and thickness. Activin
A-enhanced osteoclastogenesis was mediated through p-Smad2 association with c-fos
and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Thus, an
ActRIIA ligand trap reversed CKD-stimulated bone remodeling, likely through
inhibition of activin-A induced osteoclastogenesis.

Frailty is a major health burden in an aging society. It constitutes a clinical
state of reduced physiological reserves that is associated with a diminished
ability to withstand internal and external stressors. Frail patients have an
increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes, such as mortality, readmission to
hospital, institutionalization and falls. Of further clinical interest, frailty
might be at least in part reversible in some patients and subject to preventive
strategies. In daily clinical practice older patients with a complex health
status, who are mostly frail or at least at risk of developing frailty, are
frequently cared for by geriatricians. Recently, clinicians and scientists from
other medical disciplines, such as cardiology, pulmonology, gastroenterology,
nephrology, endocrinology, rheumatology, surgery and critical care medicine also 
discovered frailty to be an interesting instrument for risk stratification of
patients, including younger patients. In this review we highlight the results of 
recent studies that demonstrated the significance of frailty to predict adverse
clinical outcomes in patients with specific medical conditions, such as cardiac, 
lung, liver and kidney diseases as well as diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis,
trauma patients, patients undergoing surgery and critically ill patients.
Multiple studies in patients with the aforementioned specific medical conditions 
could be identified demonstrating a predictive role of frailty for several
adverse clinical outcomes. The association between frailty and adverse clinical
outcomes reported in these studies was in part independent of several major
potential confounder factors, such as age, sex, race, comorbidities and
disabilities and were also detected in younger patients.

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its
impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
is less defined.
METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 
trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three
groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR
≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were
analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors
of 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the
PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767
(30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 
(12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted
Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with
severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher
prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of
death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate
and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% 
in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild
RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus
none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other
significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass
index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction,
oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male
sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year
mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is
required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a perioperative metastatic spinal
tumor frailty index (MSTFI) that could predict morbidity, mortality, and length
of stay.
METHODS: A large inpatient hospitalization database was searched from 2002 to
2011 to identify 4583 patients with spinal metastasis from breast (21.1%), lung
(34.1%), thyroid (3.8%), renal (19.9%), and prostate (21.1%) cancer who underwent
surgery. A multiple logistic regression model identified 9 independent parameters
that were used to construct the MSTFI: anemia, chronic lung disease,
coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary circulation disorders, renal
failure, malnutrition, emergent/urgent admission, and anterior/combined surgical 
approach. Patients with 0 points were categorized as "not frail," 1 as "mildly
frail," 2 as "moderately frail," and ≥3 as "severely frail."
RESULTS: The overall perioperative complication rate was 19.3% and in-patient
mortality was 3.0%. Compared with patients with no frailty, patients with
moderate frailty (odds ratio [OR] 5.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]
2.44-10.86), and severe frailty (OR 5.74; 95% CI 2.69-12.24) had significantly
increased odds of inpatient mortality (all P < 0.001). Similarly, patients with
mild frailty (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.33-2.66), moderate frailty (OR 3.83; 95% CI
2.71-5.41), and severe frailty (OR 6.97; 95% CI 4.98-9.74) had significantly
increased odds of developing a major in-hospital complication (all P < 0.001).
Length of stay also increased significantly by MSTFI (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In surgically treated patients with spinal metastasis, certain
perioperative parameters may significantly predict the risk of major in-hospital 
complications and mortality.

Dialysis care is often associated with poor outcomes including low quality of
life (QOL). To improve patient-reported outcomes, incorporation of the patient's 
needs and perspective into the medical care they receive is essential. This
article provides a framework to help clinicians integrate symptom assessment and 
other measures such as QOL and frailty scores into a clinical approach to the
contemporary supportive care of patients with advanced CKD. This approach
involves (1) defining our understanding of kidney supportive care,
patient-centered dialysis, and palliative dialysis; (2) understanding and
recognizing common symptoms associated with advanced CKD; (3) discussing the
concepts of physical function, frailty, and QOL and their role in CKD; and (4)
identifying the structural and process barriers that may arise when
patient-centered dialysis is being introduced into clinical practice.

OBJECTIVES: Screening tools to determine which outpatients with cirrhosis are at 
highest risk for unplanned hospitalization are lacking. Frailty is a novel
prognostic factor but conventional screening for frailty is time consuming. We
evaluated the ability of a 1 min bedside screen (Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)) to
predict unplanned hospitalization or death in outpatients with cirrhosis and
compared the CFS with two conventional frailty measures (Fried Frailty Criteria
(FFC) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)).
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive outpatients from three tertiary
care liver clinics. Frailty was defined by CFS >4. The primary outcome was the
composite of unplanned hospitalization or death within 6 months of study entry.
RESULTS: A total of 300 outpatients were enrolled (mean age 57 years, 35% female,
81% white, 66% hepatitis C or alcohol-related liver disease, mean Model for
End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score 12, 28% with ascites). Overall, 54 (18%)
outpatients were frail and 91 (30%) patients had an unplanned hospitalization or 
death within 6 months. CFS >4 was independently associated with increased rates
of unplanned hospitalization or death (57% frail vs. 24% not frail, adjusted odds
ratio 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-7.5; P=0.0008) and there was a dose 
response (adjusted odds ratio 1.9 per 1-unit increase in CFS, 95% CI: 1.4-2.6;
P<0.0001). Models including MELD, ascites, and CFS >4 had a greater
discrimination (c-statistic=0.84) than models using FFC or SPPB.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is strongly and independently associated with an increased
risk of unplanned hospitalization or death in outpatients with cirrhosis. The CFS
is a rapid screen that could be easily adopted in liver clinics to identify those
at highest risk of adverse events.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation offers improved survival and quality of life
to an increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease.
However, elderly kidney transplant recipients may face unique challenges due to a
higher burden of comorbidity, greater cumulative risk of
immunosuppression-related complications and increasing frailty. We aimed to
describe the perspectives of elderly kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to April 2015. Qualitative studies
were eligible if they reported views from elderly kidney transplant recipients
(≥60 years). Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the findings.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving >116 recipients were included. We
identified seven themes. 'Regaining strength and vitality' meant valuing the
physical and psychosocial improvements in daily functioning and life
participation. 'Extending life' was the willingness to accept any organ,
including extended criteria kidneys, to prolong survival. 'Debt of gratitude'
entailed conscious appreciation toward their donor while knowing they were unable
to repay their sacrifice. 'Moral responsibility to maintain health' motivated
adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations out of an ethical duty to
protect their gift for graft survival. 'Unabating and worsening forgetfulness'
hindered self-management. 'Disillusionment with side effects and complications'
reflected disappointment and exasperation with the unintended consequences of
medications. 'Finality of treatment option' was an acute awareness that the
current transplant may be their last.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation was perceived to slow and even reverse the
experience of aging among elderly recipients, especially compared with dialysis. 
However, some were frustrated over persistent limitations after transplant,
struggled with the burden of medication side effects and worried about a possible
return to dialysis if the transplant failed. Clarifying patient expectations of
transplantation, providing support to alleviate the debilitating impacts of
immunosuppression and addressing fears about deteriorating health and graft
failure may improve satisfaction and outcomes in elderly kidney transplant
recipients.

Antihypertensive treatment is aimed at reducing as much as possible health
outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. The main international guidelines
and clinical trials showed different positions about blood pressure targets. At
present, there is no common opinion about the benefits of an aggressive drug
treatment; moreover it is not clear whether lower blood pressure values are
related to increased morbidity and mortality. The recent randomized SPRINT trial 
has compared intensive vs standard drug therapy in a non-diabetic hypertensive
population. The trial has shown benefits of intensive treatment in reducing
important health outcomes, though results were not confirmed in several patient
subsets. We examined the studies on hypertensive patients with comorbidities
(i.e., chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) to identify blood pressure
targets recommended in these populations, but no strong evidence was found about 
the benefits of intensive treatment. In geriatric patients the "lower is better" 
paradigm cannot be entirely applied because of comorbidity, polypharmacy and
frailty.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

Skeletal muscle mass and muscle function are negatively affected by a variety of 
conditions inherent to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to dialysis treatment.
Skeletal muscle mass and function serve as indicators of the nutritional and
clinical state of CKD patients, and low values or derangements over time are
strong predictors of poor patient outcomes. However, muscle size and function can
be affected by different factors, may decline at different rates, and may have
different patient implications. Therefore, operational definitions of frailty and
sarcopenia have emerged to encompass these 2 dimensions of muscle health, i.e.,
size and functionality. The aim of this review is to appraise available methods
for assessment of muscle mass and functionality, with an emphasis on their
accuracy in the setting of CKD patients. We then discuss the selection of
reference cutoffs for defining conditions of muscle wasting and dysfunction.
Finally, we review definitions applied in studies addressing sarcopenia and
frailty in CKD patients and discuss their applicability for diagnosis and
monitoring.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with
postoperative delirium in patients undergoing urological surgery.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated pre- and postoperative risk factors for
postoperative delirium in consecutive 215 patients who received urological
surgery between August 2013 and November 2014. Preoperative factors included
patient demographics, comorbidities, and frailty assessment. Frailty was measured
by handgrip strength, fatigue scale of depression, fall risk assessment, and gait
speed (the timed Get-up and Go test). Postoperative factors included types of
anesthesia, surgical procedure, renal function and serum albumin decline, blood
loss, surgery time, highest body temperature, and complications. Uni- and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess pre- and
postoperative predictors for the development of postoperative delirium.
RESULTS: Median age of this cohort was 67 years. Ten patients (4.7%) experienced 
postoperative delirium. These patients were significantly older, had weak
handgrip strength, a higher fall risk assessment score, slow gait speed, and
greater renal function decline compared with patients without delirium.
Multivariate analysis revealed slow gait speed (>13.0 s) and rapid renal function
decline (>30%) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow gait speed and rapid renal function decline after urological
surgery are significant factors for postoperative delirium. These data will be
helpful for perioperative patient management. This study was registered as a
clinical trial: UMIN: R000018809.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With aging of the general population, patients who
enter dialysis therapy will more frequently have geriatric impairments and a
considerable comorbidity burden. The most vulnerable among these patients might
benefit from conservative therapy. Whether assessment of geriatric impairments
would contribute to the decision-making process of dialysis initiation is
unknown.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A systematic Medline and Embase
search was performed on December 1, 2015 to identify studies assessing the
association between risk of mortality or hospitalization and one or more
geriatric impairments at the start of dialysis therapy, including impairment of
cognitive function, mood, performance status or (instrumental) activities of
daily living, mobility (including falls), social environment, or nutritional
status.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were identified that assessed one or more geriatric
impairments with respect to prognosis. The quality of most studies was moderate. 
Only seven studies carried out an analysis of elderly patients (≥70 years old).
Malnutrition and frailty were systematically assessed, and their relation with
mortality was clear. In addition, cognitive impairment and functional outcomes at
the initiation of dialysis were related to an increased mortality in most
studies. However, not all studies applied systematic assessment tools, thereby
potentially missing relevant impairment. None of the studies applied a geriatric 
assessment across multiple domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric impairment across multiple domains at dialysis initiation 
is related to poor outcome. However, information in the elderly is sparse, and a 
systematic approach of multiple domains with respect to poor outcome has not been
performed. Because a geriatric assessment has proved useful in predicting outcome
in other medical fields, its potential role in the ESRD population should be the 
subject of future research.

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with
destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial
cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However,
surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis
rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on
hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal
kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree
decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior
instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to
adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical 
motion.

The aim of this study was to analyze procedural and postprocedural outcomes of
patients aged ≥80 years treated by transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) as enrolled in the OBservational
Study of Effectiveness of SAVR-TAVR procedures for severe Aortic steNosis
Treatment (OBSERVANT) Study. TAVI is offered to patients with aortic stenosis
judged inoperable or at high surgical risk. Nevertheless, it is common clinical
practice to treat elderly (≥80 years) patients by TAVI regardless of surgical
risk for traditional SAVR. OBSERVANT is a multicenter, observational, prospective
cohort study that enrolled patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who
underwent SAVR or TAVI from December 2010 to June 2012 in 93 Italian
participating hospitals. Information on demographic characteristics, health
status before intervention, therapeutic approach, and intraprocedural and 30-day 
outcomes was collected. An administrative follow-up was set up to collect data on
midterm to long-term outcomes. We reviewed baseline and procedural data of
patients aged ≥80 years, looking for different early and late outcome after TAVI 
or SAVR. Patients treated by TAVI were sicker than SAVR because of higher rate of
co-morbidities, advanced illness, frailty, and Logistic EuroSCORE. After
propensity matching, early and midterm mortality were comparable between the 2
groups. However, patients treated by TAVI had higher rate of vascular
complications (6.0% vs 0.5%; p <0.0001), permanent pacemaker implantation (13.4% 
vs 3.7%; p <0.0001), and paravalvular leak (8.9% vs 2.4%; p <0.0001). Patients
who underwent SAVR had more frequent bleedings needing transfusion (63.2% vs
34.5%; p <0.0001) and acute kidney injury (9.6% vs 3.9%; p = 0.0010). In
conclusion, patients aged ≥80 years treated by TAVI or SAVR had similar early and
midterm mortality.

BACKGROUND: Surgical risk scores do not include frailty assessments (eg, gait
speed), which are of particular importance for patients with severe aortic
stenosis considering transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the association of 5-m gait speed with outcomes 
in a cohort of 8039 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement
(November 2011-June 2014) and were included in the Society of Thoracic
Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry. We 
evaluated the association between continuous and categorical gait speed and
30-day all-cause mortality before and after adjustment for Society of Thoracic
Surgeons-predicted risk of mortality score and key variables. Secondary outcomes 
included in-hospital mortality, bleeding, acute kidney injury, and stroke. The
overall median gait speed was 0.63 m/s (25th-75th percentile, 0.47-0.79 m/s),
with the slowest walkers (<0.5 m/s) constituting 28%, slow walkers (0.5-0.83 m/s)
making up 48%, and normal walkers (>0.83 m/s) constituting 24% of the population.
Thirty-day all-cause mortality rates were 8.4%, 6.6%, and 5.4% for the slowest,
slow, and normal walkers, respectively (P<0.001). Each 0.2-m/s decrease in gait
speed corresponded to an 11% increase in 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio,
1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.22). The slowest walkers had 35% higher
30-day mortality than normal walkers (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence
interval, 1.01-1.80), significantly longer hospital stays, and a lower
probability of being discharged to home.
CONCLUSIONS: Gait speed is independently associated with 30-day mortality after
transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Identification of frail patients with the
slowest gait speeds facilitates preprocedural evaluation and anticipation of a
higher level of postprocedural care.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

Prehabilitation in our most frail surgical patients: are wearable fitness devices
the next frontier?

Alto, California, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is the concept of accumulating physiologic declines
that make people less able to deal with stressors, including surgery.
Prehabilitation is intervention to enhance functional capacity before surgery.
Frailty and prehabilitation among transplant populations and the role of wearable
fitness tracking devices (WFTs) in delivering fitness-based interventions will be
discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty is associated with increased complications, longer
length of hospital stay and increased mortality after surgery. Frail kidney
transplant patients have increased delayed graft function, mortality and early
hospital readmission. Frail lung or liver transplant patients are more likely to 
delist or die on the waitlist. Prehabilitation can mitigate frailty and has
resulted in decreased length of hospital stay and fewer postsurgical
complications among a variety of surgical populations. Increasingly, WFTs are
used to monitor patient activity and improve patient health. Interventions using 
WFTs have resulted in improved activity, weight loss and blood pressure.
SUMMARY: Frailty is a measurable parameter that identifies patients at risk for
worse health outcomes and can be mitigated through intervention. Prehabilitation 
to reduce frailty has been shown to improve postsurgical outcomes in a variety of
populations. WFTs are being integrated in healthcare delivery for monitoring and 
changing health behavior with promising results.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure (HBP) are commonly
associated conditions in the elderly population. An effect of treatments,
biologic and anthropometric variables on long-term mortality is unknown in this
population.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of HBP control in a sample of elderly
patients with type 2 diabetes with office blood pressure (BP) readings and
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and evaluate the influence of BP,
anthropometric and laboratory variables on long term mortality.
METHODS: Cohort study in patients living at home in the area of Sherbrooke, ≥65
years old, receiving reimbursement for antidiabetic medication. The study
included medical history, 2 sets of BP measurements, 2 24-hour urinary
collections for microalbuminuria, 1 24-hour ABPM, blood level of creatinine and
glycosylated hemoglobin. Charts were reanalyzed 8 years later for analysis of
cardiovascular and total mortality cases.
RESULTS: 198 patients were initially recruited. By history, 83% of the subjects
had diagnoses and treatments for high blood pressure. In multivariate analysis,
factors associated with an 8-year increased risk for cardiovascular mortality
were creatinine ≥84 µmol/L, office seated systolic blood pressure ≤130 and
diastolic BP ≤67.6 over 24 hours. Factors associated with total mortality were
lower waist circumference, serum creatinine ≥84 and diastolic BP ≤67.6 over 24
hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower systolic and diastolic BP (office and ABPM), lower waist
circumference and higher creatinine values are associated with an increased
mortality risk. This suggests that a lower BP, declining kidney function and
frailty are factors associated with this observation.

BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been reported regarding impact of body mass 
index (BMI) on outcome of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients.
This study evaluates the impact of BMI on 1 year mortality in patients undergoing
TAVR via the transfemoral (TF) access.
METHODS: Aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing TAVR via a TF access between
May 2007 and December 2014 were categorized to 4 groups by BMI: low (<20), normal
(20-24.9), overweight (25-30), and obese (>30). Baseline parameters were
compared, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were
generated to assess outcome differences.
RESULTS: Among 491 severe AS TAVR patients, 43 had low BMI, 148 had normal BMI,
162 were overweight, and 138 were obese. Obese patients were younger with lower
Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores and higher rates of preserved ejection
fraction and diabetes. There was a higher rate of women in the BMI extremes.
Aortic valve area was higher among obese patients; however, the indexed area was 
inversely correlated with BMI. Vascular complications and transfusions were more 
common in the low-BMI group, while acute kidney injury was more common in obese
patients. All-cause mortality at 1 year was higher in the low-BMI group (log-rank
p = 0.003) with no significant difference among normal and above-normal BMI
patients. In a multivariate model, BMI <20 kg/m(2) was an independent predictor
of mortality (HR = 2.45, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: BMI <20 kg/m(2) should be considered a frailty marker during the
screening process of severe AS TAVR patients as it is associated with higher
mortality, while obesity confers similar mortality risk as normal weight. © 2015

Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among
the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample
evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the
best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to
remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this
population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive
impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to
transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after
transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and
affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can
increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death
with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney
allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft
utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer
wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to
kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and
propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

Consequences of aging are gaining clinical relevance. In transplantation, aging
and immunosenescence impact treatment and outcomes. The impact of aging, however,
will critically depend on distinguishing healthy, chronological aging from
biological aging that may result into frailty. Approximately 15% of individuals
older than 65 years are frail, and it is expected that this condition will gain
more clinical relevance with an expected increase to greater than 20% over the
next 5 years. Clearly, frailty impacts various general aspects of health care and
organ transplantation in particular including patient selection, waitlist
management and treatment after transplantation. In general, frailty has been
characterized by a compromised physiological reserve and an augmented
vulnerability. In comparison to healthy aging, inflammatory markers and cytokines
are increased in frail older adults. Thus, modifications of the immune response, 
in addition to physical limitations and changes of metabolism, are likely to
impact outcomes after transplantation. Here, we provide a risk assessment of
frailty at the time of transplant evaluation and review effects on outcomes and
recovery after transplantation. Moreover, we summarize our current understanding 
of the pathophysiology of frailty and consequences on immune responses and
metabolism.

Intermediate- or low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis were excluded from
earlier transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) clinical trials; however, 
they are already being treated by TAVI despite a lack of data regarding the
safety and efficacy in these patients. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy
of TAVI in patients at intermediate or low risk. Patients undergoing TAVI during 
2008 to 2014 were included into a shared database (n = 1,327). Procedural
outcomes were adjudicated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 2
definitions. Patients were stratified according to their Society of Thoracic
Surgeons (STS) score into 3 groups: high (STS ≥8, n = 223, 17%), intermediate
(STS 4 to 8; n = 496, 38%), or low risk (STS <4; n = 576, 45%). Low-risk patients
were significantly younger and more likely to be men compared to intermediate-
and high-risk patients. Baseline characteristics differed significantly between
the groups with a gradual increase in the rates of previous bypass surgery,
stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, lung disease, and frailty
scores, from low to high risk groups. Compared with intermediate- and high-risk
patients, low-risk patients were more likely to undergo TAVI through the
transfemoral route (81% vs 88% vs 95%, p <0.001) and under conscious sedation
(69% vs 72% vs 81%, <0.001). There were no significant differences in the rates
of procedural complications apart from acute kidney injury (19% vs 17% vs 13%, p 
= 0.03) and stroke rates (4.5% vs 2% vs 2.3%, p = 0.1). Short- and long-term
mortality rates were significantly higher for intermediate- (hazard ratio [HR]
1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 2.9) and high-risk patients (HR 4.1, 95%
CI 2.7 to 6.4) than low-risk patients also after multivariate adjustment (HR 1.6,
95% CI 1 to 2.6 and HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 4.5, respectively; all p <0.05). In
conclusion, TAVI for intermediate- and low-risk patients is safe and associated
with improved outcome compared with high-risk patients.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the natural history of frailty after an aggressive
surgical intervention, kidney transplantation (KT).
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study (December 2008-March 2014).
SETTING: Baltimore, Maryland.
PARTICIPANTS: Kidney transplantation recipients (N = 349).
MEASUREMENTS: The Fried frailty score was measured at the time of KT and during
routine clinical follow-up. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, factors
associated with improvements in frailty score after KT were identified. Using a
longitudinal analysis, predictors of frailty score changes after KT were
identified using a multilevel mixed-effects Poisson model.
RESULTS: At KT, 19.8% of recipients were frail; 1 month after KT, 33.3% were
frail; at 2 months, 27.7% were frail; and at 3 months, 17.2% were frail. On
average, frailty scores had worsened by 1 month (mean change 0.4, P < .001),
returned to baseline by 2 months (mean change 0.2, P = .07), and improved by 3
months (mean change -0.3, P = .04) after KT. The only recipient or transplant
factor associated with improvement in frailty score after KT was pre-KT frailty
(hazard ratio = 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.71-3.82, P < .001). Pre-KT
frailty status (relative risk (RR) = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.29-1.72, P < .001),
recipient diabetes mellitus (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.08-1.46, P = .003), and
delayed graft function (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04-1.43, P = .02) were
independently associated with long-term changes in frailty score.
CONCLUSION: After KT, in adult recipients of all ages, frailty initially worsens 
but then improves by 3 months. Although KT recipients who were frail at KT had
higher frailty scores over the long term, they were most likely to show
improvements in their physiological reserve after KT, supporting the
transplantation in these individuals and suggesting that pretransplant frailty is
not an irreversible state of low physiological reserve.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

Elderly patients receiving a kidney from old donors (old-to-old) are a growing
population of transplant recipients. This population cumulates risks of
complications due to the co-morbidities and the immunodeficiency state and the
frailty of the recipients together with the kidney senescence of the donors. In
this context, the choice of immunosuppression is complicated and must take into
account some contradictory principles explaining why no consensus exists today.

Stroke prevention in elderly atrial fibrillation patients remains a challenge.
There is a high risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism but also a high risk 
of bleeding if anticoagulants are prescribed. The elderly have increased chronic 
kidney disease, coronary artery disease, polypharmacy, and overall frailty. For
all these reasons, anticoagulant use is underutilized in the elderly. In this
manuscript, the benefits of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared
with warfarin in the elderly patient population with multiple comorbid conditions
are reviewed.

AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to 
complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and
functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total
number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and
assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD
0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified
Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P =
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good
construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the
potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for
patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively validate and compare a modified frailty index
predicting adverse outcomes and other risk stratification tools among patients
undergoing urologic oncological surgeries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program was queried from 2005 to 2013 to identify patients undergoing
cystectomy, prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and nephroureterectomy. Using the
Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index, 11 variables were matched to
the database; 4 were also added because of their relevance in oncology patients. 
The incidence of mortality, Clavien-Dindo IV complications, and adverse events
were assessed with patients grouped according to their modified frailty index
score.
RESULTS: We identified 41,681 patients who were undergoing surgery for presumed
urologic malignancy. Patients with a high frailty index score of >0.20 had a 3.70
odds of a Clavien-Dindo IV event (CI: 2.865-4.788, P<0.0005) and a 5.95 odds of
30-day mortality (CI: 3.72-9.51, P<0.0005) in comparison with nonfrail patients
after adjusting for race, sex, age, smoking history, and procedure. Using
C-statistics to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the predictive ability
of different models per risk stratification tool and the Akaike information
criteria to assess for the fit of the models with the data, the modified frailty 
index was comparable or superior to the Charlson comorbidity index but inferior
to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class in predicting 30-day
mortality or Clavien-Dindo IV events. When the modified frailty index was
augmented with the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class, the new
index was superior in all aspects in comparison to other risk stratification
tools.
CONCLUSION: Existing risk stratification tools may be improved by incorporating
variables in our 15-point modified frailty index as well as other factors such as
walking speed, exhaustion, and sarcopenia to fully assess frailty. This is
relevant in diseases such as kidney and prostate cancer, where surveillance and
other nonsurgical interventions exist as alternatives to a potentially
complicated surgery. In these scenarios, our modified frailty index augmented by 
the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class may help inform which
patients have increased surgical complications that may outweigh the benefit of
surgery although this index needs prospective validation.

Elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years old) use up to 30% of all commonly prescribed
medication, and they suffer more their adverse effects than the general
population. In order to minimize this risk, physicians should avoid polypharmacy,
dangerous pharmacological interactions and take into account pharmacodynamic and 
senile pharmacokinetic changes before prescribing any medication to the elderly. 
The present review article originally describes how renal physiology changes
secondary to aging such as dysautonomia, glomerular filtration rate reduction,
tubular back-filtration, sodium, calcium and magnesium loss, potassium retention,
altered dilution-concentration capability, tubular frailty, genetics, internal
milieu and body composition are senile changes that when combined predispose
elderly people to suffer from pharmacological adverse effects. Knowledge of these
physiological modifications associated with aging and their impact on the
pharmacology of particular drugs may help to optimize drug use and to avoid
complications in this age group.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition 
with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more
frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other
chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in
pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an
outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was
modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was
used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed 
using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.
RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were
significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those 
who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of
frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was
significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower
physical and mental quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in
pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential
role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of
life.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

Body composition in chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are life-threatening
complications after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only
half of CD20-positive PTLDs respond to rituximab monotherapy, and outcomes remain
poor for patients with relapsed/refractory disease, especially those who do not
qualify for an anthracycline containing regimen due to frailty or comorbidities. 
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) might be an option in this particular setting. We report
a panel of eight patients with rituximab refractory/relapsed CD20-positive PTLDs 
including three ineligible for subsequent CHOP-like chemotherapy who received
(90) Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan as a single agent (n = 7) or combined to chemotherapy
(n = 1). Five out of eight patients were kidney transplant recipients, while 2/8 
had a liver transplant and 1/8 had a heart transplant. Patients received a median
of two previous therapies. Overall response rate was 62.5%. Importantly, all
responders achieved complete response. At a median follow-up of 37 months [5;
84], complete response was ongoing in four patients. Toxicity was predominantly
hematological and easily manageable. No graft rejection was noticed concomitantly
or following RIT administration despite immunosuppression reduction after
diagnosis of PTLDs. This report emphasizes the potential efficiency of salvage
RIT for early rituximab refractory PTLDs without any unexpected toxicity.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and
nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney
disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia
are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here.
RECENT FINDINGS: The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among
the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The
association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD 
stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely
associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger
associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy
supplementation combined with low-protein diet for the management of CKD may
prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but
dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis 
therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum
bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23 mEq/l for
nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A
benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven.
SUMMARY: Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and
integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing
comorbidities.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients 
on dialysis; however, previous studies have not taken into account the severity
of frailty as a predictor of outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess if
there was an association between the degree of frailty and mortality among
patients on incident dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A cohort study of incident chronic
dialysis patients was conducted between January of 2009 and June of 2013 (last
follow-up in December of 2013). On the basis of overall clinical impression, the 
Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score was determined for patients at the start of
dialysis by their primary nephrologist. This simple scale allocates a single
point to different states of frailty (1, very fit; 2, well; 3, managing well; 4, 
vulnerable; 5, mildly frail; 6, moderately frail; 7, severely frail or terminally
ill) with an emphasis on function of the assessed individual. The primary outcome
was time to death. Patients were censored at the time of transplantation.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 390 patients with completed CFS scores (mean age
of 63±15 years old). Most were Caucasian (89%) and men (67%), and 30% of patients
had ESRD caused by diabetic nephropathy. The median Charlson Comorbidity Index
score was 4 (interquartile range =3-6), and the median CFS score was 4
(interquartile range =2-5). There were 96 deaths over 750 patient-years at risk. 
In an adjusted Cox survival analysis, the hazard ratio associated with each
1-point increase in the CFS was 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.43;
P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher severity of frailty (as defined by the CFS) at dialysis
initiation is associated with higher mortality.

The geriatric population presents a unique set of challenges in urologic
oncology. In addition to the known natural history of disease, providers must
also consider patient factors such as functional and nutritional status,
comorbidities and social support when determining the treatment plan. The
development of frailty measures and biomarkers to estimate surgical risk shows
promise, with several assessment tools predictive of surgical complications.
Decreased dependence on chronologic age is important when assessing surgical
fitness, as age cutoffs prevent appropriate treatment of many elderly patients
who would benefit from surgery. Within bladder, kidney and prostate cancers,
continued refinement of surgical techniques offers a broader array of options for
the geriatric patient than previously available.

Nephroprevention in the oldest old with chronic kidney disease: Special

Nephroprevention strategies are crucial for handling chronic kidney disease (CKD)
complications, and slowing its progression. However, these preventative measures 
should be guided by major geriatrics principles in order to help nephrologists to
adequately handle the oldest old with CKD. These geriatric concepts consist of
taking into account the relevance of choosing an individualized therapy, handling
clinical frailty, and keeping a geriatric perspective which means that a good
quality of life is sometimes a more important therapeutic objective in
octogenarians than merely prolonging life. Even though nephroprevention
strategies for treating the oldest old with CKD are basically similar to those
applied to younger patients such as low sodium and protein diet, optimized
hemoglobin levels, blood pressure and metabolic control, the treating physician
or care provider must at all times be ready to make fundamental adjustments and
tweak patient care paradigms and objectives if and when the initial therapeutic
options applied have caused unintended clinical consequences and complications.
Additionally, the sarcopenia status should also be evaluated and treated in very 
old CKD patients.

AIM: Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on its impact
on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different
self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these patients has not been
attempted before.
METHODS: A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural centre was
recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered
to these patients. Clinical and dialysis-related laboratory parameters were
collected. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis
complications were performed, and variables demonstrating significant
correlations were entered into multivariate regression models to determine their 
independent associations.
RESULTS: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail
Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and
Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic
dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire showed significant association with each
other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated
significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher Liu's
comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and creatinine
levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The other five
questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important
dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis
identified an independently negative association between serum albumin and the
simple FRAIL scale results (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study establishing the utility of different
self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients.
The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a closer relationship with
dialysis-related complications.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Testosterone among Patients with End-Stage Renal
Disease.

Bao Y(1), Johansen KL.

Author information: 
(1)John Muir Medical Group, Walnut Creek, California.

The prevalence of low testosterone level is particularly high among patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been associated with mortality. In
populations without ESRD, low testosterone level has also been associated with a 
number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low
muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty. However, there
is controversy regarding what constitutes low testosterone level in the aging
population and at what level replacement therapy with testosterone is indicated. 
There are no randomized controlled trials investigating long-term outcomes of
testosterone replacement therapy in populations with or without ESRD. Available
trial results suggest equivocal improvements in sexual function. Muscle mass and 
bone mineral density appear to improve, but results in physical function and
performance are mixed and there are no data on fracture prevention. Some recent
data suggest harm when testosterone was given to men with limited mobility.
Finally, there is little evidence that testosterone adds to existing
erythropoietin agents in the treatment of anemia in ESRD. Due to lack of evidence
supporting long-term use of testosterone, the authors recommend against the
routine use of testosterone in ESRD patients with low testosterone levels.
Testosterone treatment can be considered in those with low bone mass and total
testosterone level <200 ng/dl, or in younger patients with sexual complaints with
total testosterone level lower than the reference range. It is important to
engage patients in discussion of risks and benefits before initiating
testosterone therapy; testosterone therapy should be discontinued if the intended
treatment effect is not observed after short-term use.

We have previously described strong associations between frailty, a measure of
physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, and early
hospital readmission as well as delayed graft function. The goal of this study
was to estimate its association with postkidney transplantation (post-KT)
mortality. Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of
transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional hazards
models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to substantially
improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We
precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of
the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients (n = 37 858) and introduced
these into the single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty
coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5%, 86.0% and 77.5% for nonfrail, 
intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was
independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.01-4.65, p = 0.047) higher
risk of death. In conclusion, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent
risk factor for post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many
confounders using a novel, efficient statistical approach.

Renal functional reserve and renal recovery after acute kidney injury.

Sharma A(1), Mucino MJ, Ronco C.

Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.

Renal functional reserve (RFR) represents the capacity of the kidney to increase 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to certain physiological or
pathological stimuli or conditions. Once baseline GFR is determined, RFR can be
assessed clinically after an oral protein load or intravenous amino acid
infusion. In clinical practice, baseline GFR displays variable levels due to diet
or other factors. RFR is the difference between peak 'stress' GFR induced by the 
test (p.o. or i.v.) and the baseline GFR. In clinical scenarios where
hyperfiltration is present (high baseline GFR due to pregnancy, hypertension or
diabetic nephropathy, in solitary kidney or kidney donors), RFR may be fully or
partially used to achieve normal or supranormal renal function. Since commonly
used renal function markers, such as GFR, may remain within normal ranges until
50% of nephrons are lost or in patients with a single remnant kidney, the RFR
test may represent a sensitive and early way to assess the functional decline in 
the kidney. RFR assessment may become an important tool to evaluate the ability
of the kidney to recover completely or partially after a kidney attack. In case
of healing with a defect and progressive fibrosis, recovery may appear complete
clinically, but a reduced RFR may be a sign of a maladaptive repair or
subclinical loss of renal mass. Thus, a reduction in RFR may represent the
equivalent of renal frailty or susceptibility to insults. The main aim of this
article is to review the concept of RFR, its utility in different clinical
scenarios, and future perspective for its use.

Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults in Primary and Secondary Care.

The Renal National Service Framework (NSF), and the subsequent NICE Clinical
Practice Guideline for early identification and management of adults with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) in primary and secondary care (CG73), served to emphasise
the change in focus in renal medicine from treatment of established kidney
disease to earlier identification and prevention of kidney disease. CKD describes
abnormal kidney function and/or structure. It is common, frequently unrecognised 
and often coexists with other conditions (for example, cardiovascular disease and
diabetes). Moderate to severe CKD also carries an increased risk of other
significant adverse outcomes such acute kidney injury, falls, frailty and
mortality. The risk of developing CKD increases with increasing age, and some
conditions that coexist with CKD become more severe and increasingly prevalent as
kidney dysfunction advances. CKD can progress to end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD)in a small but significant percentage of people. CKD is usually
asymptomatic but it is detectable, and tests for detecting CKD are both simple
and freely available. There is evidence that treatment can prevent or delay the
progression of CKD, reduce or prevent the development of complications and reduce
the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, because of a lack of specific
symptoms, CKD frequently remains undetected and unrecognised. As a consequence
people with CKD are often not diagnosed, or diagnosed late when CKD is at an
advanced stage. Late diagnosis is associated with increased morbidity, mortality 
and healthcare associated costs.

AIMS: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) represents a less invasive
treatment option for elderly patients. Therefore, we aimed to determine the
impact of frailty measured by the Katz Index of activities of daily living (ADL) 
on short- and long-term mortality after TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Our study included 300 consecutive patients (mean age, 82±5 
years) who had undergone TAVI at our institution (158 transapical, 142
transfemoral procedures). At baseline, 144 patients were impaired in at least one
ADL and therefore defined as frail (Katz Index <6). Regarding in-hospital
outcome, all serious complications except for stage 3 acute kidney injury were
equally distributed in both groups, but early mortality was significantly higher 
in frail persons (5.5% vs. 1.3%, p=0.04 for immediate procedural mortality; 17%
vs. 5.8%, p=0.002 for 30-day mortality; and 23% vs. 6.4%, p<0.0001 for procedural
mortality). The risk-score-based 30-day mortality estimates (29% vs. 24% for log.
EuroSCORE I, 9.5% vs. 7.5% for EuroSCORE II, and 8.8% vs. 5.9% for STS score)
reflected neither the observed 30-day mortality in both groups nor the threefold 
risk elevation in frail patients. In contrast, the Katz Index <6 was identified
as a significant independent predictor of long-term all-cause mortality by
multivariate analysis (HR 2.67 [95% CI: 1.7-4.3], p<0.0001). During follow-up
(median observation period 537 days) 56% of frail vs. 24% of non-frail patients
died.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty status measured by the Katz Index represents a powerful
predictor of adverse early and late outcome after TAVI, whereas commonly used
risk scores lack calibration and discrimination in a TAVI-specific patient
cohort. Therefore, we propose the incorporation of this simple and reproducible
measure into pre-TAVI risk assessment.

Clinical relevance of sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis.

The most commonly recognized complications in cirrhotic patients include ascites,
hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, susceptibility for infections, kidney 
dysfunction, and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, severe muscle wasting or
sarcopenia are the most common and frequently unseen complications which
negatively impact survival, quality of life, and response to stressor, such as
infections and surgeries. At present, D'Amico stage classification, Child-Pugh,
and MELD scores constitute the best tools to predict mortality in patients with
cirrhosis; however, one of their main limitations is the lack of assessing the
nutritional and functional status. Currently, numerous methods are available to
evaluate the nutrition status of the cirrhotic patient; nevertheless, most of
these techniques have limitations primarily because lack of objectivity,
reproducibility, and prognosis discrimination. In this regard, an objective and
reproducible technique, such as muscle mass quantification with cross-sectional
imaging studies (computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging)
constitute an attractive index of nutritional status in cirrhosis. Sarcopenia is 
part of the frailty complex present in cirrhotic patients, resulting from
cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and characterized by
impaired functional capacity, decreased reserve, resistance to stressors, and
predisposition to poor outcomes. In this review, we discuss the current accepted 
and new methods to evaluate prognosis in cirrhosis. Also, we analyze the current 
knowledge regarding incidence and clinical impact of malnutrition and sarcopenia 
in patients with cirrhosis and their impact after liver transplantation. Finally,
we discuss existing and potential novel therapeutic approaches for malnutrition
in cirrhosis, emphasizing the recognition of sarcopenia in an effort to reduced
morbidity related and improved survival in cirrhosis.

Hemodialysis (HD) is routinely offered to patients with end-stage renal disease
in the United States who are ineligible for other renal replacement modalities.
The frequency of HD among the US population is greater than all other countries, 
except Taiwan and Japan. In US, patients are often dialyzed irrespective of age, 
comorbidities, prognosis, or decision-making capacity. Determination of when
patients can no longer dialyze is variable and can be dialysis-center specific.
Determinants may be related to progressive comorbidities and frailty, mobility or
access issues, patient self-determination, or an inability to tolerate the
treatment safely for any number of reasons (e.g., hypotension, behavioral
issues). Behavioral issues may impact the safety of not only patients themselves,
but also those around them. In this article the authors present the case of an
elderly patient on HD with progressive cognitive impairment and combative
behavior placing him and others at risk of physical harm. The authors discuss the
medical, ethical, legal, and psychosocial challenges to care of such patients who
lack decision-making capacity with a focus on variable approaches by regions and 
culture. This manuscript provides recommendations and highlights resources to
assist nephrologists, dialysis personnel, ethics consultants, and palliative
medicine teams in managing such patients to resolve conflict.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among elderly people is
increasing. Often associated with disabilities/comorbidities, T2DM lowers the
chances of successful aging and is independently associated with frailty and an
increased risk of hypoglycaemia, which can be further exacerbated by
antihyperglycaemic treatment. From this perspective, the clinical management of
T2DM in the elderly is challenging and requires individualization of optimum
glycaemic targets depending on comorbidities, cognitive functioning and ability
to recognize and self-manage the disease. The lack of solid evidence-based
medicine supporting treatment guidelines for older people with diabetes further
complicates the matter. Several classes of medicine for the treatment of T2DM are
currently available and different drug combinations are often required to achieve
individualized glycaemic goals. Many of these drugs, however, carry disadvantages
such as the propensity to cause weight gain or hypoglycaemia. Dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, a recent addition to the pharmacological
armamentarium, have become widely accepted in clinical practice because of their 
efficacy, low risk of hypoglycaemia, neutral effect on body weight, and
apparently greater safety in patients with kidney failure. Although more
information is needed to reach definitive conclusions, growing evidence suggests 
that DPP-4 inhibitors may become a valuable component in the pharmacological
management of elderly people with T2DM. The present review aims to delineate the 
potential advantages of this pharmacological approach in the treatment of elderly
people with T2DM.

BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides
(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

Thoughtful decision-making in a patient with cancer and kidney disease requires a
comprehensive discussion of prognosis and therapy options for both conditions
framed by the individual's preferences and goals of care. An estimate of overall 
prognosis is generated that includes the patient's clinical presentation and
parameters associated with adverse outcomes, such as age, performance status,
frailty, malnutrition, and comorbidities. Empathic communication of this
information using a shared decision-making approach can lead to an informed
decision that respects patient autonomy and is consistent with the patient's
"big-picture" goals and personal values.

Uric acid (UA) is produced from purines by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, and
elevated levels may cause arthritis and kidney stones. Conversely, UA also
appears to function as an antioxidant and may protect against the oxidative
stress associated with aging and disease. We performed a prospective fracture
case-cohort study to understand the relation of UA and fracture risk in older men
enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. In the cohort of 5994
men aged 65 years and older attending the baseline MrOS examination, we evaluated
a subgroup 1680 men in a case-cohort study design. The analytic group included
387 men with incident nonspine fractures (73 hip) and a random sample of 1383.
Serum UA was measured in baseline serum samples. Modified proportional hazards
models that account for case-cohort study design were used to estimate the
relative hazards (RH) of hip and nonspine fracture in men for serum UA. Models
were adjusted for age, race, clinic site, body mass index, vitamin D, parathyroid
hormone, walking speed, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score,
frailty, and total. Subjects with incident nonspine fractures were older, had
lower total hip bone mineral density (BMD), and higher serum phosphorus. There
was an 18% decreased risk of nonspine fractures (95% confidence interval [CI]
0.71-0.93; p = 0.003) per 1 SD increase of baseline serum and 34% decreased risk 
of nonspine fractures in quartile 4 of UA versus quartiles 1, 2, and 3 (95% CI
0.49-0.89; p = 0.028) compared with nonfracture cases after multivariate
adjustment. Hip fractures were not significantly associated with UA. Total hip
BMD was significantly higher in the group of men with high UA levels compared
with lower UA levels and increased linearly across quartiles of UA after
multivariate adjustment (p for trend = 0.002). In summary, higher serum UA levels
were associated with a reduction in risk of incident nonspine fractures but not
hip fractures and higher hip BMD.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical
function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness
and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a
heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of
this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general
population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science,
CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD
and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text
review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. 
From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in
patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with
increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. 
In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher 
risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished
physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may 
lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to
understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with
clinical outcomes.

Although the management of diabetes as a simple entity has been extensively
developed, there is a dearth of evidence in elderly, frail patients with multiple
comorbidities and polymedication. This population represents a large proportion
of the residents of nursing homes (NHs). As a multidisciplinary group of French
experts (geriatricians, endocrinologists, diabetologists, and general
practitioners) with practical experience in this area, which is growing in
magnitude throughout the world, we convened to compile pragmatic, simple advice
on the management of elderly, frail diabetic patients. Given demands on NH
personnel (manager, medical coordinator, nurses, and, at the front line of care
provision, the undertrained and overworked carers), coupled with the
quasiconstant of high staff turnover, the foundation stone of a patient's
diabetes management is an Individual Care Plan (ICP) expressed in layman's
language. This document that is opened on the patient's admission aims to make
sure that the prescriptions established at admission are followed, notably to
ensure correct treatment and adapted, regular monitoring with dates and times
when examinations and tests are due. This includes monitoring of the diabetes
control (HbA1c and, if necessary, blood and urine glucose) and its complications 
(cardiovascular disease, hypoglycemia, ocular problems, foot disorders,
malnutrition, peripheral neuropathy, kidney failure). A necessary corollary is
the training of staff to understand the specificities of caring for a frail
patient with diabetes, on what to do in a potential emergency, and how to keep
the ICP up to date for consultation by doctors and nurses.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether higher cystatin C would be associated with
greater frailty in men aged 65 and older.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study.
SETTING: Six U.S. sites.
PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of community-dwelling men aged 65 and older
enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study (mean age 73.8; 9.8%
frail and 47.2% intermediate frailty; N = 1,602).
MEASUREMENTS: Serum cystatin C, creatinine, and frailty were measured. Frailty
was analyzed as an ordinal outcome of robust, intermediate frailty, and frail
using a multinomial logistic regression model, and the base model was adjusted
for age, race, and clinical site.
RESULTS: Higher cystatin C was associated with seven times greater odds of being 
frail than being robust (odds ratio (OR) quartile 4 vs 1 = 7.12, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 3.76-13.46) and 2.4 times greater odds of intermediate frailty
than robust (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.70-3.32). The association was 
attenuated but persisted after adjusting for multiple possible confounders. In
contrast, neither higher serum creatinine (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.36, 95% CI =
0.78-2.40) nor lower creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR
quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.54-1.87) was associated in a graded manner
with greater odds of frailty.
CONCLUSION: Higher cystatin C, but not creatinine-based measures, was associated 
with greater odds of frailty in this cohort of older men.

An appropriate treatment of elderly rheumatic patients implements comprehensive
diagnostics and exclusion diagnostics of e.g. coronary heart disease,
osteoporosis, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2 and thyroid gland
dysfunction. Furthermore, the complex disease situation might require the
integration of other faculties or might be a reason for inpatient treatment. The 
complexity in the treatment of multimorbid elderly patients suffering from
rheumatism not only rises with increasing age but also constitutes a considerable
challenge due to existing incapacities and preceding as well as currently
performed immunosuppressive therapies. The necessary treatment framework is
outlined from the perspective of rheumatologists and geriatricians. Typical
geriatric symptoms, such as malnutrition, immobility and frailty might be
enhanced if multimorbidity is simultaneously present.

Bone fracture risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher
than that in healthy subjects. Frailty caused by neuromuscular impairment as well
as bone fragility due to bone loss and impaired bone quality is thought to be
involved in the elevated fracture risk in CKD. Altered material and structural
properties might be attributed to the reduced bone strength. The structural
properties in CKD patients are characterized in 1) cortical thinning and cortical
porosity, and 2) irregular thickening and loss of connectivity in trabecular
bone. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that skeletal changes in the
structural properties may be initiated at earlier stage of CKD than we expected.

Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of
Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and
catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate
with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and
provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of
PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology
of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition)
due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent 
factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include
uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent
inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of
hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition,
comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the
dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW.

We present the case and radiologic images of an 85-year-old woman who presented
with a left loin abscess secondary to a left staghorn calculus and a
nonfunctioning left kidney. We examined the rationale behind the eventual
decision to pursue conservative treatment in the form of incision and drainage
rather than nephrectomy. This was because of the patient's frailty and the
presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in close proximity to the left kidney.
The radiologic images are of great quality and interest because they display the 
pathologic findings very clearly. Our brief case report outlines the
decision-making process.

BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in management have been highlighted as contributory
factors in the death of many patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). However,
there is little evidence addressing the quality of care provided to patients with
milder AKI.
AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of care provided to a
non-select cohort of patients with AKI and evaluate discrepancies in causation,
recognition and management.
DESIGN: Retrospective inception cohort study.
METHODS: Demographic data were collected for all 1577 patients admitted to a
University Teaching Hospital during a 1-month period. Baseline, admission and
peak creatinine were correlated with mortality and length of hospital admission. 
AKI was classified according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
criteria. A retrospective case note review of all patients with AKI was carried
out to evaluate quality of documentation and clinical management of AKI.
Multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors for AKI.
RESULTS: Incidence of AKI on admission was 4.6%. A further 10.3% developed AKI
while in hospital. All cause mortality was 4-fold higher among patients with AKI 
compared with those without (19 vs. 3.8%; P < 0.001). Mortality was significantly
higher in those patients who developed AKI while an in-patient compared with
those with AKI on admission (27.3 vs. 11.8%; P < 0.001). Diabetes, clinician
perception of frailty, age and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor prior to admission were found to be independent risk factors for AKI.
AKI was unrecognized in 23.5% of patients, two-thirds of whom were discharged
without resolution of renal function. Significant weaknesses in management were
poorly kept fluid balance charts (48.2%), failure to withhold nephrotoxic drugs
(38.8%) and failure to act upon abnormal biochemistry (41%) in a timely fashion.
CONCLUSION: AKI is common in hospitalized patients and associated with a
significant increase in hospital stay and mortality. AKI is often found in
conjunction with other organ failure and in many cases is not preventable.
Nevertheless clinicians need to be more vigilant of small creatinine rises to
permit early intervention particularly among elderly and frail patients.

Older people constitute an increasingly greater proportion of patients with
advanced CKD, including those patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment.
Frailty is a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors
that results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and
causes vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty is common in elderly CKD
patients, and it may be associated with protein-energy wasting (PEW), sarcopenia,
dynapenia, and other complications of CKD. Causes of frailty with or without PEW 
in the elderly with CKD can be classified into three categories: causes primarily
caused by aging per se, advanced CKD per se, or a combination of both conditions.
Frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients are associated with impaired physical
performance, disability, poorer quality of life, and reduced survival. Prevention
and treatment of these conditions in the elderly CKD patients often require a
multifaceted approach. Here, we examine the causes and consequences of these
conditions and examine the interplay between frailty and PEW in elderly CKD
patients.

The end-stage renal disease population is aging. Nearly half of all new patients 
are older than 65 years and one third are older than 70 years. Assessing the
possibility of transplantation for older patients with end-stage renal disease
often involves contemplating more complex issues, including cognitive impairment,
decreased functional status, and frailty, which makes selecting appropriate
candidates more difficult. Older transplant recipients have decreased patient and
transplant survival compared with younger recipients. For example, 75% of
deceased donor transplant recipients aged 30-49 years are alive after 5 years
compared to only 61% for those older than 65 years. Despite poorer outcomes
compared with younger recipients, older transplant recipients have a significant 
improvement in survival compared with similar patients who remain on the wait
list, with decreases in mortality of 41%-61% depending on the study. Use of
living donors, even older living donors, provides significantly better outcomes
for elderly recipients compared with the use of deceased donors. However, in the 
absence of a living donor, survival is improved significantly by accepting an
expanded criteria donor organ rather than waiting for a standard criteria
deceased donor. Older transplant recipients experience more infectious
complications and less acute rejection, but the risk of transplant loss from
rejection is increased compared with younger patients. These immunologic issues, 
along with the fact that older patients often are excluded from transplant
trials, have made selecting an ideal immunosuppressive regimen challenging.
Prospective comparative trials of different agents in the elderly population are 
warranted to better define the risk-benefit profile. This review discusses
transplantation outcomes, including patient and transplant survival, different
donor types, quality of life, and immunosuppression for older dialysis patients.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor is
recommended for use as first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary
syndromes (ACS) who undergo high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention.
However, revascularization may not be a beneficial option for some subgroups of
patients with ACS. This includes a broad spectrum of lower risk patients as well 
as high-risk patients with numerous previous revascularizations and those who are
at high risk for complications, such as those with complex coronary anatomy and
co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or advanced age
and frailty. For such patients, there remains an unmet need for evaluation of
alternatives to the currently recommended treatment options. Notably, there is a 
paucity of prospective data regarding management approaches to medically managed 
patients with ACS. Thus, this group of medically managed patients with ACS would 
benefit from inclusion in clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for
patients not scheduled to undergo invasive procedures, such as those who are
targeted for pharmacologic management only. In conclusion, in this review, the
investigators revisit data from clinical studies of dual-antiplatelet therapy in 
ACS to highlight areas of unmet need in antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS
and to examine the use of newer agents in subgroups, such as medically managed
patients with ACS, that would potentially benefit from more potent platelet
inhibition after ACS.

Next to a high morbidity, patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) suffer
from a complex spectrum of clinical manifestations. Both the phenotype of
patients with ESRD as well as the pathophysiology of uremia show interesting
parallels with the general aging process. Phenotypically, patients with ESRD have
an increased susceptibility for both cardiovascular as well as infectious disease
and show a reduction in functional capacity as well as muscular mass
(sarcopenia), translating into a high prevalence of frailty also in younger
patients. Pathophysiologically, the immune dysfunction, telomere attrition and
the presence of low-grade inflammation in uremic patients also show parallels
with the aging process. System models of aging, such as the homeodynamic model
and reliability theory of Gavrilov may also have relevance for ESRD. The
reduction in the redundancy of compensatory mechanisms and the multisystem
impairment in ESRD explain the rapid loss of homeodynamic/homeostatic balance and
the increased susceptibility to external stressors in these patients. System
theories may also explain the relative lack of success of interventions focusing 
on single aspects of renal disease. The concept of accelerated aging, which also 
shares similarities with other organ diseases, may be of relevance both for a
better understanding of the uremic process, as well as for the design of
multidimensional interventions in ESRD patients, including an important role for 
early rehabilitation. Research into processes akin to both aging and uremia may
result in novel therapeutic approaches.

Intensive hemodialysis in the (nursing) home: the bright side of geriatric ESRD
care?

Elderly ESRD patients often lose functionality when they start dialysis, which
may be due to a variety of clinical problems. We recently postulated that
intensive (longer and/or more frequent) hemodialysis (HD) may be the ideal
strategy to try to prevent these ESRD- and dialysis-related complications,
including dialysis-induced hypotension, cardiac and cerebral events,
malnutrition, infections, sleep problems, and psychological issues. The
feasibility of home dialysis therapies has been demonstrated in observational
studies. As self-care dialysis is often a challenge in the elderly patient,
assisted intensive home HD may facilitate the long-term continuation of this
modality. Intensive nursing home HD seems to be an attractive goal for the future
because many elderly ESRD patients reside in an extended care facility.
Combination with rehabilitation and support by social worker and psychologist
remains crucial in the holistic approach toward the elderly ESRD patient. Further
studies are required to test the potential protective effects of intensive HD on 
functionality and quality of life in elderly ESRD patients, and to elucidate the 
mechanisms underlying frailty and other geriatric syndromes in this highly
vulnerable patient population.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the impact of frailty in older adults
undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for symptomatic aortic
stenosis.
BACKGROUND: Frailty status impacts prognosis in older adults with heart disease; 
however, the impact of frailty on prognosis after TAVR is unknown.
METHODS: Gait speed, grip strength, serum albumin, and activities of daily living
status were collected at baseline and used to derive a frailty score among
patients who underwent TAVR procedures at a single large-volume institution. The 
cohort was dichotomized on the basis of median frailty score into frail and not
frail groups. The impact of frailty on procedural outcomes (stroke, bleeding,
vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and mortality at 30 days) and 1-year
mortality was evaluated.
RESULTS: Frailty status was assessed in 159 subjects who underwent TAVR (age 86 ±
8 years, Society of Thoracic Surgery Risk Score 12 ± 4). Baseline frailty score
was not associated with conventionally ascertained clinical variables or Society 
of Thoracic Surgery score. Although high frailty score was associated with a
longer post-TAVR hospital stay when compared with lower frailty score (9 ± 6 days
vs. 6 ± 5 days, respectively, p = 0.004), there were no significant crude
associations between frailty status and procedural outcomes, suggesting adequacy 
of the standard selection process for identifying patients at risk for
periprocedural complications after TAVR. Frailty status was independently
associated with increased 1-year mortality (hazard ratio: 3.5, 95% confidence
interval: 1.4 to 8.5, p = 0.007) after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was not associated with increased periprocedural
complications in patients selected as candidates to undergo TAVR but was
associated with increased 1-year mortality after TAVR. Further studies will
evaluate the independent value of this frailty composite in older adults with
aortic stenosis.

Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease among older adults: a focus on the oldest 
old.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 
(KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation,
Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of
kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease
to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of
older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress
to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific
cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older
adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have
shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated 
with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis)
and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally
thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes 
include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research
studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD 
and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the
longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the
oldest old with CKD.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a physiological vulnerability status of the patient
which is associated with the increased number of hospitalization and death.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of frailty and its associated factors in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on conservative treatment (CT),
hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).
METHODS: Frailty was assessed in 146 patients (86 CT, 37 HD and 23 PD) and
characterized as muscle weakness and exhaustion--by the physical aspect and
vitality domains, respectively, evaluated in the SF-36 quality of life
instrument; physical inactivity--if he or she answered "never" or "hardly ever"
when asked about physical activity; and as unintentional weight loss (> 4.5 kg
per year). Patients were divided into three groups: non-fragile (NF), pre-fragile
(PF) and fragile (F). The demographic, clinical and laboratory data were
extracted from patient charts.
RESULTS: Frailty was diagnosed in 36% of patients on CT, 37.8% in HD and 47.8% in
PD. It was characterized in 36.8% of patients aged between 20 and 40 years and
40.3% of those between 41 and 60 years. Frailty was significantly associated with
the use of vitamin D (r = 0.16; p = 0.03), hemoglobin (r = -0.14; p = - 0.02) and
intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.16; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is common among patients with CKD on conservative treatment 
and dialysis, even in those who are not elderly. In the patients studied, the
phenotype of frailty was associated with no usage of vitamin D, lower serum
levels of hemoglobin and higher levels of parathyroid hormone.

BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and
its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we
hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between
earlier dialysis initiation and mortality.
METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis
Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident
patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for
vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization
through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the 
association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards
regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization.
RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73%.
In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with 
higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25-1.97]; P < .001) and time to first
hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45]; P < .001). While higher eGFR at
dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23]
per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically
significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the 
United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation.
Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier
initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described
association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.

BACKGROUND: Organ dysfunctions and medical complications, such as renal failure, 
liver impairment, coagulation disorders, cardiovascular and respiratory
illnesses, may hamper an adequate pain management in haematological patients.
AIM: To summarize current knowledge on pain management in hematological patients 
presenting major organ dysfunctions and comorbidity. We also attempted to provide
recommendations to optimize analgesia and to minimize side effects in the setting
of medically compromised and frail haematological patients.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literature, using relevant key words, was
conducted in PubMed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Pain in hematological patients is a common symptom and
is often multi-factorial. Most pharmacotherapeutic measures, including causal
therapies, analgesics and adjuvant agents routinely applied in pain management,
may also be used in the setting of clinical frailty and medical comorbidities;
however, comprehensive clinical and functional patient's evaluations and a
careful consideration of expected benefits and potential adverse events are
required.

Older patients on dialysis have unique needs and characteristics and their
outcomes vary from that of their younger counterparts. Comparatively fewer will
start or be maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to younger patients, 
despite the fact that hemodialysis is often poorly tolerated. Barriers to PD for 
older patients include poor vision, frailty, cognitive dysfunction, accommodation
issues, and a bias from renal teams that older patients cannot do PD. The
development of assisted PD can overcome many of these barriers. The ability of
older patients to use PD as their dialysis modality should not be determined by
whether they live in an area where the nephrologist is a PD enthusiast. All
patients should be given nonbiased information so they can choose the dialysis
modality that gives them the best quality of life and suits their and their
family's lifestyle.

Recent publications not only underline the risks of age and disease during
surgery but also help us quantify the risks with greater precision. Importantly, 
patient factors often have a stronger association with postoperative mortality
than surgical factors. Important factors preoperatively are: age, American
Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) physical status, emergency surgery, and plasma
albumin concentration. There is emerging work on quantifying frailty as a further
risk factor for perioperative complication and mortality as well as need for
higher level of care after discharge from hospital. Important postoperative
complications include sepsis and kidney injury. Preventing, detecting and
managing complications and mortality is the greatest challenge facing those
caring for surgical patients, including anaesthetists. Evidence for the long term
effects of perioperative complications adds further importance to minimizing
perioperative complications. Newer approaches in patient care, particularly
co-management during the postoperative phase by different specialities are
emerging. Managing high-risk patients should also be enhanced with greater
surveillance and more rapid and appropriate response; ensuring we do not fail to 
rescue our patients.

INTRODUCTION: Many transplant studies in elderly patients focus on survival and
mortality rates. It was the aim of this review to evaluate publications dealing
with individual patient performance and independence.
METHODS: The literature search included all articles retrievable for the hit
"transplantation in elderly recipients" between 1960 and 2010. For quality search
the inclusion criteria were as follows: older than 60 years and transplanted
kidney, liver, heart, lung or pancreas from a deceased or living donor. We
focussed on parameters concerning quality of life, frailty, nutritional
status/weight loss, drugs/interactions/polypharmacy, gait/osteoporosis/fracture, 
delirium/dementia and geriatric assessment to address physical and psychosocial
functionality of elderly recipients.
RESULTS: The initial hit list contained 1427 citations from electronic databases.
249 abstracts thereof were selected for full review. A total of 60 articles met
final inclusion criteria. Finally, only five studies met the qualitative
inclusion criteria as listed above.
CONCLUSION: The number of elderly patients placed on waiting lists has increased 
dramatically and will further grow. Interdisciplinary collaboration and distinct 
patient selection is recommended in most of the studies. However, data concerning
quality of life and related parameters in elderly transplant recipients are rare.

Often, one gathers together under the denomination "peritoneal dialysis" patients
with various clinical profiles. To quantify this "heterogeneity" we analysed the 
clinical characteristics of 32,975 patients treated by dialysis at 31 December
2008 in 22 French regions, participating to the REIN registry. This
cross-sectional study confirms our initial hypothesis of a great heterogeneity of
patients' profiles in peritoneal dialysis. As in hemodialysis, there is a
gradation between modalities: from assisted continuous ambulatory peritoneal
dialysis which concerns the frailty patients to autonomous automated peritoneal
dialysis for more healthy patients, through assisted automated peritoneal
dialysis and autonomous continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.

Thyroid hormone abnormalities and frailty in elderly patients with chronic kidney
disease: a hypothesis.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults,
affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are
encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap
with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder 
may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded
in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed 
to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is
being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization
and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low
testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of
whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly
CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In
this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone
abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with
CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors 
predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and
treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
importance.

Nephrologists care for an increasing number of elderly patients on hemodialysis. 
As such, an understanding of the overlap among complications of hemodialysis and 
geriatric syndromes is crucial. This article reviews hemodialysis management
issues including vascular access, hypertension, anemia and bone and mineral
disorders with an attention towards the distinct medical needs of the elderly.
Key concepts of geriatrics frailty, dementia and palliative care are also
discussed, as nephrologists frequently participate in decision-making directed
toward balancing longevity, functional status and the burden of therapy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

Older adults (aged >or=65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD
population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging.
Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the
frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among
vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical 
performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death.
Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits 
seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a
highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the
trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed 
to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to
identify opportunities to intervene.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney
disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated
criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to 
determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were
associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the
association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly
increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for
the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds 
of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation,
vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and
chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney
disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.
Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection
remain elusive.

Already from its early decades, peritoneal dialysis (PD) has proved to be
efficient and able to confer similar or better chronic patient survival in
comparison with hemodialysis (HD). More recent years allowed many PD therapy
advances with further outcomes improvement: mortality, hospitalizations and
clinical complications all have been reduced across patient's vintages. Adequacy 
parameters of PD also compare advantageously with the erroneously named
'high-efficiency' HD which is now facing the limitations of intermittent
procedures, frailty of KT/V as measure of adequacy, importance of sustained fluid
removal and time of dialysis. Adequacy should also include life satisfaction and 
PD also compares favorably as a home therapy. The best approach, also the most
intelligent and cost-effective, would be not to underestimate a different
therapy, but discover how complementary it can be for success of long term
patient treatment.

The majority of colorectal cancer patients receive chemotherapy either to
palliate advanced unresectable disease or to reduce the risk of recurrence after 
radical surgery. Thanks to the improvements in systemic chemotherapy, in the last
20 years the median survival time for patients with unresectable metastatic
disease has indeed progressively increased from less than 6 to almost 24 months
and recurrences after radical surgery in patients with early-stage tumors have
been halved. Although colorectal cancer incidence increase with aging, there is
limited scientific evidence based on prospective clinical trials to guide the
management of elderly colorectal cancer patients. In addition, aging is a
continuum process making strict cut-off difficult to define and homogeneous
subgroups hard to identify. There is significant heterogeneity also as regards
comorbidities, overall physical ability, mental health and functional status.
Specific guidelines for the medical treatment of elderly colorectal cancer
patients are therefore difficult to draw. While fit patients are generally
treated with adult protocols and frail individuals rarely receive chemotherapy,
managing the intermediate vulnerable patients requires a careful balance between 
the biological and psycho-social costs of treatment, the aggressiveness of the
tumor and its perception by the patient. In this review, the major achievements
of chemotherapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer will be described and the
available data addressing the extension of these chemotherapy programs to elderly
patients will be discussed. Special emphasis will be given to the development of 
specific treatment strategies depending on the degree of disease aggressiveness. 
Empirical suggestions to adapt the chemotherapy programs developed for adult fit 
patients to subjects with various degrees of vulnerability and frailty will also 
be given along with practical indications for the use of specific
chemotherapeutic agents in the presence of some common elderly-related
comorbidities.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is an emergent health-related problem in older adults. The aim
of this study was to examine the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and the
effect of frailty in elderly patients with cardiometabolic risk factors.
METHODS: One-hundred and one patients 65 years or older responded to an HRQOL
assessment using the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-26
questionnaire. Frailty was assessed using two indices: the Hebrew Rehabilitation 
Center for Aged (HRCA) vulnerability index and the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES)
index. In addition, these patients completed self-rating questionnaires assessing
mental well-being [the 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire
(GHQ-28)] and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale).
RESULTS: Based on the combination of HRCA and VES indices, 24 subjects (23.7%)
met the criteria of frail. Persons > or = 75 years old and those with depressive 
mood or lower creatinine clearance had significantly lower WHOQOL-26 scores than 
their counterparts. Diabetes and macrovascular complications did not associate
with the WHOQOL-26 scores. Compared with non-frail patients, the frail scored
lower on the WHOQOL-26 questionnaire after adjusting for age, kidney dysfunction 
and depressive mood. Frail patients also reported significantly higher the GHQ-28
scores compared with non-frail patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail older adults had a significant lower HRQOL, as well as lower
mental well-being, independent of age, diabetes, macrovascular complication,
kidney dysfunction and depressed mood.

Highly active antiretroviral treatment has resulted in dramatically increased
life expectancy among patients with HIV infection who are now aging while
receiving treatment and are at risk of developing chronic diseases associated
with advanced age. Similarities between aging and the courses of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
suggest that HIV infection compresses the aging process, perhaps accelerating
comorbidities and frailty. In a workshop organized by the Association of
Specialty Professors, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the HIV Medical
Association, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute on
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, researchers in infectious diseases, geriatrics, 
immunology, and gerontology met to review what is known about HIV infection and
aging, to identify research gaps, and to suggest high priority topics for future 
research. Answers to the questions posed are likely to help prioritize and
balance strategies to slow the progression of HIV infection, to address
comorbidities and drug toxicity, and to enhance understanding about both HIV
infection and aging.

Dedicated European and US clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes in the elderly 
have been released, but they do not specifically address the issue of advanced
chronic kidney disease (CKD) in older patients with diabetes. General clinical
guidelines have been published on the treatment of patients with diabetic
nephropathy (DN), but these address the issue of how to prevent progression and
treat advanced DN without distinguishing between different age groups. Elderly
patients with diabetes and stages 3 to 4 CKD have particular needs that differ
from those of younger patients with the same conditions. This is mainly due to
their frailty and shorter life expectancy. Differently tailored therapeutic
strategies are needed, which may have less stringent targets; and the use of
common drugs should be critically evaluated. The management agenda (metabolic
control, low-protein diet, controlling BP, preventing progression of advanced DN,
preventing cardiovascular outcomes) for these patients is discussed in light of
the limits and perspectives of current guidelines. Intensive, simultaneous
management of all items on the agenda may not be feasible for a proportion of
older patients, and clinicians may have to give priority to reducing some risk
factors rather than others, choosing between different therapies.

New advances in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) change the
perspective from which many of its features and treatment are viewed. Calcium,
phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D have been shown to be
important determinants of survival associated with kidney diseases. Now ROD
dependent and independent of these factors is linked to survival more than just
skeletal frailty. This review focuses on recent discoveries that renal injury
impairs skeletal anabolism decreasing the osteoblast compartment of the skeleton 
and consequent bone formation. This discovery and the discovery that PTH
regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche alters our view of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) from that of a disease to
that of a necessary adaptation to renal injury that goes awry. Furthermore, ROD
is shown to be an underappreciated factor in the level of the serum phosphorus in
CKD. The discovery and the elucidation of the mechanism of hyperphosphatemia as a
cardiovascular risk in CKD change the view of ROD. It is now recognized as more
than a skeletal disorder, it is an important component of the mortality of CKD
that can be treated.

Semiparametric analysis of correlated recurrent and terminal events.

In clinical and observational studies, recurrent event data (e.g.,
hospitalization) with a terminal event (e.g., death) are often encountered. In
many instances, the terminal event is strongly correlated with the recurrent
event process. In this article, we propose a semiparametric method to jointly
model the recurrent and terminal event processes. The dependence is modeled by a 
shared gamma frailty that is included in both the recurrent event rate and
terminal event hazard function. Marginal models are used to estimate the
regression effects on the terminal and recurrent event processes, and a Poisson
model is used to estimate the dispersion of the frailty variable. A sandwich
estimator is used to achieve additional robustness. An analysis of
hospitalization data for patients in the peritoneal dialysis study is presented
to illustrate the proposed method.

A gradual diminution in the physiologic reserve or functional capacity over time 
is the characteristic hallmark of aging, and this has a direct impact on the
choice of cancer therapy and its toxicity profile in elderly patients with
cancer. With the expected rapid rise of the older population as a subgroup,
oncologists will increasingly treat elderly patients. Provision of competent care
to this increasing pool of older patients with cancer necessitates that oncology 
professionals become familiar with age-associated changes in organ physiology and
their impact on cancer treatment and toxicity. In this comprehensive review, we
have listed changes in cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and renal
physiology with aging. Also enumerated is the impact of these changes on cancer
therapy and toxicity in each organ system-based section. Cardiovascular changes
primarily lead to reduction of the cardiac functional reserve, with a consequent 
increase in the risk of congestive heart failure. Changes in gastrointestinal
physiology lead to increased mucosal damage. A reduction in pulmonary reserve has
implications for postradiation complications, and a decline in renal function
leads to an increased potential for nephrotoxicity. These changes impair the
ability of older patients with cancer to tolerate cancer therapy and increase
their risk of toxicities. This may lead to an overall decline in functional
status, resulting frailty, poor quality of life, and ultimately poor outcomes.
Becoming familiar with age-related physiologic changes is the first step for
oncologists seeking to better tailor their treatments. This, combined with
adoption of some of the clinical interventions suggested in this review, can help
better manage the geriatric oncology patient. Further research is necessary for
the development of more specific evidence-based recommendations.

Survival differences among older dialysis patients in the southeast.

GA.

Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic dialysis have
higher mortality in the United States than in many other countries. While
increasing age, white race, male sex, and/or diabetes are considered risk factors
for survival, few studies of older dialysis patients have simultaneously
considered multiple predictor variables and their interactions. Using information
contained in the 1982 to 1986 ESRD Network 20 database for Georgia and South
Carolina, we studied hospitalizations and survival of 1,354 blacks and 965 whites
who were age 60 years or older when they began dialysis therapy. Survival time
was modeled using the Cox life-table regression method. Older blacks' median age 
at dialysis initiation was 67.4, compared with 68.7 for older whites (P = 0.001).
Blacks were more likely than whites (P < 0.001) to have hypertension-related or
diabetes-related ESRD. White patients experienced approximately 25% more
hospitalization when adjustment was made for patient-days at risk. Separate
multivariate survival models were required for patients with diabetes-related
versus non-diabetes-related ESRD. Among diabetics, mortality was higher among
whites and among patients who were older when they began dialysis. Among patients
with non-diabetes-related ESRD, mortality was higher among patients who were
older when they began dialysis, but the age effect was much stronger for white
males. Our hospitalization and mortality data support the view that unmeasured
severity (or frailty) differences characterize white as compared with black
dialysis patients. Among non-diabetes-related ESRD patients, the age effect on
survival was more severe in white males than in blacks or in white females. The
high mortality we observed among older dialysis patients in Georgia and South
Carolina warrants further study; the data may in part reflect patients' lower
socioeconomic status compared with age, race, and sex-matched controls.
