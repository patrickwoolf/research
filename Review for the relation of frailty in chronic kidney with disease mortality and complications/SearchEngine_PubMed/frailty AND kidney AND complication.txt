Currently, there are no tools to predict postsurgery outcome after kidney
transplantation. This study assesses whether frailty influence 30-day
postoperative complications after kidney transplantation. One-hundred and fifty
kidney transplantations were prospectively included. Frailty was assessed using a
frailty indicator, consisting of 15 questions, covering most domains of
functioning. Postoperative complications were measured by the Comprehensive
Complication Index (CCI). Using a linear regression model, 30-day postoperative
complications and frailty correlation were adjusted for confounders, including
sex, age, ASA Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, BMI, smoking,
dialysis, duration of dialysis, type of transplantation, and retransplantation.
The mean frailty score was 2.07(±1.6) and 23 patients were classified as frail
(GFI ≥4). The mean CCI-score was 18(±15.6), the mean CCI-score for "frail"
patients 30.1(±17.2) compared to 15.5 (±14.2) for "non-frail" patients (N = 116).
In a regression analysis, a significant relationship between CCI-score and
frailty (β = 13.3; 95% CI 5.7-20.9; P = 0.0007) and transplantation type (β =
4.9; 95% CI: 0.72-9.16; P = 0.02) was found, independent of confounders. In
conclusion, frailty and type of transplantation are independent factors
associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications.

BACKGROUND: Symptomatic aortic stenosis has a poor prognosis. Many patients are
considered inoperable or at high surgical risk for surgical aortic valve
replacement (SAVR), reflecting their age, comorbidities and frailty. The clinical
effectiveness and safety of TAVI have not been reviewed systematically for these 
high levels of surgical risk. This systematic review compares mortality and other
important clinical outcomes up to 5 years post treatment following TAVI or other 
treatment in these risk groups.
METHODS: A systematic review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database
(CRD42016048396). The Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination
Databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ZETOC were searched from January 2002 to August
2016. Clinical trials or matched studies comparing TAVI with other treatments for
AS in patients surgically inoperable or operable at a high risk were included.
Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by two reviewers. Data were
pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The main outcomes were all-cause
mortality, efficacy and major complications.
RESULTS: Three good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included.
Patients' mean age ranged from 83-85 years, around half were female and New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV ranged from 83.8% to 94.2%
with frequent comorbidities. In 358 surgically inoperable patients from one RCT, 
TAVI was superior to medical therapy for all-cause mortality at 1 year (hazard
ratio (HR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.92), 2 years (HR 0.50, 95%
CI 0.39-0.65), 3 years (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41to 0.68) and 5 years (HR 0.50, 95% CI
0.39-0.65), and NYHA class III or IV at 2 years (TAVI 16.8% (16/95), medical
therapy 57.5% (23/40), p<0.001), quality of life and re-hospitalisation. TAVI had
higher risks of major bleeding up to 1 year, of stroke up to 3 years (at one year
11.2% versus 5.5%, p = .06; HR at 2 years 2.79, 95% CI 1.25-6.22; HR at 3 years
2.81; 95% CI 1.26-6.26) and of major vascular complication at 3 years (HR 8.27,
95% CI 2.92-23.44). Using the GRADE tool, this evidence was considered to be of
moderate quality. In a meta-analysis including 1,494 high risk surgically
operable patients from two non-inferiority RCTs TAVI showed no significant
differences from SAVR in all-cause mortality at two years (HR 1.03, 95% CI
0.82-1.29) and up to 5 years (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.83-1.12). There were no
statistically significant differences in major vascular complications and
myocardial infarction at any time point, discrepant results for major bleeding on
variable definitions and no differences in stroke rate at any time point. Using
the GRADE tool, this evidence was considered of low quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic aortic stenosis can be lethal without intervention but
surgical resection is contraindicated for some patients and high risk for others.
We found that all-cause mortality up to 5 years of follow-up did not differ
significantly between TAVI and SAVR in patients surgically operable at a high
risk, but favoured TAVI over medical therapy in patients surgically inoperable.
TAVI is a viable life-extending treatment option in these surgical high risk
groups.

As the cirrhosis progresses, development of complication like ascites, hepatic
encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, kidney dysfunction, and hepatocellular
carcinoma signify increasing risk of short term mortality. Malnutrition and
muscle wasting (sarcopenia) is yet other complications that negatively impact
survival, quality of life, and response to stressors, such as infection and
surgery in patients with cirrhosis. Conventionally, these are not routinely
looked for, because nutritional assessment can be a difficult especially if there
is associated fluid retention and/or obesity. Patients with cirrhosis may have a 
combination of loss of skeletal muscle and gain of adipose tissue, culminating in
the condition of "sarcopenic obesity." Sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients has been 
associated with increased mortality, sepsis complications, hyperammonemia, overt 
hepatic encephalopathy, and increased length of stay after liver transplantation.
Assessment of muscles with cross-sectional imaging studies has become an
attractive index of nutritional status evaluation in cirrhosis, as sarcopenia,
the major component of malnutrition, is primarily responsible for the adverse
clinical consequences seen in patients with liver disease. Cirrhosis is a state
of accelerated starvation, with increased gluconeogenesis that requires amino
acid diversion from other metabolic functions. Protein homeostasis is disturbed
in cirrhosis due to several factors such as hyperammonemia, hormonal, and
cytokine abnormalities, physical inactivity and direct effects of ethanol and its
metabolites. New approaches to manage sarcopenia are being evolved. Branched
chain amino acid supplementation, Myostatin inhibitors, and mitochondrial
protective agents are currently in various stages of evaluation in preclinical
studies to prevent and reverse sarcopenia, in cirrhosis.

Frailty is a common complication in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) under dialysis, which is a strong risk factor for low quality of life,
morbidity, and mortality. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of
frailty in a group of Portuguese ESRD patients, and its association with
socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. We performed a
cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3
[±14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients
as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire.
Social support, data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and
haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory
markers were also evaluated. Our results confirmed that frailty is a highly
prevalent condition in ESRD patients, particularly in female patients. An
association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of
hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a perioperative metastatic spinal
tumor frailty index (MSTFI) that could predict morbidity, mortality, and length
of stay.
METHODS: A large inpatient hospitalization database was searched from 2002 to
2011 to identify 4583 patients with spinal metastasis from breast (21.1%), lung
(34.1%), thyroid (3.8%), renal (19.9%), and prostate (21.1%) cancer who underwent
surgery. A multiple logistic regression model identified 9 independent parameters
that were used to construct the MSTFI: anemia, chronic lung disease,
coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary circulation disorders, renal
failure, malnutrition, emergent/urgent admission, and anterior/combined surgical 
approach. Patients with 0 points were categorized as "not frail," 1 as "mildly
frail," 2 as "moderately frail," and ≥3 as "severely frail."
RESULTS: The overall perioperative complication rate was 19.3% and in-patient
mortality was 3.0%. Compared with patients with no frailty, patients with
moderate frailty (odds ratio [OR] 5.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]
2.44-10.86), and severe frailty (OR 5.74; 95% CI 2.69-12.24) had significantly
increased odds of inpatient mortality (all P < 0.001). Similarly, patients with
mild frailty (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.33-2.66), moderate frailty (OR 3.83; 95% CI
2.71-5.41), and severe frailty (OR 6.97; 95% CI 4.98-9.74) had significantly
increased odds of developing a major in-hospital complication (all P < 0.001).
Length of stay also increased significantly by MSTFI (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In surgically treated patients with spinal metastasis, certain
perioperative parameters may significantly predict the risk of major in-hospital 
complications and mortality.

Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are life-threatening
complications after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only
half of CD20-positive PTLDs respond to rituximab monotherapy, and outcomes remain
poor for patients with relapsed/refractory disease, especially those who do not
qualify for an anthracycline containing regimen due to frailty or comorbidities. 
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) might be an option in this particular setting. We report
a panel of eight patients with rituximab refractory/relapsed CD20-positive PTLDs 
including three ineligible for subsequent CHOP-like chemotherapy who received
(90) Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan as a single agent (n = 7) or combined to chemotherapy
(n = 1). Five out of eight patients were kidney transplant recipients, while 2/8 
had a liver transplant and 1/8 had a heart transplant. Patients received a median
of two previous therapies. Overall response rate was 62.5%. Importantly, all
responders achieved complete response. At a median follow-up of 37 months [5;
84], complete response was ongoing in four patients. Toxicity was predominantly
hematological and easily manageable. No graft rejection was noticed concomitantly
or following RIT administration despite immunosuppression reduction after
diagnosis of PTLDs. This report emphasizes the potential efficiency of salvage
RIT for early rituximab refractory PTLDs without any unexpected toxicity.

Recent publications not only underline the risks of age and disease during
surgery but also help us quantify the risks with greater precision. Importantly, 
patient factors often have a stronger association with postoperative mortality
than surgical factors. Important factors preoperatively are: age, American
Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) physical status, emergency surgery, and plasma
albumin concentration. There is emerging work on quantifying frailty as a further
risk factor for perioperative complication and mortality as well as need for
higher level of care after discharge from hospital. Important postoperative
complications include sepsis and kidney injury. Preventing, detecting and
managing complications and mortality is the greatest challenge facing those
caring for surgical patients, including anaesthetists. Evidence for the long term
effects of perioperative complications adds further importance to minimizing
perioperative complications. Newer approaches in patient care, particularly
co-management during the postoperative phase by different specialities are
emerging. Managing high-risk patients should also be enhanced with greater
surveillance and more rapid and appropriate response; ensuring we do not fail to 
rescue our patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is an emergent health-related problem in older adults. The aim
of this study was to examine the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and the
effect of frailty in elderly patients with cardiometabolic risk factors.
METHODS: One-hundred and one patients 65 years or older responded to an HRQOL
assessment using the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-26
questionnaire. Frailty was assessed using two indices: the Hebrew Rehabilitation 
Center for Aged (HRCA) vulnerability index and the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES)
index. In addition, these patients completed self-rating questionnaires assessing
mental well-being [the 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire
(GHQ-28)] and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale).
RESULTS: Based on the combination of HRCA and VES indices, 24 subjects (23.7%)
met the criteria of frail. Persons > or = 75 years old and those with depressive 
mood or lower creatinine clearance had significantly lower WHOQOL-26 scores than 
their counterparts. Diabetes and macrovascular complications did not associate
with the WHOQOL-26 scores. Compared with non-frail patients, the frail scored
lower on the WHOQOL-26 questionnaire after adjusting for age, kidney dysfunction 
and depressive mood. Frail patients also reported significantly higher the GHQ-28
scores compared with non-frail patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail older adults had a significant lower HRQOL, as well as lower
mental well-being, independent of age, diabetes, macrovascular complication,
kidney dysfunction and depressed mood.
