AIM: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been
diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty,
but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with
frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study
to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic
hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited.
Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered
diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not
(Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the
prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined
the risk factors for frailty.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than 
that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the
association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients
(n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their
interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic
nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic
nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18:

OBJECTIVES: Frailty can cause increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes,
such as falls, fractures, depression and reduced health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition,
HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care
utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 
2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5).
METHODS: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney
disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up
study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale);
depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and
cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools.
Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights >136 kg, and coinciding
comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded.
RESULTS: Frailty occurred in 17% of participants (n=7). Frail participants had
lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more 
depression (p=<0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and
emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p<0.05). No differences in
health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail
participants (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney
disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater
depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

Vitamin D deficiency state is endemic in the Kashmir valley of the Indian
subcontinent. Clinicians frequently treat patients with Vitamin D for diverse
clinical symptoms to improve the general health and to reduce the frailty of
elderly and these doses may at times be inappropriately high. Vitamin D
toxicity-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), often considered rare, can be
life-threatening and associated with substantial morbidity if not identified
promptly. We aimed to describe clinical and biochemical features, risk factors,
and management of AKI patients with Vitamin D toxicity seen at a single tertiary 
care centre in Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India,
between January 2014 and January 2016. Evaluation included detailed clinical
history and biochemical tests including serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine,
intact parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Nineteen patients 
with Vitamin D toxicity-induced AKI could be identified. Clinical manifestations 
included nausea, vomiting, altered sensorium, constipation, pancreatitis, AKI,
acute on chronic kidney disease, and weight loss. Median (range) age was 64
(45-89) years. Median (range) serum 25(OH)D level and median (range) total serum 
calcium level were 99 (190-988) ng/mL and 139 (119-152) mg/dL, respectively.
Overdose of Vitamin D caused by prescription of megadoses of Vitamin D was the
cause of AKI in all cases. Median (range) cumulative Vitamin D dose was 6,000,000
(3,600,000-9,000,000) IU. On three- and six-month follow-up, the creatinine and
estimated glomerular filtration rate normalized and returned to baseline in all
patients except three cases who had underlying chronic kidney disease. Three
patients needed rehospitalization for another episode of AKI. Our data
demonstrate an emergence of Vitamin D toxicity as a cause of AKI in this part of 
the world. Irrational use of Vitamin D in megadoses resulted in AKI in all cases.
Persistence of Vitamin D in the body for longer time resulted in
rehospitalization of patients with AKI. Awareness among health-care providers
regarding the toxic potential of high doses of Vitamin D and cautious use of
Vitamin D supplements can have immense value to prevent this AKI.

AIM: A recent, growing concern regarding haemodialysis in Japan is a sustained
increase in the elderly population. Among very elderly people who start
haemodialysis, the prognosis is considered to be poor; however, this has not been
fully elucidated. This study aimed to discover the short-term prognosis and
related factors in very elderly patients who commence haemodialysis.
METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2013, 122 patients aged ≥85 years at
haemodialysis initiation were documented in our hospital. Predictors of 90-day
and 1-year mortality after haemodialysis initiation were assessed with Cox
proportional hazards regression analysis. Selection of covariates for the
multivariate model was based on forward stepwise selection using the probability 
of a likelihood ratio statistics.
RESULTS: The subjects' mean age was 87.4 ± 2.5 years, and 48% were female. The
most common cause of death was infection (38% of patients) and the leading cause 
of infectious death was pneumonia. The 90-day and 1-year survival rates were 81% 
and 62%, respectively. Suboptimal initiation was a significant prognostic factor 
for 90-day [hazard ratio (HR) 3.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-13.43] and 
1-year [HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.51-6.76] mortality after adjusting for confounders in
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Very elderly patients who started haemodialysis had a poor prognosis,
and suboptimal initiation significantly predicted outcome. Shared decision-making
with patients and their families is needed for initiating haemodialysis on the
conditions that appropriate information on the expected prognosis is provided.

Objective To determine the safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use
compared with warfarin use for the treatment of venous
thromboembolism.Design Retrospective matched cohort study conducted between 1
January 2009 and 31 March 2016.Setting Community based, using healthcare data
from six jurisdictions in Canada and the United States.Participants 59 525 adults
(12 489 DOAC users; 47 036 warfarin users) with a new diagnosis of venous
thromboembolism and a prescription for a DOAC or warfarin within 30 days of
diagnosis.Main outcome measures Outcomes included hospital admission or emergency
department visit for major bleeding and all cause mortality within 90 days after 
starting treatment. Propensity score matching and shared frailty models were used
to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of the outcomes comparing DOACs with warfarin.
Analyses were conducted independently at each site, with meta-analytical methods 
used to estimate pooled hazard ratios across sites.Results Of the 59 525
participants, 1967 (3.3%) had a major bleed and 1029 (1.7%) died over a mean
follow-up of 85.2 days. The risk of major bleeding was similar for DOAC compared 
with warfarin use (pooled hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to
1.03), with the overall direction of the association favouring DOAC use. No
difference was found in the risk of death (pooled hazard ratio 0.99, 0.84 to
1.16) for DOACs compared with warfarin use. There was no evidence of
heterogeneity across centres, between patients with and without chronic kidney
disease, across age groups, or between male and female patients.Conclusions In
this analysis of adults with incident venous thromboembolism, treatment with
DOACs, compared with warfarin, was not associated with an increased risk of major
bleeding or all cause mortality in the first 90 days of treatment.Trial
registration Clinical trials NCT02833987.

Objectives To derive and validate a risk prediction equation to estimate the
short term risk of death, and to develop a classification method for frailty
based on risk of death and risk of unplanned hospital
admission.Design Prospective open cohort study.Participants Routinely collected
data from 1436 general practices contributing data to QResearch in England
between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used to develop the scores and a
separate set of 357 practices to validate the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 
65-100 years were in the derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the
validation cohort.Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation
cohort were used to derive separate risk equations in men and women for
evaluation of the risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age,
sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index,
medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent
investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the
validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group.
The new mortality equation was used in conjunction with the existing QAdmissions 
equation (which predicts risk of unplanned hospital admission) to classify
patients into frailty groups.Main outcome measure The primary outcome was all
cause mortality.Results During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the
derivation cohort arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The
final model included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic
group, smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the past 
12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive heart failure,
corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, learning disability,
leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, poor
mobility, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2
diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result,
high platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite loss,
unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good calibration and
high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the equation
explained 55.6% of the variation in time to death (R2), and had very good
discrimination-the D statistic was 2.29, and Harrell's C statistic value was
0.85. The corresponding values for men were 53.1%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining
predicted risks of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7% of patients 
(n=13 665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4% (n=46 770) as moderately
frail, 43.1% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8% (n=223 790) as
fit.Conclusions We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of
death in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social,
and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate
validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction with the
QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty groups (known as
QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be identified for further assessment
or interventions.

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its
impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
is less defined.
METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 
trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three
groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR
≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were
analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors
of 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the
PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767
(30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 
(12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted
Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with
severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher
prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of
death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate
and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% 
in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild
RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus
none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other
significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass
index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction,
oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male
sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement
can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light
chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies
have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We
evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in
France.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered
in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 
with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored
for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as
renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and 
causes of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334
(23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72
years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was
observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation
was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis,
67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were 
malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and
cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty 
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high
BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is
poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of
death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the
elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in
comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly
individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength,
body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and
endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined
outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were
assessed.
METHODS: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient
drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12
months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc
Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail
and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition
(DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years 
old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After 
some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30
to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; 
IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 
14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 
2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the 
casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that
frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney
disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either
worse endothelial function or mortality.

BACKGROUND: Dental disease is more extensive in adults with chronic kidney
disease, but whether dental health and behaviors are associated with survival in 
the setting of hemodialysis is unknown.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multinational cohort.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,205 adults treated with long-term hemodialysis, 2010 to
2012 (Oral Diseases in Hemodialysis [ORAL-D] Study).
PREDICTORS: Dental health as assessed by a standardized dental examination using 
World Health Organization guidelines and personal oral care, including
edentulousness; decayed, missing, and filled teeth index; teeth brushing and
flossing; and dental health consultation.
OUTCOMES: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months after dental
assessment.
MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models
fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within
countries.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 22.1 months, 942 deaths occurred, including
477 cardiovascular deaths. Edentulousness (adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.51) 
and decayed, missing, or filled teeth score ≥ 14 (adjusted HR, 1.70; 95% CI,
1.33-2.17) were associated with early all-cause mortality, while dental flossing,
using mouthwash, brushing teeth daily, spending at least 2 minutes on oral
hygiene daily, changing a toothbrush at least every 3 months, and visiting a
dentist within the past 6 months (adjusted HRs of 0.52 [95% CI, 0.32-0.85], 0.79 
[95% CI, 0.64-0.97], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58-0.99], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-0.99], 0.79
[95% CI, 0.65-0.95], and 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.96], respectively) were associated 
with better survival. Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar.
LIMITATIONS: Convenience sample of clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: In adults treated with hemodialysis, poorer dental health was
associated with early death, whereas preventive dental health practices were
associated with longer survival.

Center, Baltimore VA Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in 
individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on 
their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of
cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that
highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid
conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating
cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including
microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally,
studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected
in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with
worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk
of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible
short-term effects on markers of physical performance.
SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to 
better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of
physical functioning and encouragement of physical activity in management of the 
patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), implementation has been undermined by 
a lack of understanding of the evidence for this recommendation. The purpose of
this review is to present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic
cohorts that report associations between low levels of physical functioning
and/or low physical activity and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Low levels of physical activity and poor physical functioning
are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical outcomes in adult
patients with CKD, regardless of treatment modality. Low physical performance and
activity limitations are more prevalent in patients with CKD, regardless of age, 
compared to older community-dwelling adults.
SUMMARY: The strength of the evidence presented should strongly motivate a focus 
of treatment on assessing and improving physical activity and physical function
as part of routine patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical
activity interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of
age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that is
similar to or higher than the general population of elderly adults; physical
activity, physical function, and performance are strongly associated with
all-cause mortality; and exercise training and exercise counseling have been
shown to improve measures of physical functioning.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced
functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing
the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the
CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or
evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based
cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study.
OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association
with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more
of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss,
exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum
cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to
relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was
51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much
older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components
were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes,
eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a
2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of
frailty compared with GFR(cys) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during 
a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was
associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or 
dialysis therapy.
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal
relationships between CKD and frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is
associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.

Thyroid hormone abnormalities and frailty in elderly patients with chronic kidney
disease: a hypothesis.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults,
affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are
encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap
with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder 
may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded
in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed 
to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is
being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization
and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low
testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of
whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly
CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In
this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone
abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with
CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors 
predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and
treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
importance.

Health-related quality of life outcomes in chronic kidney disease.

Pennsylvania 15213, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

This study investigated mortality in 568 individuals from the Goessel Mennonite
community in rural central Kansas. There were three main objectives to this
research: 1) characterize mortality trends within a biologically well-defined
Mennonite community; 2) determine what biochemical, morphological, and
physiological risk factors could be related to all-cause mortality, stratified by
age and sex; and 3) compare these results to previously described variables that 
were associated with both biological age and mortality in this population.
Mortality data were obtained from three sources: Kansas Vital Records, the Social
Security death index, and church records. In total, 221 (39%) individuals were
found to have died in this population between January 1980-June 2002. Analogous
to the larger US population, the three leading causes of death in this community 
were heart disease, cancer, and stroke, accounting for 60% of all deaths. Besides
advancing age, the greatest biological risk factor in this population was
decreased amounts of albumin in men (relative risk, 2.47), potentially indicating
underreported cases of either chronic kidney disease or frailty syndrome for
males. Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated that increased amounts of
total cholesterol may provide a protective effect for elderly individuals. We
conclude, based on the previously described heritability of both albumin (h(2) = 
0.40) and total cholesterol (h(2) = 0.50) in this population, that underlying
genetic factors associated with both chronic degenerative diseases and biological
aging may have important implications for understanding mortality patterns in
this community.
