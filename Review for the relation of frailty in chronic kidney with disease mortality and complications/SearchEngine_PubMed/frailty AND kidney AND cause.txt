BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fluid overload and intradialytic hypotension are
associated with cardiovascular events and mortality in patients on hemodialysis. 
We investigated associations between hemodialysis facility practices related to
fluid volume and intradialytic hypotension and patient outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Data were analyzed from 10,250
patients in 273 facilities across 12 countries, from phase 4 of the Dialysis
Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS; 2009-2012). Cox regression models
(shared frailty) were used to estimate associations between facility practices
reported by medical directors in response to the DOPPS Medical Directors Survey
and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization, and
cardiovascular events, adjusting for country, age, sex, dialysis vintage,
predialysis systolic BP, cardiovascular comorbidities, diabetes, body mass index,
smoking, residual kidney function, dialysis adequacy, and vascular access type.
RESULTS: Of ten facility practices tested (chosen a priori), having a protocol
that specifies how often to assess dry weight in most patients was associated
with lower all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 99% confidence interval [99% CI], 
0.64 to 0.94) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.72; 99% CI, 0.55 to 0.95).
Routine orthostatic BP measurement to assess dry weight was associated with lower
all-cause hospitalization (HR, 0.86; 99% CI, 0.77 to 0.97) and cardiovascular
events (HR, 0.85; 99% CI, 0.73 to 0.98). Routine use of lower dialysate
temperature to limit or prevent intradialytic hypotension was associated with
lower cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.76; 99% CI, 0.58 to 0.98). Routine use of
an online volume indicator to assess dry weight was associated with higher
all-cause hospitalization (HR, 1.19; 99% CI, 1.02 to 1.38). Routine use of sodium
modeling/profiling to limit or prevent intradialytic hypotension was associated
with higher all-cause mortality (HR, 1.36; 99% CI, 1.14 to 1.63), cardiovascular 
mortality (HR, 1.34; 99% CI, 1.04 to 1.73), and cardiovascular events (HR, 1.21; 
99% CI, 1.03 to 1.43).
CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis facility practices relating to the management of fluid 
volume and intradialytic hypotension are associated with patient outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been presented regarding influence of body
mass index (BMI) on outcomes among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve
implantation (TAVI).
AIMS: To investigate impact of the BMI on the clinical results after TAVI.
METHODS: A total of 148 consecutive patients were categorized using baseline BMI 
according to World Health Organization criteria. The baseline patient
characteristics, frailty, procedural and clinical outcomes with 30 days and
12-month all-cause mortality were compared between BMI categories. Patients were 
followed-up for a median of 460.0 (182.0-1042.0) days.
RESULTS: Obesity was diagnosed in 37 (25.2%) patients, 73 were overweight
(49.7%), and 37 (25.2%) had normal weight. Lower frailty prevalence as assessed
with 5-meter walking test was confirmed in obese patients as compared to other
groups. A trend towards a lower rate of in-hospital bleeding complications [18
(48.6%) vs. 21 (28.8%) vs. 9 (24.3%); p = 0.06] and less frequent blood
transfusions in overweight and obese was observed [18 (48.6%) vs. 17 [23.3%) vs. 
8 (21.6%); p = 0.016]. The rate of grade 3 acute kidney injury was the lowest in 
the overweight group [4 (10.8%) vs. 1 (1.4%) vs. 3 (8.1%); p = 0.05]. There was
no difference between groups in all-cause mortality at 30 days (p = 0.15).
However, 12-month all-cause mortality was the lowest in obese patients [12
(32.4%) vs. 10 (13.7%) vs. 2 (5.4%); p = 0.004]. Increase in BMI was
independently associated with lower all-cause mortality [HR (95%CI) per 1 kg/m²
increase: 0.91 (0.845-0.98); p = 0.018].
CONCLUSIONS: Increased BMI was independently associated with survival benefit
after TAVI.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 2% to 4% of patients with
severe aortic stenosis. It is because these patients have been excluded from
clinical trials, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in 
this patient group has not been thoroughly investigated. Between April 2008 and
March 2015, 2,000 patients (dialysis group, n = 56 [2.8%]) were consecutively
enrolled when diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and eligible to undergo TAVI.
Procedural and longer-term outcomes were analyzed and adjusted for differences in
baseline characteristics. Patients on dialysis had a higher periprocedural
mortality (10.7% vs 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 5.65, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.91 to 16.67; p = 0.002) and a lower Valve Academic Research
Consortium (VARC)-II (VARC) defined device success (adjOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to
0.79; p = 0.012). At 30 days, there was an increased rate of all-cause mortality 
(21.4 vs 4.8%; adjOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.96 to 12.26; p = 0.001), cardiovascular
(adjOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.41; p = 0.007) and noncardiovascular mortality
(adjOR 6.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 9.41; p = 0.019), myocardial infarction (adjOR 9.39, 
95% CI 1.84 to 48.03; p = 0.007), bleeding (adjOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.83;
p = 0.036) as well as the VARC-II defined early safety combined end point (adjOR 
2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.90; p = 0.012) associated with dialysis. Dialysis was
associated with poor survival at one (57.1% vs 84.2%) and 3 years (26.8% vs
66.9%) with or without the consideration of the first 72 hours (p <0.001;
adjusted p <0.001). Although, in the multivariable regression analysis, reduced
ejection fraction, peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH),
frailty and dialysis were associated with 1-year mortality, only PH (>60 mm Hg)
remained significant in an analysis restricted to the dialysis patients (adjusted
hazard ratio 2.68; 95% CI 1.18 to 5.88; p = 0.018). PH had a sensitivity of
45.8%, a specificity of 81.3%, and a positive predictive value of 64.7%. In
conclusion, dialysis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who
underwent TAVI. Long-term mortality in dialysis patients appears to be largely
determined by the kidney disease and/or dialysis itself whereas VARC-II defined
complications are largely unaffected. An increased short-term mortality still
calls for (pre-) procedural optimization.

AIM: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been
diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty,
but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with
frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study
to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic
hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited.
Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered
diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not
(Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the
prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined
the risk factors for frailty.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than 
that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the
association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients
(n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their
interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic
nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic
nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18:
1597-1602.

OBJECTIVES: Frailty can cause increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes,
such as falls, fractures, depression and reduced health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition,
HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care
utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 
2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5).
METHODS: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney
disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up
study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale);
depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and
cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools.
Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights >136 kg, and coinciding
comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded.
RESULTS: Frailty occurred in 17% of participants (n=7). Frail participants had
lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more 
depression (p=<0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and
emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p<0.05). No differences in
health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail
participants (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney
disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater
depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.

The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in the 1990s has
dramatically changed the course of HIV infection, decreasing the risk for both
AIDS- and non-AIDS-related events. Cancers, cardiovascular disease (CVD), liver
and kidney disease, neurological disorders and frailty have become of great
importance lately in the clinical management as they represent the principal
cause of death in people living with HIV who receive cART (Kirk et al. in Clin
Infect Dis 45(1):103-10, 2007; Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral
Therapy Study et al. N Engl J Med 355(22):2283-2296, 2006; Ances et al. J Infect 
Dis 201(3):336-340, 2010; Desquilbet et al. J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci
62(11):1279-1286, 2007; Lifson et al. HIV Clin Trials 9(3):177-185, 2008).
Despite the undeniable achievements of cART, we are now faced with its
limitations: a considerable proportion of individuals, referred as to
immunological non-responders, fails to reconstitute the immune system despite
optimal treatment and viral suppression (Kelley et al. Clin Infect Dis
48(6):787-794, 2009; Robbins et al. Clin Infect Dis 48(3):350-361, 2009) and
remains at high risk for opportunistic infections and non-AIDS-related events
(Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy Study et al. N Engl J Med
355(22):2283-2296, 2006). Moreover, the generalized state of immune activation
and inflammation, linked to serious non-AIDS events, persists despite successful 
HIV suppression with cART. Finally, the current strategies have so far failed to 
eradicate the virus, and inflammation appears a driving force in viral
persistence. In the light of all this, it is of fundamental importance to
investigate the pathophysiological processes that link incomplete immune
recovery, immune activation and HIV persistence to design targeted therapies that
could impact on the three.

Background: Hospitalizations of chronic dialysis patients have not been
previously studied at a national level in Canada. Understanding the scope and
variables associated with hospitalizations will inform measures for improvement.
Objective: To describe the risk of all-cause and infection-related
hospitalizations in patients on dialysis.
Design: Retrospective cohort study using health care administrative databases.
Setting: Provinces and territories across Canada (excluding Manitoba and Quebec).
Patients: Incident chronic dialysis patients with a dialysis start date between
January 1, 2005, and March 31, 2014. Patients with a prior history of kidney
transplantation were excluded.
Measurements: Patient characteristics were recorded at baseline. Dialysis
modality was treated as a time-varying covariate. The primary outcomes of
interest were all-cause and dialysis-specific infection-related hospitalizations.
Methods: Crude rates for all-cause hospitalization and infection-related
hospitalization were determined per patient year (PPY) at 7 and 30 days, and at
3, 6, and 12 months postdialysis initiation. A stratified, gamma-distributed
frailty model was used to assess repeat hospital admissions and to determine the 
inter-recurrence dependence of hospitalizations within individuals, as well as
the hazard ratio (HR) attributed to each covariate of interest.
Results: A total of 38 369 incident chronic dialysis patients were included: 38
088 adults and 281 pediatric patients (age less than 18 years). There were 112
374 hospitalizations, of which 11.5% were infection-related hospitalizations. The
all-cause hospitalization rate was similar for all adult age groups (age 65 years
and older: 1.40, 1.35, and 1.18 admissions PPY at 7 days, 30 days, and 6 months, 
respectively). The all-cause hospitalization rate was higher for pediatric
patients (1.67, 2.48, and 2.47 admissions PPY at 7 days, 30 days, and 6 months,
respectively; adjusted HR: 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.37-3.15,
referent age group: 45-64 years). Within the first 7 days after dialysis
initiation, patients on peritoneal dialysis had a higher risk of all-cause
hospitalization (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.07-1.50) and infection-related
hospitalization (HR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.19-3.55) compared with patients on
hemodialysis. Beyond 7 days, the risk did not differ significantly by dialysis
modality. Female sex and Indigenous race were significant risk factors for
all-cause hospitalization.
Limitations: The cohort had too few home hemodialysis patients to examine this
subgroup. The outcome of infection-related hospitalization was determined using
diagnostic codes. Dialysis patients from Manitoba and Quebec were not included.
Conclusions: In Canada, the rates of hospitalization were not influenced by
dialysis modality beyond the initial 7-day period following dialysis initiation; 
however, the rate of hospitalization in pediatric patients was higher than in
adults at every time frame examined.

Publisher: Le taux d’hospitalisation des patients dialysés n’avait jamais fait
l’objet d’une étude pancanadienne. Une connaissance approfondie de la portée et
des variables associées aux hospitalisations orientera les mesures
d’amélioration.L’étude visait à mieux évaluer les risques d’hospitalisations des 
patients dialysés; toutes causes confondues ou liées spécifiquement à une
infection.Il s’agit d’une étude de cohorte rétrospective fondée sur des bases de 
données administratives en santé.L’étude couvrait les provinces et territoires du
Canada à l’exception du Québec et du Manitoba.L’étude a porté sur tous les
patients dialysés à vie dont le traitement avait commencé entre le 1er janvier
2005 et le 31 mars 2014. Les patients ayant reçu une greffe rénale ont été
exclus.Les caractéristiques initiales des patients ont été consignées, et la
modalité de dialyse a été traitée comme une co-variable sujette à changement dans
le temps. La principale issue d’intérêt était une hospitalisation due à une
infection directement liée à la dialyse, ou une hospitalisation toutes causes
confondues.Les taux bruts d’hospitalisations toutes causes confondues (global) et
d’hospitalisations liées à une infection ont été calculés en années-patients
(HAP) à différents moments suivant le début de la dialyse (7 jours, 30 jours, 3
mois, 6 mois et 12 mois). Un modèle stratifié de fragilité à distribution gamma a
été employé pour i) répertorier les hospitalisations répétées; ii) déterminer
l’interrécurrence et le lien de dépendance entre les hospitalisations pour chaque
patient; et iii) établir le rapport de risque (RR) attribué à chaque covariable
d’intérêt.En tout, 38 369 patients dialysés, soit 38 088 adultes et 281 patients 
mineurs (moins de 18 ans) ont été inclus dans l’étude. Au cours de la période
étudiée, on a répertorié 112 374 hospitalisations, dont 11,5 % étaient dues à une
infection en lien direct avec la dialyse. Le taux d’hospitalisations global était
similaire pour tous les groupes d’âge chez les patients adultes. Par exemple,
chez les patients âgés de 65 ans et plus, ce taux se situait respectivement à
1,40 HAP, à 1,35 HAP et à 1,18 HAP lorsque calculé 7 jours, 30 jours et 6 mois
après l’initiation de la dialyse. Lorsque comparé au groupe des 45-64 ans, le
taux d’hospitalisations global s’est avéré plus élevé chez les patients
pédiatriques (1,67 HAP à 7 jours, 2,48 HAP à 30 jours et 2,47 HAP à 6 mois)
post-initiation de la dialyse (RR: 2,73; IC 95 %: 2,37-3,15). Dans les 7 jours
suivant l’initiation du traitement, les patients traités par dialyse péritonéale 
présentaient un risque plus élevé d’hospitalisation toutes causes confondues (RR:
1,27; IC 95 %: 1,07-1,50) ou d’hospitalisation liée à une infection (RR: 2,05; IC
95 %: 1,19-3,55) que les patients hémodialysés. Par contre, cet écart entre les
modalités de dialyse n’était plus observable au-delà des sept premiers jours.
Enfin, le fait d’être autochtone ou de sexe féminin s’avérait un facteur de
risque d’hospitalisation significatif (toutes causes confondues).Plusieurs
facteurs limitent la portée des résultats: i) la cohorte comptait trop peu de
patients hémodialysés à domicile pour permettre une analyse de ce sous-groupe;
ii) les hospitalisations relatives à une infection ont été établies à l’aide de
codes diagnostiques; et iii) les patients dialysés résidant au Québec et au

BACKGROUND: Symptomatic aortic stenosis has a poor prognosis. Many patients are
considered inoperable or at high surgical risk for surgical aortic valve
replacement (SAVR), reflecting their age, comorbidities and frailty. The clinical
effectiveness and safety of TAVI have not been reviewed systematically for these 
high levels of surgical risk. This systematic review compares mortality and other
important clinical outcomes up to 5 years post treatment following TAVI or other 
treatment in these risk groups.
METHODS: A systematic review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database
(CRD42016048396). The Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination
Databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ZETOC were searched from January 2002 to August
2016. Clinical trials or matched studies comparing TAVI with other treatments for
AS in patients surgically inoperable or operable at a high risk were included.
Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by two reviewers. Data were
pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The main outcomes were all-cause
mortality, efficacy and major complications.
RESULTS: Three good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included.
Patients' mean age ranged from 83-85 years, around half were female and New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV ranged from 83.8% to 94.2%
with frequent comorbidities. In 358 surgically inoperable patients from one RCT, 
TAVI was superior to medical therapy for all-cause mortality at 1 year (hazard
ratio (HR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.92), 2 years (HR 0.50, 95%
CI 0.39-0.65), 3 years (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41to 0.68) and 5 years (HR 0.50, 95% CI
0.39-0.65), and NYHA class III or IV at 2 years (TAVI 16.8% (16/95), medical
therapy 57.5% (23/40), p<0.001), quality of life and re-hospitalisation. TAVI had
higher risks of major bleeding up to 1 year, of stroke up to 3 years (at one year
11.2% versus 5.5%, p = .06; HR at 2 years 2.79, 95% CI 1.25-6.22; HR at 3 years
2.81; 95% CI 1.26-6.26) and of major vascular complication at 3 years (HR 8.27,
95% CI 2.92-23.44). Using the GRADE tool, this evidence was considered to be of
moderate quality. In a meta-analysis including 1,494 high risk surgically
operable patients from two non-inferiority RCTs TAVI showed no significant
differences from SAVR in all-cause mortality at two years (HR 1.03, 95% CI
0.82-1.29) and up to 5 years (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.83-1.12). There were no
statistically significant differences in major vascular complications and
myocardial infarction at any time point, discrepant results for major bleeding on
variable definitions and no differences in stroke rate at any time point. Using
the GRADE tool, this evidence was considered of low quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic aortic stenosis can be lethal without intervention but
surgical resection is contraindicated for some patients and high risk for others.
We found that all-cause mortality up to 5 years of follow-up did not differ
significantly between TAVI and SAVR in patients surgically operable at a high
risk, but favoured TAVI over medical therapy in patients surgically inoperable.
TAVI is a viable life-extending treatment option in these surgical high risk
groups.

Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after
transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for
nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period
are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa …), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or
Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical
antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and
bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation,
pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H.
influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take
advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to 
six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many
years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial
pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of
pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in
diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney
transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with
co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome,
increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common
opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant
recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and 
Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of
immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective
therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy
should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an increasingly
common treatment of symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis (AS). Thus, it is
reasonable to carefully investigate the impact of individual clinical factors on 
outcomes after TAVI.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the impact of the previous cerebro-vascular
events (CVEs) on outcomes of patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: A total of 148 consecutive patients scheduled for TAVI were included and
stratified as with and without a history of CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic
attack). Frailty features were also assessed. The primary endpoint was a 12-month
all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Seventeen (11.5%) patients had a history of CVEs (the CVE group). At 30 
days and 12 months, all-cause mortality was higher in the CVE group [30-day: 5
(29.4%) vs. 7 (5.3%); p=0.005; 12-month: 9 (52.9%) vs. 13 (9.9%); p=0.001].
Similarly, at the longest available follow-up, mortality was higher in the CVE
group [10 (58.8%) vs. 23 (17.6%); p=0.001]. Similar rates of other complications 
after TAVI were noted, apart from inhospital acute kidney injury (AKI) grade 3 [3
(17.6%) vs. 5 (3.8%); p=0.049] and blood transfusions [9 (52.9%) vs. 35 (26.7%); 
p=0.026]. Results of 5MWT and Katz index assessment indicated a greater level of 
frailty in the CVE group. There were no differences in subsequent events
including CVEs, bleeding, myocardial infarction, and new-onset of atrial
fibrillation (AF) at 12 months between the groups.
CONCLUSION: We showed that a history of CVEs in patients with severe AS
undergoing TAVI is associated with a higher long-term mortality.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

Vitamin D deficiency state is endemic in the Kashmir valley of the Indian
subcontinent. Clinicians frequently treat patients with Vitamin D for diverse
clinical symptoms to improve the general health and to reduce the frailty of
elderly and these doses may at times be inappropriately high. Vitamin D
toxicity-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), often considered rare, can be
life-threatening and associated with substantial morbidity if not identified
promptly. We aimed to describe clinical and biochemical features, risk factors,
and management of AKI patients with Vitamin D toxicity seen at a single tertiary 
care centre in Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India,
between January 2014 and January 2016. Evaluation included detailed clinical
history and biochemical tests including serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine,
intact parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Nineteen patients 
with Vitamin D toxicity-induced AKI could be identified. Clinical manifestations 
included nausea, vomiting, altered sensorium, constipation, pancreatitis, AKI,
acute on chronic kidney disease, and weight loss. Median (range) age was 64
(45-89) years. Median (range) serum 25(OH)D level and median (range) total serum 
calcium level were 99 (190-988) ng/mL and 139 (119-152) mg/dL, respectively.
Overdose of Vitamin D caused by prescription of megadoses of Vitamin D was the
cause of AKI in all cases. Median (range) cumulative Vitamin D dose was 6,000,000
(3,600,000-9,000,000) IU. On three- and six-month follow-up, the creatinine and
estimated glomerular filtration rate normalized and returned to baseline in all
patients except three cases who had underlying chronic kidney disease. Three
patients needed rehospitalization for another episode of AKI. Our data
demonstrate an emergence of Vitamin D toxicity as a cause of AKI in this part of 
the world. Irrational use of Vitamin D in megadoses resulted in AKI in all cases.
Persistence of Vitamin D in the body for longer time resulted in
rehospitalization of patients with AKI. Awareness among health-care providers
regarding the toxic potential of high doses of Vitamin D and cautious use of
Vitamin D supplements can have immense value to prevent this AKI.

BACKGROUND: Physical frailty and loss of mobility in elderly individuals lead to 
reduced independence, quality of life, and increased mortality. Vitamin B12
deficiency has been linked to several age-related chronic diseases, including in 
the musculo-skeletal system, where vitamin B12 deficiency is generally believed
to be linked to poor nutritional intake. In the present study, we asked whether
aging and frailty associate with altered vitamin B12 homeostasis in humans and
investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms using preclinical models.
METHODS: We analysed a subset of the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study and
stratified 238 participants based on age and Fried frailty criteria. Levels of
methyl-malonic acid (MMA), a marker for vitamin B12 deficiency, and amnionless,
the vitamin B12 co-receptor that anchors the vitamin B12 transport complex to the
membrane of epithelial cells, were measured in plasma. In addition, vitamin B12
levels and the molecular mechanisms of vitamin B12 uptake and excretion were
analysed in ileum, kidney, liver, and blood using a rat model of natural aging
where nutritional intake is fully controlled.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that aging and frailty are associated with a higher
prevalence of functional vitamin B12 deficiency that can be detected by increased
levels of MMA in blood (ρ = 0.25; P = 0.00013). The decline in circulating
vitamin B12 levels is recapitulated in a rat model of natural aging where food
composition and intake are stable. At the molecular level, these perturbations
involve altered expression of amnionless in the ileum and kidney. Interestingly, 
we demonstrate that amnionless can be detected in serum where its levels increase
during aging in both rodents and human (P = 3.3e-07 and 9.2e-07, respectively).
Blood amnionless levels negatively correlate with vitamin B12 in rats (r2
 = 0.305; P = 0.0042) and positively correlate with the vitamin B12 deficiency
marker MMA in humans (ρ = 0.22; P = 0.00068).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that aging and frailty cause intrinsic
vitamin B12 deficiencies, which can occur independently of nutritional intake.
Mechanistically, vitamin B12 deficiency involves the physio-pathological decline 
of both the intestinal uptake and the renal reabsorption system for vitamin B12. 
Finally, amnionless is a novel biomarker which can detect perturbed vitamin B12
bioavailability during aging and physical frailty.

AIM: A recent, growing concern regarding haemodialysis in Japan is a sustained
increase in the elderly population. Among very elderly people who start
haemodialysis, the prognosis is considered to be poor; however, this has not been
fully elucidated. This study aimed to discover the short-term prognosis and
related factors in very elderly patients who commence haemodialysis.
METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2013, 122 patients aged ≥85 years at
haemodialysis initiation were documented in our hospital. Predictors of 90-day
and 1-year mortality after haemodialysis initiation were assessed with Cox
proportional hazards regression analysis. Selection of covariates for the
multivariate model was based on forward stepwise selection using the probability 
of a likelihood ratio statistics.
RESULTS: The subjects' mean age was 87.4 ± 2.5 years, and 48% were female. The
most common cause of death was infection (38% of patients) and the leading cause 
of infectious death was pneumonia. The 90-day and 1-year survival rates were 81% 
and 62%, respectively. Suboptimal initiation was a significant prognostic factor 
for 90-day [hazard ratio (HR) 3.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-13.43] and 
1-year [HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.51-6.76] mortality after adjusting for confounders in
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Very elderly patients who started haemodialysis had a poor prognosis,
and suboptimal initiation significantly predicted outcome. Shared decision-making
with patients and their families is needed for initiating haemodialysis on the
conditions that appropriate information on the expected prognosis is provided.

BACKGROUND: Although individuals classified as nonresident aliens, including
undocumented immigrants, are entitled to receive emergency dialysis in the United
States regardless of their ability to pay, most states do not provide them with
subsidized care for maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation. We explored
whether nonresident aliens have similar outcomes to US citizens after receiving
kidney transplants covered by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health
insurance program.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adult Medicaid patients in the US Renal Data System
who received their first kidney transplant from 1990 to 2011.
PREDICTOR: Citizenship status, categorized as US citizen, nonresident alien, or
permanent resident.
OUTCOME: All-cause transplant loss.
MEASUREMENTS: HRs and 95% CIs estimated by applying Cox proportional hazards
frailty models with transplantation center as a random effect.
RESULTS: Of 10,495 patients, 8,660 (82%) were US citizens, 1,489 (14%) were
permanent residents, and 346 (3%) were nonresident aliens, whom we assumed were
undocumented immigrants. Nonresident aliens were younger, healthier, receiving
dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a living donor. 71% underwent
transplantation in California, and 61% underwent transplantation after 2005.
Nonresident aliens had a lower unadjusted risk for transplant loss compared with 
US citizens (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still
significant when adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, dialysis, and
transplant-related factors (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94).
LIMITATIONS: Citizenship status was self-reported, possible residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the select group of insured nonresident
aliens who undergo transplantation with Medicaid do just as well as US citizens
with Medicaid. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for kidney
transplantation in nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, given
the associated high-quality outcomes in these patients.

Objective To determine the safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use
compared with warfarin use for the treatment of venous
thromboembolism.Design Retrospective matched cohort study conducted between 1
January 2009 and 31 March 2016.Setting Community based, using healthcare data
from six jurisdictions in Canada and the United States.Participants 59 525 adults
(12 489 DOAC users; 47 036 warfarin users) with a new diagnosis of venous
thromboembolism and a prescription for a DOAC or warfarin within 30 days of
diagnosis.Main outcome measures Outcomes included hospital admission or emergency
department visit for major bleeding and all cause mortality within 90 days after 
starting treatment. Propensity score matching and shared frailty models were used
to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of the outcomes comparing DOACs with warfarin.
Analyses were conducted independently at each site, with meta-analytical methods 
used to estimate pooled hazard ratios across sites.Results Of the 59 525
participants, 1967 (3.3%) had a major bleed and 1029 (1.7%) died over a mean
follow-up of 85.2 days. The risk of major bleeding was similar for DOAC compared 
with warfarin use (pooled hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to
1.03), with the overall direction of the association favouring DOAC use. No
difference was found in the risk of death (pooled hazard ratio 0.99, 0.84 to
1.16) for DOACs compared with warfarin use. There was no evidence of
heterogeneity across centres, between patients with and without chronic kidney
disease, across age groups, or between male and female patients.Conclusions In
this analysis of adults with incident venous thromboembolism, treatment with
DOACs, compared with warfarin, was not associated with an increased risk of major
bleeding or all cause mortality in the first 90 days of treatment.Trial
registration Clinical trials NCT02833987.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of physical 
activity on various aspects in Asian dialysis patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Study participants were recruited
from 27 hospitals or dialysis centers in Korea (n = 1611). The participants were 
divided into 3 groups according to the degree of regular exercise: Inactive
group, Intermediate group, and Active group.
RESULTS: The proportions of patients with frailty and the presence of each
component decreased as physical activity increased. The presence and numbers of
disabilities decreased as physical activity increased. The number of participants
with a history of fall during the last 12 months was 149 (20.5%) in the Inactive 
group, 88 (16.9%) in the Intermediate group, and 48 (13.2%) in the Active group. 
Physical component scale and mental component scale scores increased as physical 
activity increased. The survival rate for all-cause death at 500 days was 95.5%
in the Active group, 95.2% in the Intermediate group, and 93.5% in the Inactive
group.
CONCLUSION: High physical activity was associated with favorable results for most
health-related quality of life scale scores, including frailty, disability, and
exhaustion, in Korean dialysis patients.

Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

Objectives To derive and validate a risk prediction equation to estimate the
short term risk of death, and to develop a classification method for frailty
based on risk of death and risk of unplanned hospital
admission.Design Prospective open cohort study.Participants Routinely collected
data from 1436 general practices contributing data to QResearch in England
between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used to develop the scores and a
separate set of 357 practices to validate the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 
65-100 years were in the derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the
validation cohort.Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation
cohort were used to derive separate risk equations in men and women for
evaluation of the risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age,
sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index,
medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent
investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the
validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group.
The new mortality equation was used in conjunction with the existing QAdmissions 
equation (which predicts risk of unplanned hospital admission) to classify
patients into frailty groups.Main outcome measure The primary outcome was all
cause mortality.Results During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the
derivation cohort arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The
final model included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic
group, smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the past 
12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive heart failure,
corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, learning disability,
leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, poor
mobility, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2
diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result,
high platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite loss,
unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good calibration and
high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the equation
explained 55.6% of the variation in time to death (R2), and had very good
discrimination-the D statistic was 2.29, and Harrell's C statistic value was
0.85. The corresponding values for men were 53.1%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining
predicted risks of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7% of patients 
(n=13 665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4% (n=46 770) as moderately
frail, 43.1% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8% (n=223 790) as
fit.Conclusions We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of
death in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social,
and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate
validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction with the
QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty groups (known as
QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be identified for further assessment
or interventions.

It is often of interest to compare centers or healthcare providers on quality of 
care delivered. We consider the setting where evaluation of center performance on
multiple competing events is of interest. We propose estimating center effects
through cause-specific proportional hazards frailty models that allow correlation
among a center's cause-specific effects. Estimation of our model proceeds via
penalized partial likelihood and is implemented in R. To evaluate center
performance, we also propose a directly standardized excess cumulative incidence 
(ECI) measure. Therefore, based on our proposed methods, practitioners can
evaluate centers either through the cause-specific hazards or the cumulative
incidence functions. We demonstrate, through simulations, the advantages of the
proposed methods to detect outlying centers, by comparing the proposed methods
and existing methods which assume uncorrelated random center effects. In
addition, we develop a Correlation Score Test to test the null hypothesis that
the competing event processes within a center are correlated. Using data from the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we apply our method to evaluate the
performance of Organ Procurement Organizations on two competing risks: (i)
receipt of a kidney transplant and (ii) death on the wait-list.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Technique failure is a major limitation of peritoneal 
dialysis. Our study aimed to identify center- and patient-level predictors of
peritoneal dialysis technique failure.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All patients on incident
peritoneal dialysis in Australia from 2004 to 2014 were included in the study
using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry.
Center- and patient-level characteristics associated with technique failure were 
evaluated using Cox shared frailty models. Death-censored technique failure and
cause-specific technique failure were analyzed as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: The study included 9362 patients from 51 centers in Australia. The
technique failure rate was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.36) episodes 
per patient-year, with a sevenfold variation across centers that was mainly
associated with center-level characteristics. Technique failure was significantly
less likely in centers with larger proportions of patients treated with
peritoneal dialysis (>29%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 
0.73 to 0.94) and more likely in smaller centers (<16 new patients per year;
adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.21) and centers
with lower proportions of patients achieving target baseline serum phosphate
levels (<40%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to
1.29). Similar results were observed for death-censored technique failure, except
that center target phosphate achievement was not significantly associated.
Technique failure due to infection, social reasons, mechanical causes, or death
was variably associated with center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal
dialysis, and/or target phosphate achievement, automated peritoneal dialysis
exposure, icodextrin use, and antifungal use. The variation of hazards of
technique failure across centers was reduced by 28% after adjusting for
patient-specific factors and an additional 53% after adding center-specific
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Technique failure varies widely across centers in Australia. A
significant proportion of this variation is related to potentially modifiable
center characteristics, including peritoneal dialysis center size, proportion of 
patients on peritoneal dialysis, and proportion of patients on peritoneal
dialysis achieving target phosphate level.

BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the
general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear
whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney failure.
METHODS: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults with
end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South
America designed to examine the association between periodontitis and all-cause
and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis.
Participants were matched 1:1 on their propensity score for moderate to severe
periodontitis assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal 
Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared
frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries.
RESULTS: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe
periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score methods to generate a
matched cohort of participants with periodontitis similar to those with none or
mild periodontal disease, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a 
lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74,
95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 
person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were
not changed substantially when participants were limited to those with 12 or more
natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes of cardiovascular death.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does not appear 
to be associated with an increased risk of early death in adults treated with
hemodialysis.

The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT; ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT01206062) was stopped early because of significantly lower risk of
cardiovascular disease in participants randomized to a systolic blood pressure
target of 120 mmHg (intensive) than in those randomized to 140 mmHg (standard).
The cardiovascular outcome benefit was also identified in subjects aged 75 and
older assigned to the intensive arm-34% lower than in the standard arm-in
addition to 33% lower all-cause mortality at 3.14 years of follow-up. These
beneficial outcomes held in older participants characterized as frail or with
impaired gait speed. This article addresses several questions that need to be
considered in applying the SPRINT results to the clinical care of older adults:
Why are the SPRINT results discordant from those of epidemiological studies? Do
the SPRINT findings generalize to the frail, older adults that I care for? Were
there more adverse events in the intensive treatment group? What about cognitive 
and kidney outcomes? What are future considerations, and how low should we go?

Hypoalbuminemia, a frailty criterion, belongs to a group of co-morbidities not
captured as a traditional risk factor. We assessed its prognostic value in
patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The study 
included 1,215 consecutive patients from the Optimized Catheter Valvular
Intervention -TAVI Japanese multicenter registry. Hypoalbuminemia was defined as 
serum albumin level <3.5 g/dl. Baseline characteristics, procedural outcomes, and
all-cause, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality rates after TAVI were
compared between patients with albumin level <3.5 g/dl (hypo[h]-ALB group, n =
284) and those with albumin level >3.5 g/dl (nonhypo[nh]-ALB group, n = 931).
Several baseline characteristics differed significantly between both groups,
including age (85.1 ± 5.1 vs 84.2 ± 4.9 years, p = 0.012), ejection fraction
(58.5 ± 14.3% vs 62.9 ± 12.4%, p <0.001), baseline kidney function, or liver
disease. The 30-day mortality rate in all patients showed significant differences
between the 2 groups (3.9% vs 1.3%, p = 0.005). During a mean follow-up of
330 days, cumulative all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality
rates were significantly higher in the hALB group than in the nhALB group
(log-rank test, p <0.001, p = 0.0021, and p <0.001, respectively). The groups
were also analyzed using a propensity matching model for adjusting the baseline
differences. The analysis revealed that the poorer prognosis of the hALB group in
terms of cumulative all-cause and noncardiovascular mortality was retained (p =
0.038, and p = 0.0068, respectively); however, differences in cardiovascular
mortality rates in the 2 groups were attenuated (p = 0.93). In conclusion,
hypoalbuminemia was associated with poor prognosis, highlighted by the increase
in noncardiovascular mortality. Baseline albumin level could be a useful marker
for risk stratification before TAVI.

PURPOSE: Although a population's senescence rate is classically measured as the
increase in mortality rate with age on a logarithmic scale, it may be more
accurately measured as the increase on a linear scale. Patients on dialysis, who 
suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality
rate on a logarithmic scale, but a larger increase on a linear scale than
patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be
biased by population heterogeneity.
METHODS: Follow-up data on 323,308 patients on dialysis and 91,679 patients with 
a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We
measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models
that allow individual variation in this increase.
RESULTS: According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase 
in mortality rate on a logarithmic scale was smaller in patients on dialysis,
while the senescence rate measured as the increase on a linear scale was larger
in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant.
CONCLUSIONS: Also when accounting for population heterogeneity, a population's
senescence rate is more accurately measured as the increase in mortality rate on 
a linear scale than a logarithmic scale.

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its
impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
is less defined.
METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 
trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three
groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR
≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were
analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors
of 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the
PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767
(30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 
(12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted
Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with
severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher
prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of
death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate
and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% 
in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild
RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus
none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other
significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass
index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction,
oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male
sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year
mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is
required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

OBJECTIVES: Screening tools to determine which outpatients with cirrhosis are at 
highest risk for unplanned hospitalization are lacking. Frailty is a novel
prognostic factor but conventional screening for frailty is time consuming. We
evaluated the ability of a 1 min bedside screen (Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)) to
predict unplanned hospitalization or death in outpatients with cirrhosis and
compared the CFS with two conventional frailty measures (Fried Frailty Criteria
(FFC) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)).
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive outpatients from three tertiary
care liver clinics. Frailty was defined by CFS >4. The primary outcome was the
composite of unplanned hospitalization or death within 6 months of study entry.
RESULTS: A total of 300 outpatients were enrolled (mean age 57 years, 35% female,
81% white, 66% hepatitis C or alcohol-related liver disease, mean Model for
End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score 12, 28% with ascites). Overall, 54 (18%)
outpatients were frail and 91 (30%) patients had an unplanned hospitalization or 
death within 6 months. CFS >4 was independently associated with increased rates
of unplanned hospitalization or death (57% frail vs. 24% not frail, adjusted odds
ratio 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-7.5; P=0.0008) and there was a dose 
response (adjusted odds ratio 1.9 per 1-unit increase in CFS, 95% CI: 1.4-2.6;
P<0.0001). Models including MELD, ascites, and CFS >4 had a greater
discrimination (c-statistic=0.84) than models using FFC or SPPB.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is strongly and independently associated with an increased
risk of unplanned hospitalization or death in outpatients with cirrhosis. The CFS
is a rapid screen that could be easily adopted in liver clinics to identify those
at highest risk of adverse events.

IMPORTANCE: Efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on
patients with cancer. High-quality end-of-life care is also critical for patients
with other illnesses.
OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of end-of-life care and family-rated quality of
care for patients dying with different serious illnesses.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was
conducted in all 146 inpatient facilities within the Veteran Affairs health
system among patients who died in inpatient facilities between October 1, 2009,
and September 30, 2012, with clinical diagnoses categorized as end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), cancer, cardiopulmonary failure (congestive heart failure or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), dementia, frailty, or other conditions.
Data analysis was conducted from April 1, 2014, to February 10, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Palliative care consultations, do-not-resuscitate
orders, death in inpatient hospices, death in the intensive care unit, and
family-reported quality of end-of-life care.
RESULTS: Among 57 753 decedents, approximately half of the patients with ESRD,
cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty received palliative care consultations
(adjusted proportions, 50.4%, 46.7%, and 43.7%, respectively) vs 73.5% of
patients with cancer and 61.4% of patients with dementia (P < .001).
Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or
frailty (adjusted proportions, 32.3%, 34.1%, and 35.2%, respectively) died in the
intensive care unit, more than double the rates among patients with cancer and
those with dementia (13.4% and 8.9%, respectively) (P < .001). Rates of excellent
quality of end-of-life care reported by 34 005 decedents' families were similar
for patients with cancer and those with dementia (adjusted proportions, 59.2% and
59.3%; P = .61), but lower for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or
frailty (54.8%, 54.8%, and 53.7%, respectively; all P ≤ .02 vs patients with
cancer). This quality advantage was mediated by palliative care consultation,
setting of death, and a code status of do-not-resuscitate; adjustment for these
variables rendered the association between diagnosis and overall end-of-life care
quality nonsignificant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Family-reported quality of end-of-life care was
significantly better for patients with cancer and those with dementia than for
patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty, largely owing to higher 
rates of palliative care consultation and do-not-resuscitate orders and fewer
deaths in the intensive care unit among patients with cancer and those with
dementia. Increasing access to palliative care and goals of care discussions that
address code status and preferred setting of death, particularly for patients
with end-organ failure and frailty, may improve the overall quality of
end-of-life care for Americans dying of these illnesses.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

PURPOSE: Prognosis of the increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) is poor with high risk of functional decline and mortality. 
Frailty seems to be a good predictor for those patients that will not benefit
from dialysis. Varying prevalences between populations are probably related to
the instrument used. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of
frailty among ESRD patients with two different validated instruments.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients, aged ≥18 years,
receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis care between
September 2013 and December 2013 in a single dialysis center in Apeldoorn, the
Netherlands. Frailty was measured with the frailty index (FI) and frailty
phenotype (FP).
RESULTS: Prevalence of frailty by the FI was 36.8 % among 95 participants with
ESRD (age: 65.2 years, SD ± 12.0). Frailty prevalence among participants aged ≥65
and <65 years was 43.6 and 27.5 %, respectively. Female sex [odds ratio (OR) 3.3,
95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.3-8.0] and a Charlson comorbidity index score of 
≥5 (OR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.0-6.6) were associated with frailty. The FI identified
different but overlapping participants as frail compared with the FP; 62.5 % of
frail participants according to FI were also frail according to the FP.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of frailty among young and elderly ESRD patients is high;
being female and having more comorbidity was associated with frailty. Use of a
broader definition of frailty, like the FI, gives a higher estimation of
prevalence among ESRD patients compared with a physical frailty assessment.

BACKGROUND: Surgical risk scores do not include frailty assessments (eg, gait
speed), which are of particular importance for patients with severe aortic
stenosis considering transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the association of 5-m gait speed with outcomes 
in a cohort of 8039 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement
(November 2011-June 2014) and were included in the Society of Thoracic
Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry. We 
evaluated the association between continuous and categorical gait speed and
30-day all-cause mortality before and after adjustment for Society of Thoracic
Surgeons-predicted risk of mortality score and key variables. Secondary outcomes 
included in-hospital mortality, bleeding, acute kidney injury, and stroke. The
overall median gait speed was 0.63 m/s (25th-75th percentile, 0.47-0.79 m/s),
with the slowest walkers (<0.5 m/s) constituting 28%, slow walkers (0.5-0.83 m/s)
making up 48%, and normal walkers (>0.83 m/s) constituting 24% of the population.
Thirty-day all-cause mortality rates were 8.4%, 6.6%, and 5.4% for the slowest,
slow, and normal walkers, respectively (P<0.001). Each 0.2-m/s decrease in gait
speed corresponded to an 11% increase in 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio,
1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.22). The slowest walkers had 35% higher
30-day mortality than normal walkers (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence
interval, 1.01-1.80), significantly longer hospital stays, and a lower
probability of being discharged to home.
CONCLUSIONS: Gait speed is independently associated with 30-day mortality after
transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Identification of frail patients with the
slowest gait speeds facilitates preprocedural evaluation and anticipation of a
higher level of postprocedural care.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is related
to frailty and to characterize the nature of their joint association with
mortality.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis for frailty and longitudinal cohort analysis for
mortality.
SETTING: Cardiovascular Health Study.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals (N = 2,977; mean age 77.9 ± 4.7, 40%
male, 83% white).
MEASUREMENTS: The predictor was serum FGF-23 concentration (C-terminal
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the outcomes were frailty status
(determined according to frailty phenotype criteria of weight loss, weakness,
exhaustion, slowness, and low physical activity) and mortality. Multinomial
logistic regression was used to assess the cross-sectional association between
FGF-23 and frailty and prefrailty, adjusting for demographic characteristics,
cardiovascular disease and risk factors, and kidney markers. Proportional hazards
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between
FGF-23, frailty, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 64 ± 17 mL/min per 
1.73 m(2) . Median FGF-23 was 70.3 RU/mL (interquartile range 53.4-99.2); 52%
were prefrail, and 13% were frail. After multivariate adjustment, each doubling
in FGF-23 concentration was associated with 38% (95% confidence interval (CI) =
17-62%) higher odds of frailty than of nonfrailty and 16% (95% CI = 3-30%) higher
odds of prefrailty. FGF-23 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.10-1.23) and
frailty (HR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.57-2.12) were independently associated with
mortality, but neither association was meaningfully attenuated when adjusted for 
the other.
CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of older adults, higher FGF-23 was independently
associated with prevalent frailty and prefrailty. FGF-23 and frailty were
independent and additive risk factors for mortality. FGF-23 may be a marker for
functional outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement
can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light
chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies
have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We
evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in
France.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered
in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 
with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored
for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as
renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and 
causes of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334
(23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72
years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was
observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation
was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis,
67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were 
malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and
cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty 
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high
BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is
poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of
death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been reported regarding impact of body mass 
index (BMI) on outcome of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients.
This study evaluates the impact of BMI on 1 year mortality in patients undergoing
TAVR via the transfemoral (TF) access.
METHODS: Aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing TAVR via a TF access between
May 2007 and December 2014 were categorized to 4 groups by BMI: low (<20), normal
(20-24.9), overweight (25-30), and obese (>30). Baseline parameters were
compared, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were
generated to assess outcome differences.
RESULTS: Among 491 severe AS TAVR patients, 43 had low BMI, 148 had normal BMI,
162 were overweight, and 138 were obese. Obese patients were younger with lower
Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores and higher rates of preserved ejection
fraction and diabetes. There was a higher rate of women in the BMI extremes.
Aortic valve area was higher among obese patients; however, the indexed area was 
inversely correlated with BMI. Vascular complications and transfusions were more 
common in the low-BMI group, while acute kidney injury was more common in obese
patients. All-cause mortality at 1 year was higher in the low-BMI group (log-rank
p = 0.003) with no significant difference among normal and above-normal BMI
patients. In a multivariate model, BMI <20 kg/m(2) was an independent predictor
of mortality (HR = 2.45, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: BMI <20 kg/m(2) should be considered a frailty marker during the
screening process of severe AS TAVR patients as it is associated with higher
mortality, while obesity confers similar mortality risk as normal weight. © 2015

Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among
the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample
evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the
best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to
remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this
population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive
impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to
transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after
transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and
affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can
increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death
with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney
allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft
utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer
wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to
kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and
propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the
elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in
comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly
individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength,
body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and
endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined
outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were
assessed.
METHODS: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient
drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12
months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc
Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail
and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition
(DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years 
old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After 
some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30
to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; 
IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 
14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 
2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the 
casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that
frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney
disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either
worse endothelial function or mortality.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established technique for
the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Data on long-term TAVI
outcomes, both hemodynamic and clinical, in real-world practice settings are
limited. We aim to explore the long-term clinical results in patients with severe
symptomatic aortic stenosis using multiple catheter-based options: 360
TAVI-treated patients were followed up for ≤5 years. The Medtronic CoreValve was 
used in 71% and the Edwards SAPIEN in 26%. The primary end point was all-cause
mortality during follow-up. Outcomes were assessed based on the Valve Academic
Research Consortium 2 criteria. The mean ± SD patient age was 82.1 ± 6.9 years
(56.4% women). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 7.5 ± 4.7. The clinical
efficacy end point and time-related valve safety at 3 years was 50% and 81.7%,
respectively. The calculated 3- and 5-year survival rates were 71.6% and 56.4%,
respectively. Five-year follow-up data were obtained for 54 patients alive; 96.2%
of alive patients were in the New York Heart Association class I and II, 4 years 
after TAVI. No gender differences in all-cause mortality rates were observed (p =
0.58). In multivariate analysis, hospitalization 6 months previous to TAVI
(hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 3.15, p = 0.01),
frailty (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.2, p = 0.02), acute kidney injury (HR 1.93,
95% CI 1.03 to 3.61, p = 0.04), and moderate or more paravalvular aortic
regurgitation after TAVI (HR 4.26, 95% CI 2.54 to 7.15, p <0.001) were
independent predictors for all-cause mortality. In conclusion, long-term outcomes
of TAVI are encouraging. Prevention and early identification of paravalvular leak
and acute renal failure after the procedure would improve short- and long-term
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Dental disease is more extensive in adults with chronic kidney
disease, but whether dental health and behaviors are associated with survival in 
the setting of hemodialysis is unknown.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multinational cohort.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,205 adults treated with long-term hemodialysis, 2010 to
2012 (Oral Diseases in Hemodialysis [ORAL-D] Study).
PREDICTORS: Dental health as assessed by a standardized dental examination using 
World Health Organization guidelines and personal oral care, including
edentulousness; decayed, missing, and filled teeth index; teeth brushing and
flossing; and dental health consultation.
OUTCOMES: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months after dental
assessment.
MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models
fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within
countries.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 22.1 months, 942 deaths occurred, including
477 cardiovascular deaths. Edentulousness (adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.51) 
and decayed, missing, or filled teeth score ≥ 14 (adjusted HR, 1.70; 95% CI,
1.33-2.17) were associated with early all-cause mortality, while dental flossing,
using mouthwash, brushing teeth daily, spending at least 2 minutes on oral
hygiene daily, changing a toothbrush at least every 3 months, and visiting a
dentist within the past 6 months (adjusted HRs of 0.52 [95% CI, 0.32-0.85], 0.79 
[95% CI, 0.64-0.97], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58-0.99], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-0.99], 0.79
[95% CI, 0.65-0.95], and 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.96], respectively) were associated 
with better survival. Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar.
LIMITATIONS: Convenience sample of clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: In adults treated with hemodialysis, poorer dental health was
associated with early death, whereas preventive dental health practices were
associated with longer survival.

Aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of chronic diseases such as
arthritis, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, Alzheimer's
disease, macular degeneration, frailty, and certain forms of cancers. It is
widely regarded that chronic inflammation may be a common link in all these
age-related diseases. This raises the question, can one alter the course of aging
and potentially slow the development of all chronic diseases by manipulating the 
mechanisms that cause age-related inflammation? Emerging evidence suggests that
pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18 show an age-dependent
regulation implicating inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation in the aging
process. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) family of innate immune cell sensors, such
as the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin
domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome controls the caspase-1 activation in
myeloid-lineage cells in several organs during aging. The NLRP3 inflammasome is
especially relevant to aging as it can get activated in response to structurally 
diverse damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as extracellular ATP,
excess glucose, ceramides, amyloids, urate, and cholesterol crystals, all of
which increase with age. Interestingly, reduction in NLRP3-mediated inflammation 
prevents age-related insulin resistance, bone loss, cognitive decline, and
frailty. NLRP3 is a major driver of age-related inflammation and therefore
dietary or pharmacological approaches to lower aberrant inflammasome activation
holds promise in reducing multiple chronic diseases of age and may enhance
healthspan.

Controlling Time-Dependent Confounding by Health Status and Frailty: Restriction 
Versus Statistical Adjustment.

McGrath LJ, Ellis AR, Brookhart MA.

Nonexperimental studies of preventive interventions are often biased because of
the healthy-user effect and, in frail populations, because of confounding by
functional status. Bias is evident when estimating influenza vaccine
effectiveness, even after adjustment for claims-based indicators of illness. We
explored bias reduction methods while estimating vaccine effectiveness in a
cohort of adult hemodialysis patients. Using the United States Renal Data System 
and linked data from a commercial dialysis provider, we estimated vaccine
effectiveness using a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model of
all-cause mortality before and during 3 influenza seasons in 2005/2006 through
2007/2008. To improve confounding control, we added frailty indicators to the
model, measured time-varying confounders at different time intervals, and
restricted the sample in multiple ways. Crude and baseline-adjusted marginal
structural models remained strongly biased. Restricting to a healthier population
removed some unmeasured confounding; however, this reduced the sample size,
resulting in wide confidence intervals. We estimated an influenza vaccine
effectiveness of 9% (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.15)
when bias was minimized through cohort restriction. In this study, the
healthy-user bias could not be controlled through statistical adjustment;
however, sample restriction reduced much of the bias.

BACKGROUND: The levels of many laboratory parameters are associated with the
outcomes of dialysis patients, but the significance of their variability has not 
been well studied.
METHODS: A total of 384 patients receiving stable hemodialysis treatment during
2002 were followed up for mortality until the end of 2013. The within-patient
coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for 13 laboratory parameters from 
1 year of data. We defined variability as CV and analyzed the survival of the
patients according to the baseline CV values of each parameter by proportional
hazard modeling.
RESULTS: During the 11-year observation period, 125 patients died. Higher CV
levels for eight parameters, namely, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium,
hemoglobin, creatinine, total protein, albumin, potassium and phosphate, were
significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The adjusted hazard ratios for
a high BUN-CV (>15 %) and a high Na-CV (>1.3 %) against a lower CV were 1.92 (95 
% CI 1.31-2.81) and 1.95 (1.36-2.80), respectively. The increased mortality risk 
associated with each variability was attributed to excess non-cardiac deaths. The
CV values of most parameters were correlated with each other and often exhibited 
negative associations with age, diabetes, and mobility as well as the levels of
hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, Na, the protein catabolic rate, and the
creatinine generation rate. Therefore, a high variability was generally
associated with frailty-related adverse prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The variability of several blood parameters had a significant impact
on all-cause and non-cardiac mortality. The levels of the variabilities were most
likely related to poor physical conditions of the patients.

BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose reduction 
or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead to rejection and
possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known about what factors might
cause or contribute to MDR. Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is
emerging as an important, novel domain of risk in kidney transplantation
recipients. We hypothesized that frailty, an inflammatory phenotype, might be
associated with MDR.
METHODS: We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical
activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor characteristics,
longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 kidney transplantation recipients. 
Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: By 2 years after transplantation, 54% of frail recipients and 45% of
nonfrail recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67% and 51%. Frail
recipients were 1.29 times (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.66; P =
0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased donor recipients (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.44-2.54, P < 0.001) and older adults (age ≥
65 vs <65; aHR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.96, P = 0.01). Mycophenolate mofetil dose
reduction was independently associated with a substantially increased risk of
death-censored graft loss (aHR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.97-13.98, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A better understanding of risk factors for MMF intolerance might help
in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression and
prolong allograft survival.

Today, old age does not represent a formal contraindication to kidney
transplantation. Rather, there is evidence that in elderly patients renal
transplantation offers longer life expectancy and better quality of life in
comparison with dialysis. Yet, the results of renal transplantation in recipients
older than 65years are inferior to those observed in younger adults, death with
functioning graft representing a major cause of failure. Therefore, the selection
of aged patients is of paramount importance. Apart from the routine clinical and 
biological investigations, three aspects have been relatively neglected by the
transplant community and may require a careful analysis in elderly candidates to 
transplantation: the presence and degree of frailty, the presence of
comorbidities and the adherence to prescriptions. Although there are rapid and
simple tests for assessing the degree of frailty in the elderly, there is no
clear cut-off value to decide whether a patient should be accepted or not. With
advanced age the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular events and other
diseases tend to increase. The use of combined age-comorbidity indices may be
helpful to identify patients at high risk of mortality. Another critical point is
the poor unintentional adherence to treatment, often caused by forgetfulness and 
mild cognitive impairment. These drawbacks may be further enhanced by a high
number of pills to take and by changes in the dosage or type of prescriptions. A 
careful screening of the presence and degree of frailty, comorbidity and poor
compliance to treatment is highly recommended before admitting older candidates
to the waiting list for transplantation.

AIMS: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) represents a less invasive
treatment option for elderly patients. Therefore, we aimed to determine the
impact of frailty measured by the Katz Index of activities of daily living (ADL) 
on short- and long-term mortality after TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Our study included 300 consecutive patients (mean age, 82±5 
years) who had undergone TAVI at our institution (158 transapical, 142
transfemoral procedures). At baseline, 144 patients were impaired in at least one
ADL and therefore defined as frail (Katz Index <6). Regarding in-hospital
outcome, all serious complications except for stage 3 acute kidney injury were
equally distributed in both groups, but early mortality was significantly higher 
in frail persons (5.5% vs. 1.3%, p=0.04 for immediate procedural mortality; 17%
vs. 5.8%, p=0.002 for 30-day mortality; and 23% vs. 6.4%, p<0.0001 for procedural
mortality). The risk-score-based 30-day mortality estimates (29% vs. 24% for log.
EuroSCORE I, 9.5% vs. 7.5% for EuroSCORE II, and 8.8% vs. 5.9% for STS score)
reflected neither the observed 30-day mortality in both groups nor the threefold 
risk elevation in frail patients. In contrast, the Katz Index <6 was identified
as a significant independent predictor of long-term all-cause mortality by
multivariate analysis (HR 2.67 [95% CI: 1.7-4.3], p<0.0001). During follow-up
(median observation period 537 days) 56% of frail vs. 24% of non-frail patients
died.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty status measured by the Katz Index represents a powerful
predictor of adverse early and late outcome after TAVI, whereas commonly used
risk scores lack calibration and discrimination in a TAVI-specific patient
cohort. Therefore, we propose the incorporation of this simple and reproducible
measure into pre-TAVI risk assessment.

Older people have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) of
any age group and are thus frequent users of glucose-lowering agents. Because
individuals 65 years or older are underrepresented in clinical studies, there is 
a lack of information regarding the efficacy and safety of available treatments
in this population. Additionally, a high prevalence of comorbidities,
polypharmacy, and frailty can make treatment of T2DM in this population
challenging. Safety is an important consideration when choosing a treatment for
older individuals. Renal impairment is quite common in older patients with T2DM
and can contribute to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can lead to serious
consequences, such as falls and fractures, and cognitive changes. As such,
hemoglobin A₁c treatment targets, typically <7% in the general population, are
less stringent in older people, with the goal being an individualized target that
balances efficacy and safety. Many glucose-lowering agents can cause adverse
events detrimental to older individuals, such as hypoglycemia (insulin,
sulfonylureas), weight gain (sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones), gastrointestinal
events (metformin), and fractures (thiazolidinediones), and are contraindicated
or require dose adjustments in those with renal impairment (most oral/injectable 
agents). Orally administered dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors have a low
risk of hypoglycemia and are generally well tolerated. Linagliptin is the only
DPP-4 inhibitor excreted through nonrenal pathways and therefore does not require
any dose adjustment in older patients with kidney disease. This paper reviews the
findings of a recent study by Barnett et al assessing the efficacy and safety of 
the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin in patients with T2DM aged 70 years or older,
which concluded that linagliptin may be a useful glucose-lowering option for
older patients with T2DM.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among elderly people is
increasing. Often associated with disabilities/comorbidities, T2DM lowers the
chances of successful aging and is independently associated with frailty and an
increased risk of hypoglycaemia, which can be further exacerbated by
antihyperglycaemic treatment. From this perspective, the clinical management of
T2DM in the elderly is challenging and requires individualization of optimum
glycaemic targets depending on comorbidities, cognitive functioning and ability
to recognize and self-manage the disease. The lack of solid evidence-based
medicine supporting treatment guidelines for older people with diabetes further
complicates the matter. Several classes of medicine for the treatment of T2DM are
currently available and different drug combinations are often required to achieve
individualized glycaemic goals. Many of these drugs, however, carry disadvantages
such as the propensity to cause weight gain or hypoglycaemia. Dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, a recent addition to the pharmacological
armamentarium, have become widely accepted in clinical practice because of their 
efficacy, low risk of hypoglycaemia, neutral effect on body weight, and
apparently greater safety in patients with kidney failure. Although more
information is needed to reach definitive conclusions, growing evidence suggests 
that DPP-4 inhibitors may become a valuable component in the pharmacological
management of elderly people with T2DM. The present review aims to delineate the 
potential advantages of this pharmacological approach in the treatment of elderly
people with T2DM.

The equations for estimating kidney function have become very popular in the last
decade. However, the clinical and prognostic meaning of these measures may be
very different in older populations. Two cohorts of people aged 65-89 years
(older sample) and 90 or more (oldest old sample) were used to investigate the
prognostic significance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
Additionally, we also investigated whether combining frailty and eGFR may improve
the accuracy of frailty in predicting mortality. We found that lower eGFR values 
were significantly more frequent among frail subjects in both groups. eGFR < 30
was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality either in subjects
aged 65-89 years (HR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.23-11.2) or in those aged 90 or more
(HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.05-2.23). In the latter group, a not significant trend for
increasing mortality was also observed among people with eGFR > 60 (HR = 1.28,
95% CI = 0.72-2.26). In addition, the oldest old subjects with eGFR > 60 and
eGFR < 30 had the lowest hand-grip strength and ADL values. Combining eGFR and
frailty status significantly improved the accuracy of frailty in predicting
mortality only in the older sample. In conclusion, a U-shaped relationship exists
between eGFR and mortality in the oldest old, but not in older individuals. Our
findings suggest that eGFR needs to be adjusted for muscle mass/physical
performance when estimating kidney function in people aged 90 or more.
Nevertheless, in subjects aged 65-89 years, eGFR may improve the accuracy of
frailty status in predicting prognosis, thus suggesting that eGFR may represent
an additional dimension of frailty syndrome.

Center, Baltimore VA Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in 
individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on 
their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of
cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that
highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid
conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating
cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including
microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally,
studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected
in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with
worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk
of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible
short-term effects on markers of physical performance.
SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to 
better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides
(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

Uric acid (UA) is produced from purines by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, and
elevated levels may cause arthritis and kidney stones. Conversely, UA also
appears to function as an antioxidant and may protect against the oxidative
stress associated with aging and disease. We performed a prospective fracture
case-cohort study to understand the relation of UA and fracture risk in older men
enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. In the cohort of 5994
men aged 65 years and older attending the baseline MrOS examination, we evaluated
a subgroup 1680 men in a case-cohort study design. The analytic group included
387 men with incident nonspine fractures (73 hip) and a random sample of 1383.
Serum UA was measured in baseline serum samples. Modified proportional hazards
models that account for case-cohort study design were used to estimate the
relative hazards (RH) of hip and nonspine fracture in men for serum UA. Models
were adjusted for age, race, clinic site, body mass index, vitamin D, parathyroid
hormone, walking speed, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score,
frailty, and total. Subjects with incident nonspine fractures were older, had
lower total hip bone mineral density (BMD), and higher serum phosphorus. There
was an 18% decreased risk of nonspine fractures (95% confidence interval [CI]
0.71-0.93; p = 0.003) per 1 SD increase of baseline serum and 34% decreased risk 
of nonspine fractures in quartile 4 of UA versus quartiles 1, 2, and 3 (95% CI
0.49-0.89; p = 0.028) compared with nonfracture cases after multivariate
adjustment. Hip fractures were not significantly associated with UA. Total hip
BMD was significantly higher in the group of men with high UA levels compared
with lower UA levels and increased linearly across quartiles of UA after
multivariate adjustment (p for trend = 0.002). In summary, higher serum UA levels
were associated with a reduction in risk of incident nonspine fractures but not
hip fractures and higher hip BMD.

The association of physical activity and physical function with clinical outcomes
in adults with chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of
physical functioning and encouragement of physical activity in management of the 
patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), implementation has been undermined by 
a lack of understanding of the evidence for this recommendation. The purpose of
this review is to present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic
cohorts that report associations between low levels of physical functioning
and/or low physical activity and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Low levels of physical activity and poor physical functioning
are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical outcomes in adult
patients with CKD, regardless of treatment modality. Low physical performance and
activity limitations are more prevalent in patients with CKD, regardless of age, 
compared to older community-dwelling adults.
SUMMARY: The strength of the evidence presented should strongly motivate a focus 
of treatment on assessing and improving physical activity and physical function
as part of routine patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical
activity interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of
age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that is
similar to or higher than the general population of elderly adults; physical
activity, physical function, and performance are strongly associated with
all-cause mortality; and exercise training and exercise counseling have been
shown to improve measures of physical functioning.

BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in management have been highlighted as contributory
factors in the death of many patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). However,
there is little evidence addressing the quality of care provided to patients with
milder AKI.
AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of care provided to a
non-select cohort of patients with AKI and evaluate discrepancies in causation,
recognition and management.
DESIGN: Retrospective inception cohort study.
METHODS: Demographic data were collected for all 1577 patients admitted to a
University Teaching Hospital during a 1-month period. Baseline, admission and
peak creatinine were correlated with mortality and length of hospital admission. 
AKI was classified according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
criteria. A retrospective case note review of all patients with AKI was carried
out to evaluate quality of documentation and clinical management of AKI.
Multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors for AKI.
RESULTS: Incidence of AKI on admission was 4.6%. A further 10.3% developed AKI
while in hospital. All cause mortality was 4-fold higher among patients with AKI 
compared with those without (19 vs. 3.8%; P < 0.001). Mortality was significantly
higher in those patients who developed AKI while an in-patient compared with
those with AKI on admission (27.3 vs. 11.8%; P < 0.001). Diabetes, clinician
perception of frailty, age and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor prior to admission were found to be independent risk factors for AKI.
AKI was unrecognized in 23.5% of patients, two-thirds of whom were discharged
without resolution of renal function. Significant weaknesses in management were
poorly kept fluid balance charts (48.2%), failure to withhold nephrotoxic drugs
(38.8%) and failure to act upon abnormal biochemistry (41%) in a timely fashion.
CONCLUSION: AKI is common in hospitalized patients and associated with a
significant increase in hospital stay and mortality. AKI is often found in
conjunction with other organ failure and in many cases is not preventable.
Nevertheless clinicians need to be more vigilant of small creatinine rises to
permit early intervention particularly among elderly and frail patients.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced
functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing
the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the
CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or
evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based
cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study.
OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association
with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more
of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss,
exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum
cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to
relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was
51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much
older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components
were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes,
eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a
2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of
frailty compared with GFR(cys) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during 
a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was
associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or 
dialysis therapy.
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal
relationships between CKD and frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is
associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.

BACKGROUND: For chronic hemodialysis, the ideal permanent vascular access is the 
arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Temporary catheters should be reserved for acute
dialysis needs. The AVF is associated with lower infection rates, better clinical
results, and a higher quality of life and survival when compared to temporary
catheters. In Brazil, the proportion of patients with temporary catheters for
more than 3 months from the beginning of therapy is used as an evaluation of the 
quality of renal units. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated
with the time between the beginning of hemodialysis with temporary catheters and 
the placement of the first arteriovenous fistula in Brazil.
METHODS: This is an observational, prospective non-concurrent study using
national administrative registries of all patients financed by the public health 
system who began renal replacement therapy (RRT) between 2000 and 2004 in Brazil.
Incident patients were eligible who had hemodialysis for the first time. Patients
were excluded who: had hemodialysis reportedly started after the date of death
(inconsistent database); were younger than 18 years old; had HIV; had no record
of the first dialysis unit; and were dialyzed in units with less than twenty
patients. To evaluate individual and renal unit factors associated with the event
of interest, the frailty model was used (N = 55,589).
RESULTS: Among the 23,824 patients (42.9%) who underwent fistula placement in the
period of the study, 18.2% maintained the temporary catheter for more than three 
months until the fistula creation. The analysis identified five statistically
significant factors associated with longer time until first fistula: higher age
(Hazard-risk - HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00); having hypertension and cardiovascular
diseases (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.98) as the cause of chronic renal disease;
residing in capitals cities (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95) and certain regions in
Brazil - South (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.8-0.87), Midwest (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94),
Northeast (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94), or North (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94) and
the type of renal unit (public or private).
CONCLUSION: Monitoring the provision of arteriovenous fistulas in renal units
could improve the care given to patients with end stage renal disease.

Thyroid hormone abnormalities and frailty in elderly patients with chronic kidney
disease: a hypothesis.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults,
affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are
encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap
with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder 
may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded
in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed 
to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is
being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization
and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low
testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of
whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly
CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In
this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone
abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with
CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors 
predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and
treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
importance.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

BACKGROUND: Given the volume and cost of inpatient care during the last year of
life, there is a critical need to identify patterns of dying as a means of
planning end-of-life care services, especially for the growing number of older
persons who receive services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
METHODS: A retrospective computerized record review was conducted of 20,933 VHA
patients who died as inpatients between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002.
Diagnoses were aggregated into one of five classification patterns of death and
analyzed in terms of health care resource utilization (mean number of inpatient
days and cumulative outpatient visits in the year preceding the patient's death).
RESULTS: Cancer deaths were the most common (30.4%) followed by end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) (23.2%), cardiopulmonary failure (21.4%), frailty (11.6%), "other"
diagnoses (7.3%), and sudden deaths (6.1%). Those with ESRD were more likely to
be male and nonwhite (p < 0.05) and those with frailty were more likely to be
older and married (p < 0.05). Controlling for demographic variables, those with
frailty had the highest number of inpatient days while those with ESRD had the
highest number of outpatient visits. Non-married status was associated with more 
inpatient days, especially among younger decedents.
CONCLUSION: As a recognized leader in end-of-life care, the VHA can play a unique
role in the development of specific interventions that address the diverse needs 
of persons with different dying trajectories identified through this research.

This study investigated mortality in 568 individuals from the Goessel Mennonite
community in rural central Kansas. There were three main objectives to this
research: 1) characterize mortality trends within a biologically well-defined
Mennonite community; 2) determine what biochemical, morphological, and
physiological risk factors could be related to all-cause mortality, stratified by
age and sex; and 3) compare these results to previously described variables that 
were associated with both biological age and mortality in this population.
Mortality data were obtained from three sources: Kansas Vital Records, the Social
Security death index, and church records. In total, 221 (39%) individuals were
found to have died in this population between January 1980-June 2002. Analogous
to the larger US population, the three leading causes of death in this community 
were heart disease, cancer, and stroke, accounting for 60% of all deaths. Besides
advancing age, the greatest biological risk factor in this population was
decreased amounts of albumin in men (relative risk, 2.47), potentially indicating
underreported cases of either chronic kidney disease or frailty syndrome for
males. Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated that increased amounts of
total cholesterol may provide a protective effect for elderly individuals. We
conclude, based on the previously described heritability of both albumin (h(2) = 
0.40) and total cholesterol (h(2) = 0.50) in this population, that underlying
genetic factors associated with both chronic degenerative diseases and biological
aging may have important implications for understanding mortality patterns in
this community.

The emergence of the sub-speciality geriatric nephrology is an exciting
development for the future. The main objectives should be to maximise patient
independence and minimise deterioration and learn dependent behaviour in this
population. To achieve these goals a holistic approach needs to be taken, to the 
patient, their environment and the efficacy of such units, and this can only be
achieved using a multi-disciplinary team approach. In the creation of a geriatric
nephrology unit it is important to identify the factors that cause frailty and,
if possible, modify or prevent the initial decline using nutritional and other
interventions. This requires careful monitoring, not only using the traditional
markers of renal disease including urea and creatinine, but also using
instruments that measure functional ability. These issues are discussed under the
headings prevention, documentation and planning.
