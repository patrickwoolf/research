BACKGROUND: Loss of muscle mass worsens many diseases such as cancer and renal
failure, contributes to the frailty syndrome, and is associated with an increased
risk of death. Studies conducted on animal models have revealed the preponderant 
role of muscle proteolysis and in particular the activation of the ubiquitin
proteasome system (UPS). Studies conducted in humans remain scarce, especially
within renal deficiency. Whether a shared atrophying programme exists
independently of the nature of the disease remains to be established. The aim of 
this work was to identify common modifications at the transcriptomic level or the
proteomic level in atrophying skeletal muscles from cancer and renal failure
patients.
METHODS: Muscle biopsies were performed during scheduled interventions in
early-stage (no treatment and no detectable muscle loss) lung cancer (LC),
chronic haemodialysis (HD), or healthy (CT) patients (n = 7 per group; 86% male; 
69.6 ± 11.4, 67.9 ± 8.6, and 70.2 ± 7.9 years P > 0.9 for the CT, LC, and HD
groups, respectively). Gene expression of members of the UPS, autophagy, and
apoptotic systems was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. A global analysis
of the soluble muscle proteome was conducted by shotgun proteomics for
investigating the processes altered.
RESULTS: We found an increased expression of several UPS and autophagy-related
enzymes in both LC and HD patients. The E3 ligases MuRF1 (+56 to 78%, P < 0.01), 
MAFbx (+68 to 84%, P = 0.02), Hdm2 (+37 to 59%, P = 0.02), and MUSA1/Fbxo30 (+47 
to 106%, P = 0.01) and the autophagy-related genes CTPL (+33 to 47%, P = 0.03)
and SQSTM1 (+47 to 137%, P < 0.01) were overexpressed. Mass spectrometry
identified >1700 proteins, and principal component analysis revealed three
differential proteomes that matched to the three groups of patients. Orthogonal
partial least square discriminant analysis created a model, which distinguished
the muscles of diseased patients (LC or HD) from those of CT subjects. Proteins
that most contributed to the model were selected. Functional analysis revealed up
to 238 proteins belonging to nine metabolic processes (inflammatory response,
proteolysis, cytoskeleton organization, glucose metabolism, muscle contraction,
oxidant detoxification, energy metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and
extracellular matrix) involved in and/or altered by the atrophying programme in
both LC and HD patients. This was confirmed by a co-expression network analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: We were able to identify highly similar modifications of several
metabolic pathways in patients exhibiting diseases with different aetiologies
(early-stage LC vs. long-term renal failure). This strongly suggests that a
common atrophying programme exists independently of the disease in human.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) candidates often present with multiple
comorbidities. These patients also have a substantial burden of frailty, which is
also associated with increased mortality. However, it is unknown if frailty is
merely a surrogate for comorbidity, itself an independent domain of risk, or if
frailty and comorbidity have differential effects. Better understanding the
interplay between these 2 constructs will improve clinical decision making in KT 
candidates.
OBJECTIVE: To test whether comorbidity is equally associated with waitlist
mortality among frail and nonfrail KT candidates and to test whether measuring
both comorbidity burden and frailty improves mortality risk prediction.
METHODS: We studied 2,086 candidates on the KT waitlist (November 2009 - October 
2017) in a multicenter cohort study, in whom frailty and comorbidity were
measured at evaluation. We quantified the association between Charlson
comorbidity index (CCI) adapted for end-stage renal disease and waitlist
mortality using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model and tested whether
this association differed between frail and nonfrail candidates.
RESULTS: At evaluation, 18.1% of KT candidates were frail and 51% had a high
comorbidity burden (CCI score ≥2). Candidates with a high comorbidity burden were
at 1.38-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.89) increased risk of waitlist mortality. However,
this association differed by frailty status (p for interaction = 0.01): among
nonfrail candidates, a high comorbidity burden was associated with a 1.66-fold
(95% CI 1.17-2.35) increased mortality risk; among frail candidates, here was no 
statistically significant association (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.44-1.29). Adding this
interaction between comorbidity and frailty to a mortality risk estimation model 
significantly improved prediction, increasing the c-statistic from 0.640 to 0.656
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Nonfrail candidates with a high comorbidity burden at KT evaluation 
have an increased risk of waitlist mortality. Importantly, comorbidity is less of
a concern in already high-risk patients who are frail.

Renal allotransplantation clearly offers better survival and quality of life for 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients than chronic dialysis. The median waiting
time for a deceased donor kidney in a suitable ESRD patient is 3.9 years. The
initial candidates for pig kidney xenotransplantation will be those with ESRD
unlikely to receive an allograft within a reasonable period of time. It is thus
reasonable to ascertain whether clinical trials of xenotransplantation might
likewise offer superior outcomes. Chronic dialysis in patients with ESRD is
associated with poor quality of life, significant morbidity, and relatively high 
mortality, with only 56% surviving 3 years and 42% at 5 years. However, a
significant number of these patients, because of comorbidities, frailty, etc,
would not be considered for renal allotransplantation and likely not for
xenotransplantation. As genetically engineered pig kidneys have satisfactorily
supported life in immunosuppressed nonhuman primates for many months or even more
than a year, consideration in carefully selected patients could be given to pig
kidney xenotransplantation. We suggest that, in order to give a patient the best 
possible outcome, the pig kidney could be transplanted pre-emptively (before
dialysis is initiated). If it fails at any stage, the patient would then begin
chronic dialysis and continue to await an allograft. The present (limited)
evidence is that failure of a pig graft would not be detrimental to a subsequent 
allograft.

Motor functions are deteriorated by aging. Some conditions may magnify this
deterioration. This study examined whether hemodialysis (HD) process would
negatively impact gait and balance beyond diabetes condition among mid-age adults
(48⁻64 years) and older adults (65+ years). One hundred and ninety-six subjects
(age = 66.2 ± 9.1 years, body-mass-index = 30.1 ± 6.4 kg/m², female = 56%) in 5
groups were recruited: mid-age adults with diabetes undergoing HD (Mid-age HD+, n
= 38) and without HD (Mid-age HD-, n = 40); older adults with diabetes undergoing
HD (Older HD+, n = 36) and without HD (Older HD-, n = 37); and non-diabetic older
adults (Older DM-, n = 45). Gait parameters (stride velocity, stride length, gait
cycle time, and double support) and balance parameters (ankle, hip, and center of
mass sways) were quantified using validated wearable platforms. Groups with
diabetes had overall poorer gait and balance compared to the non-diabetic group
(p < 0.050). Among people with diabetes, HD+ had significantly worsened gait and 
balance when comparing to HD- (Cohen's effect size d = 0.63⁻2.32, p < 0.050).
Between-group difference was more pronounced among older adults with the largest 
effect size observed for stride length (d = 2.32, p < 0.001). Results suggested
that deterioration in normalized gait speed among HD+ was negatively correlated
with age (r = -0.404, p < 0.001), while this correlation was diminished among
HD-. Interestingly, results also suggested that poor gait among Older HD- is
related to poor ankle stability, while no correlation was observed between poor
ankle stability and poor gait among Older HD+. Using objective assessments,
results confirmed that the presence of diabetes can deteriorate gait and balance,
and this deterioration can be magnified by HD process. Among HD- people with
diabetes, poor ankle stability described poor gait. However, among people with
diabetes undergoing HD, age was a dominate factor describing poor gait
irrespective of static balance. Results also suggested feasibility of using
wearable platforms to quantify motor performance during routine dialysis clinic
visit. These objective assessments may assist in identifying early deterioration 
in motor function, which in turn may promote timely intervention.

This study investigated geographical variations of access to renal
transplantation using three outcomes (access to the transplant waiting list,
access to renal transplantation after waitlisting and access to renal
transplantation after dialysis start). Associations of patient-related and
regional variables with the studied outcomes were assessed using a Cox shared
frailty model and a Fine and Gray model. At the study endpoint (December 31,
2015), 26.3% of all 18-90-year-old patients who started dialysis in the 22
mainland and four overseas French regions in 2012 (n = 9312) were waitlisted and 
15.1% received a kidney transplant. The geographical disparities of access to
renal transplantation varied according to the studied outcome. Patients from the 
Ile-de-France region had the highest probability of being waitlisted, but were
less likely to receive a kidney transplant. Two regional factors were associated 
with the access to the waiting list and to renal transplantation from dialysis
start: the incidence of preemptive kidney transplantation and of ESRD. The use of
different outcomes to evaluate access to kidney transplantation could help
healthcare policy-makers to select the most appropriate interventions for each
region in order to reduce treatment disparities.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 2% to 4% of patients with
severe aortic stenosis. It is because these patients have been excluded from
clinical trials, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in 
this patient group has not been thoroughly investigated. Between April 2008 and
March 2015, 2,000 patients (dialysis group, n = 56 [2.8%]) were consecutively
enrolled when diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and eligible to undergo TAVI.
Procedural and longer-term outcomes were analyzed and adjusted for differences in
baseline characteristics. Patients on dialysis had a higher periprocedural
mortality (10.7% vs 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 5.65, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.91 to 16.67; p = 0.002) and a lower Valve Academic Research
Consortium (VARC)-II (VARC) defined device success (adjOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to
0.79; p = 0.012). At 30 days, there was an increased rate of all-cause mortality 
(21.4 vs 4.8%; adjOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.96 to 12.26; p = 0.001), cardiovascular
(adjOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.41; p = 0.007) and noncardiovascular mortality
(adjOR 6.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 9.41; p = 0.019), myocardial infarction (adjOR 9.39, 
95% CI 1.84 to 48.03; p = 0.007), bleeding (adjOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.83;
p = 0.036) as well as the VARC-II defined early safety combined end point (adjOR 
2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.90; p = 0.012) associated with dialysis. Dialysis was
associated with poor survival at one (57.1% vs 84.2%) and 3 years (26.8% vs
66.9%) with or without the consideration of the first 72 hours (p <0.001;
adjusted p <0.001). Although, in the multivariable regression analysis, reduced
ejection fraction, peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH),
frailty and dialysis were associated with 1-year mortality, only PH (>60 mm Hg)
remained significant in an analysis restricted to the dialysis patients (adjusted
hazard ratio 2.68; 95% CI 1.18 to 5.88; p = 0.018). PH had a sensitivity of
45.8%, a specificity of 81.3%, and a positive predictive value of 64.7%. In
conclusion, dialysis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who
underwent TAVI. Long-term mortality in dialysis patients appears to be largely
determined by the kidney disease and/or dialysis itself whereas VARC-II defined
complications are largely unaffected. An increased short-term mortality still
calls for (pre-) procedural optimization.

As the population ages, surgical decision-making in vascular surgery has become
more complex. Older patients may not have been offered vascular surgical
intervention in the past because of prohibitive physiologic demands and poor
health. Patients now have more aggressive management of vascular risk factors
with medications, such as statin therapy, and less invasive endovascular or
hybrid treatment options. Outcomes in elderly patients may not be comparable with
younger patients for entities such as aortic aneurysm repair, carotid
endarterectomy, or lower extremity revascularization. Despite this, desirable
outcomes can be successfully achieved and should be offered to carefully selected
elderly individuals.

AIM: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been
diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty,
but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with
frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study
to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic
hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited.
Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered
diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not
(Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the
prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined
the risk factors for frailty.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than 
that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the
association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients
(n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their
interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic
nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic
nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18:

Under normal conditions, inflammation is a protective and physiological response 
to various harmful stimuli. However, in several chronic debilitating disorders,
such as chronic kidney disease, inflammation becomes maladaptive, uncontrolled
and persistent. Systemic persistent inflammation has, for almost 20 years, been
recognized as a major contributor to the uraemic phenotype (such as
cardiovascular disease, protein energy wasting, depression, osteoporosis and
frailty), and a predictor of cardiovascular and total mortality. Since
inflammation is mechanistically related to several ageing processes
(inflammageing), it may be a major driver of a progeric phenotype in the uraemic 
milieu. Inflammation is likely the consequence of a multifactorial aetiology and 
interacts with a number of factors that emerge when uraemic toxins accumulate.
Beside interventions aiming to decrease the production of inflammatory molecules 
in the uraemic milieu, novel strategies to increase the removal of large middle
molecules, such as expanded haemodialysis, may be an opportunity to decrease the 
inflammatory allostatic load associated with retention of middle molecular weight
uraemic toxins.

Background: Frail obese community-dwelling older adults are at increased
mortality risk. Among hemodialysis (HD) patients, frailty is common and
associated with increased mortality risk; however, in dialysis, obesity is
associated with decreased mortality risk. Whether the frail-obese phenotype is
associated with increased mortality risk among HD patients remains unclear.
Methods: This study included 370 incident HD patients enrolled in the Predictors 
of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End Stage Renal Disease (PACE) study. We
measured frailty using the Fried phenotype, general obesity [body mass index
(BMI) ≥30 kg/m2] and abdominal obesity [waist:hip ratio (WHR) ≥median WHR] and
estimated their associations with mortality.
Results: The mean age was 55 years, with 42% female, 73% African American, 57%
diabetic and 52% frail. Frail HD patients had higher mean BMI
(frail = 30.3 kg/m2, non-frail = 28.3 kg/m2; P = 0.02) and similar WHR (P = 0.8).
Twenty-two percent were frail with general obesity and 27% were frail with
abdominal obesity. Frailty was associated with 1.66-fold increased mortality risk
[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.67]. BMI was associated with a decreased
mortality risk [25.0-29.9 kg/m2 hazard ratio (HR) 0.53 (95% CI 0.31-0.93);
≥30 kg/m2 HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.19-0.62)]. Frailty was associated with elevated
mortality risk among HD patients with general [HR 3.77 (95% CI 1.10-12.92)] and
abdominal obesity [HR 2.38 (95% CI 1.17-4.82)]. Frailty was not associated with
mortality among HD patients without general or abdominal obesity.
Conclusions: In adults initiating HD, frailty was associated with elevated
mortality risk, even among the obese. Frail-obese HD patients may be a high-risk,
often-overlooked population, as obesity is assumed to be protective. Measurement 
of frailty and obesity may facilitate risk stratification.

Purpose: Recent evidence supports the prognostic significance of frailty for
functional decline and poor health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney
disease. Yet, despite the development of clinical tools to screen for frailty,
little is known about the experiential impact of screening for frailty in this
setting. The Frailty Assessment for Care Planning Tool (FACT) evaluates frailty
across 4 domains: mobility, function, social circumstances, and cognition. The
purpose of this qualitative study was as follows: 1) explore the nurse experience
of screening for frailty using the FACT tool in a specialized outpatient renal
clinic; 2) determine how, if at all, provider perceptions of frailty changed
after implementation of the frailty screening tool; and 3) determine the
perceived factors that influence uptake and administration of the FACT screening 
tool in a specialized clinical setting.
Methods: A semi-structured interview of 5 nurses from the Nova Scotia Health
Authority, Central Zone Renal Clinic was conducted. A grounded theory approach
was used to generate thematic categories and analysis models.
Results: Four primary themes emerged in the data analysis: "we were skeptical",
"we made it work", "we learned how", and "we understand". As the renal nurses
gained a sense of confidence in their ability to implement the FACT tool, initial
barriers to implementation were attenuated. Implementation factors - such as
realistic goals, clear guidelines, and ongoing training - were important factors 
for successful uptake of the frailty screening initiative.
Conclusion: Nurse participants reported an overall positive experience using the 
FACT method to screen for frailty and indicated that their understanding of the
multiple dimensions and subtleties of "frailty" were enhanced. Future nurse-led
FACT screening initiatives should incorporate those factors identified as being
integral to program success: realistic goals, clear guidelines, and ongoing
training. Adopting the evaluation of frailty as a priority within clinical
departments will encourage sustainability.

BACKGROUND: Among community-dwelling older adults, frailty is associated with
heightened markers of inflammation and subsequent mortality. Although frailty is 
common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, the role of frailty and
markers of inflammation in this population remains unclear. We quantified these
associations in patients on the kidney transplant waitlist and tested whether
frailty and/or markers of inflammation improve waitlist mortality risk
prediction.
METHODS: We studied 1975 ESRD patients on the kidney transplant waitlist
(November 1, 2009, to February 28, 2017) in a multi-center cohort study of
frailty. Serum inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 [IL-6], soluble tumor necrosis
factor-α receptor-1 [sTNFR1], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were analyzed in 605 
of these participants; we calculated the inflammatory index score using IL-6 and 
sTNFR1. We compared the C-statistic of an established registry-based prediction
model for waitlist mortality adding frailty and/or inflammatory markers (1 SD
change in log IL-6, sTNFR1, CRP, or inflammatory index).
RESULTS: The registry-based model had moderate predictive ability (c-statistic = 
0.655). Frailty was associated with increased mortality (2.19; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.26-3.79) but did not improve risk prediction (c-statistic =
0.646; P = 0.65). Like frailty, IL-6 (2.13; 95% CI, 1.41-3.22), sTNFR1 (1.70; 95%
CI, 1.12-2.59), CRP (1.68; 95% CI, 1.06-2.67), and the inflammatory index (2.09; 
95% CI, 1.38-3.16) were associated with increased mortality risk; unlike frailty,
adding IL-6 (c-statistic = 0.777; P = 0.02), CRP (c-statistic = 0.728; P = 0.02),
or inflammatory index (c-statistic = 0.777; P = 0.02) substantially improved
mortality risk prediction.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty and markers of inflammation were associated with increased
waitlist mortality risk, but only markers of inflammation significantly improved 
ESRD risk prediction. These findings help clarify the accelerated aging
physiology of ESRD and highlight easy-to-measure markers of increased waitlist
mortality risk.

Many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease have 
unmet palliative care (PC) needs. Physical and emotional symptoms are common.
Some, like uremia and fluid overload, improve with dialysis, but the increasing
age of patients initiating renal replacement therapy leaves many untreatable
comorbidities like dementia and frailty to negatively impact quality of life.
Written by nephrologists and PC clinicians, this article will help PC providers
to have a richer understanding of kidney disease-related symptom burden, disease 
trajectory, prognosis, and barriers to hospice enrollment for patients with CKD
and end-stage renal disease.

The number of elderly people has increased considerably over the last decades,
due to a rising life expectancy and ageing populations. As a result, an increased
number of elderly with end-stage-renal-disease are diagnosed, for which the
preferred treatment is renal transplantation. Over the past years the awareness
of the elderly as a specific patient population has grown, which increases the
importance of research in this group. Elderly patients often receive kidneys from
elderly donors while younger donor kidneys are preferentially reserved for
younger recipients. Although the rate of acute rejection after transplantation is
lower in the elderly, these rejections may lead to graft loss more frequently, as
kidneys from elderly donors have marginal reserve capacity. To prevent acute
rejection, immunosuppressive therapy is needed. On the other hand, elderly
patients have a higher risk to die from infectious complications, and thus less
immunosuppression would be preferable. Immunosuppressive treatment in the elderly
is complicated further by changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
with increasing age. Adjustments in standard immunosuppressive regimes are
therefore suggested for this population. An unmet need in transplantation
medicine is a tool to guide a personalized approach to immunosuppression.
Recently several promising biomarkers that identify injury to the graft at an
early stage or predict acute rejection have been identified. Unfortunately, none 
of these biomarkers were tested specifically in the elderly. We believe there is 
an urgent need to perform clinical trials investigating novel immunosuppressive
regimens in conjunction with biomarker studies in this specific population.

BACKGROUND: The Fried frailty phenotype, a measure of physiologic reserve defined
by 5 components (exhaustion, unintentional weight loss, low physical activity,
slow walking speed, and poor grip strength), is associated with poor outcomes
among ESRD patients. However, these 5 components may not fully capture
physiologic reserve in this population. We aimed to ascertain opinions of ESRD
clinicians and patients about the usefulness of the Fried frailty phenotype and
interventions to improve frailty in ESRD patients, and to identify novel
components to further characterize frailty in ESRD.
METHODS: Clinicians who treat adults with ESRD completed a 2-round Delphi study
(n = 41 and n = 36, respectively; response rate = 87%). ESRD patients completed a
survey at transplant evaluation (n = 460; response rate = 81%). We compared
clinician and patient opinions on the constituent components of frailty.
RESULTS: Clinicians were more likely than patients to say that ESRD makes
patients frail (97.6% vs. 60.2%). There was consensus among clinicians that
exhaustion, low physical activity, slow walking speed, and poor grip strength
characterize frailty in ESRD patients; however, 29% of clinicians thought weight 
loss was not relevant. Patients were less likely than clinicians to say that the 
5 Fried frailty components were relevant. Clinicians identified 10 new
ESRD-specific potential components including falls (64%), physical decline (61%),
and cognitive impairment (39%). Clinicians (83%) and patients (80%) agreed that
intradialytic foot-peddlers might make ESRD patients less frail.
CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus among clinicians and moderate consensus among
patients that frailty is more common in ESRD. Weight loss was not seen as
relevant, but new components were identified. These findings are first steps in
refining the frailty phenotype and identifying interventions to improve
physiologic reserve specific to ESRD patients.

Background: Frailty can be defined as an inflammatory state with a loss of
physiologic reserve in multiple systems that manifests as a decreased ability to 
respond to stressors that ultimately leads to an increased risk of adverse
outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the ease of frailty testing in a
pre-kidney transplant clinic and the resources required to do so. A secondary
goal was to better understand the utility of frailty testing when evaluating
potential kidney transplant recipients.
Methods: Frailty testing was conducted at a pre-kidney transplant clinic in three
phases using Fried's frailty phenotype (shrinking, exhaustion, low physical
activity, slowness, and grip strength).
Results: A total of 132 frailty tests were completed on 128 patients. Frail
patients had significantly higher rates of shrinking (26% vs. 8.5%, P < 0.05),
exhaustion (82.6% vs. 27.6%, P < 0.05), low physical activity (78.2% vs. 19.0%, P
< 0.05), slow walking (60.8% vs. 15.2%, P < 0.05), and grip strength (73.9% vs.
25.7%, P < 0.05). When comparing the listing of frail and non-frail patients for 
transplant, a significantly lower proportion of frail patients were listed
compared to non-frail patients (30.4% vs. 57.6%, P < 0.05). Frailty testing was
most complete when an examiner dedicated to frailty testing performed the
testing.
Conclusions: Frailty testing is feasible to complete in a pre-transplant clinic
with an appropriate investment in personnel and resources.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. However,
apart from its influence on cognition, it is currently unknown whether frailty
affects subtler cerebral function in patients with ESRD.
METHODS: Patients with ESRD were prospectively enrolled, with clinical features
and laboratory data recorded. The severity of frailty among these patients with
ESRD was ascertained using the previously validated simple FRAIL scale, and was
categorized as none-to-mild and moderate-to-severe frailty. All participants
underwent quantitative electroencephalography (EEG), with band powers documented 
following the generation of the delta to alpha ratio (DAR) and delta/theta to
alpha/beta ratio (DTABR). EEG results were then compared between groups of
different levels of frailty.
RESULTS: In this cohort, (mean age: 68.9 ± 10.4 years, 37% male, 3.4 ± 3 years of
dialysis), 20, 60, 40, 17, and 6% patients exhibited positivity in the fatigue,
resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss-of-body-weight domains, respectively,
with 45.7% being none to mildly frail and 54.3% being moderately to severely
frail. Those with mild frailty had a significantly higher delta power compared to
those with more severe frailty, involving all topographic sites. Patients with
ESRD and severe frailty had significantly lower global, left frontal, left
temporo-occipital, and right temporo-occipital DAR and DTABR, except in the right
frontal area, and tended to have central accentuation of alpha, beta, and theta
power, and more homogeneous DTABR and DAR distribution compared to the findings
in those with mild frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in patients with ESRD can have subtler neurophysiological
influences, presenting as altered EEG findings, which warrant our attention.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty among the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population is highly 
prevalent and has been associated with mortality. Little is known about the
relation of different aspects of body composition, a modifiable risk factor, with
the risk of frailty in ESRD population.
DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-one patients including 85 men and 66
women, aged ≥18 years with ESRD who had been receiving conventional maintenance
hemodialysis (HD) for at least 3 months were included. Body fat and muscle mass
from both bioimpedance spectroscopy and skin-fold thickness and waist
circumference as a surrogate of abdominal obesity were measured. Frailty was
defined based on Fried's criteria. Health-related quality of life was collected
using the RAND version of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36) Survey.
RESULTS: We performed single and multiple predictor logistic regression analyses 
to determine factors associated with frailty. After adjustment for age, sex, and 
comorbidities, fat mass (both by bioimpedance spectroscopy and anthropometry) and
waist circumference, but not muscle mass remained the main predictors of frailty.
The odds ratio of frailty in the third tertile compared with the first was 4.97
(1.70-14.55) and 3.84 (1.39-10.61) for fat mass and waist circumference,
respectively (P for trends for both <.05). The scores of physical health and
kidney disease effect component of quality of life were lower in frail compared
with nonfrail patients (40.7 ± 9.2 vs. 33.7 ± 10.2, P < .01 and 66.8 ± 22.4 vs.
51.6 ± 25.7, P < .05 for physical health and effects of disease, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, which is associated with poor outcomes in chronic HD
patients, is common and predicted by fat mass and waist circumference but not by 
body mass index and muscle mass. Interventions to modify abdominal obesity,
reflected by waist circumference, could potentially lower the incidence of
frailty and hence improve the quality of life in the HD population.

BACKGROUND: Although individuals classified as nonresident aliens, including
undocumented immigrants, are entitled to receive emergency dialysis in the United
States regardless of their ability to pay, most states do not provide them with
subsidized care for maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation. We explored
whether nonresident aliens have similar outcomes to US citizens after receiving
kidney transplants covered by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health
insurance program.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adult Medicaid patients in the US Renal Data System
who received their first kidney transplant from 1990 to 2011.
PREDICTOR: Citizenship status, categorized as US citizen, nonresident alien, or
permanent resident.
OUTCOME: All-cause transplant loss.
MEASUREMENTS: HRs and 95% CIs estimated by applying Cox proportional hazards
frailty models with transplantation center as a random effect.
RESULTS: Of 10,495 patients, 8,660 (82%) were US citizens, 1,489 (14%) were
permanent residents, and 346 (3%) were nonresident aliens, whom we assumed were
undocumented immigrants. Nonresident aliens were younger, healthier, receiving
dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a living donor. 71% underwent
transplantation in California, and 61% underwent transplantation after 2005.
Nonresident aliens had a lower unadjusted risk for transplant loss compared with 
US citizens (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still
significant when adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, dialysis, and
transplant-related factors (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94).
LIMITATIONS: Citizenship status was self-reported, possible residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the select group of insured nonresident
aliens who undergo transplantation with Medicaid do just as well as US citizens
with Medicaid. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for kidney
transplantation in nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, given
the associated high-quality outcomes in these patients.

Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reflects a patient's disease
burden, treatment effectiveness, and health status and is summarized by physical,
mental, and kidney disease-specific scales among end-stage renal disease
patients. Although on average HRQOL improves postkidney transplant (KT), the
degree of change depends on the ability of the patient to withstand the stressor 
of dialysis versus the ability to tolerate the intense physiologic changes of KT.
Frail KT recipients may be extra vulnerable to either of these stressors, thus
affecting change in HRQOL after KT.
METHODS: We ascertained frailty, as well as physical, mental, and kidney
disease-specific HRQOL in a multicenter prospective cohort of 443 KT recipients
(May 2014 to May 2017) using Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short
Form. We quantified the short-term (3 months) rate of post-KT HRQOL change by
frailty status using adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models.
RESULTS: Mean HRQOL scores at KT were 43.3 (SD, 9.6) for physical, 52.8 (SD, 8.9)
for mental, and 72.6 (SD, 12.8) for kidney disease-specific HRQOL; frail
recipients had worse physical (P < 0.001) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (P = 
0.001), but similar mental HRQOL (P = 0.43). Frail recipients experienced
significantly greater rates of improvement in physical HRQOL (frail, 1.35
points/month; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-2.05; nonfrail, 0.34
points/month; 95% CI, -0.17-0.85; P = 0.02) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL
(frail, 3.75 points/month; 95% CI, 2.89-4.60; nonfrail, 2.41 points/month; 95%
CI, 1.78-3.04; P = 0.01), but no difference in mental HRQOL (frail, 0.54
points/month; 95% CI, -0.17-1.25; nonfrail, 0.46 points/month; 95% CI,
-0.06-0.98; P = 0.85) post-KT.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite decreased physiologic reserve, frail recipients experience
improvement in post-KT physical and kidney disease-specific HRQOL better than
nonfrail recipients.

BACKGROUND: Frailty exhibits a high prevalence in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
patients and is associated with adverse health-related outcomes, including falls 
and fractures. Available studies do not address whether frailty is associated
with temporal changes in BMD. We evaluated this issue by analyzing the follow-up 
dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results in an ESRD cohort.
METHODS: In 2015, we enrolled forty-three ESRD patients, divided into frail,
pre-frail, and robust ones based on a validated simple FRAIL scale, all receiving
DXA at baseline. After one year of follow-up, survivors received another DXA, and
we calculated the absolute and percentage changes in area, bone mineral density
(BMD), T-, and Z-scores of lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN) between baseline
and follow-up examinations.
RESULTS: Among all, frail individuals with ESRD had significantly lower average
lumbar spine area, lower L4, FN, and total BMD and T-scores, lower FN and total
Z-scores than non-frail ones, without differences in gender, body mass index,
dialysis duration, and comorbidities. Furthermore, we discovered frail ESRD
patients had significantly more prominent decrease in average lumbar spine area, 
percentage changes in L1 Z-scores and average lumbar spine area, and a trend
toward more prominent decrease in L4 area than non-frail ones after one year of
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline frailty might be associated with deteriorating bone health,
including shrinking L-spine areas and a more rapid decrease in L-spine Z scores, 
among ESRD patients. This frailty-bone association should be highlighted during
our care of frail individuals with ESRD.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

It is often of interest to compare centers or healthcare providers on quality of 
care delivered. We consider the setting where evaluation of center performance on
multiple competing events is of interest. We propose estimating center effects
through cause-specific proportional hazards frailty models that allow correlation
among a center's cause-specific effects. Estimation of our model proceeds via
penalized partial likelihood and is implemented in R. To evaluate center
performance, we also propose a directly standardized excess cumulative incidence 
(ECI) measure. Therefore, based on our proposed methods, practitioners can
evaluate centers either through the cause-specific hazards or the cumulative
incidence functions. We demonstrate, through simulations, the advantages of the
proposed methods to detect outlying centers, by comparing the proposed methods
and existing methods which assume uncorrelated random center effects. In
addition, we develop a Correlation Score Test to test the null hypothesis that
the competing event processes within a center are correlated. Using data from the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we apply our method to evaluate the
performance of Organ Procurement Organizations on two competing risks: (i)
receipt of a kidney transplant and (ii) death on the wait-list.

BACKGROUND: Physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning are frequently
impaired in dialysis patients and impairment in these domains relates to poor
outcome. The aim of this analysis was to compare the prevalence of impairment as 
measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life- Short Form (KDQOL-SF) subscales
between the different age categories and to assess whether the association of
these subscales with mortality differs between younger and older dialysis
patients.
METHODS: This study included data from 714 prevalent hemodialysis patients, from 
26 centres, who were enrolled in the CONvective TRAnsport STudy (CONTRAST
NCT00205556, 09-12-2005). Baseline HRQOL domains were evaluated for patients
<65 years, 65-74 years and over 75 years. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
analyses were performed to assess the relation between the separate domains and
2-year mortality.
RESULTS: Emotional health was higher in patients over the age of 75 compared to
younger patients (mean level 71, 73 and 77 for increasing age categories
respectively, p = 0.02), whilst physical functioning was significantly lower in
older patients (mean level 60, 48 and 40, p < 0.01). A low level of physical
functioning (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.72 [95%Confidence Interval (CI) 1.02-2.73]),
emotional health (HR 1.85 [95% 1.30-2.63]), and social functioning (HR 1.59 [95% 
CI 1.12-2.26]), was individually associated with an increased 2-year mortality
within the whole population. The absence of effect modification suggests no
evidence for different relations within the older age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In dialysis patients, older age is associated with lower levels of
physical functioning, whilst the level of emotional health is not associated with
age. KDQOL-SF domains physical functioning, emotional health and social
functioning are independently associated with mortality in prevalent younger and 
older hemodialysis patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and
associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in
frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we
examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of
Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in 
ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24
months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled
frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during
follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of
frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores
changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change,
0.2 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity
(0.6 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7
points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher
frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores
(-1.1 points per g/dl; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition,
patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become
frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction
in frailty score (95% confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the
underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included
serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of
hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and
hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at
any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic
rate was not independently associated with frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores,
with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of 
inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening
frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or 
posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.

Many patients become frail with diminished cardiorespiratory fitness while
awaiting kidney transplantation. Frailty and poor fitness powerfully predict
mortality, transplant graft survival, and healthcare utilization after kidney
transplantation. Efforts to intervene with post-transplant physical therapy have 
been met with limited success, in large part due to high study dropout. We
reviewed the literature on chronic kidney disease and exercise to propose a
clinical framework for physical therapy interventions to improve fitness,
scheduled for before the transplant. This framework may lead to better patient
retention and compliance, and thus demonstrate better efficacy in mitigating the 
effects of frailty and poor fitness after kidney transplantation.

Frailty is a common complication in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) under dialysis, which is a strong risk factor for low quality of life,
morbidity, and mortality. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of
frailty in a group of Portuguese ESRD patients, and its association with
socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. We performed a
cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3
[±14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients
as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire.
Social support, data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and
haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory
markers were also evaluated. Our results confirmed that frailty is a highly
prevalent condition in ESRD patients, particularly in female patients. An
association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of
hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis and
is traditionally measured using tools that assess physical impairment. Alternate 
measurement tools highlight cognitive and functional domains, requiring
clinician, patient, and/or caregiver input. In this study, we compared frailty
measures for incident dialysis patients that incorporate patient, clinician, and 
caregiver perspectives with an aim to contrast the measured prevalence of frailty
using tools derived from different conceptual frameworks.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients was conducted
between February 2014 and June 2015. Frailty was assessed at dialysis onset
using: 1) modified definition of Fried Phenotype (Dialysis Morbidity Mortality
Study definition, DMMS); 2) Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS); 3) Frailty Assessment
Care Planning Tool (provides CFS grading, FACT-CFS); and 4) Frailty Index (FI).
Measures were compared via correlation and sensitivity/specificity analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 98 patients participated (mean age of 61 ± 14 years).
Participants were primarily Caucasian (91%), male (58%), and the majority started
on hemodialysis (83%). The median score for both the CFS and FACT-CFS was 4
(interquartile range of 3-5). The mean FI score was 0.31 (standard
deviation ± 0.16). The DMMS identified 78% of patients as frail. The FACT-CFS
demonstrated highest correlation (r = 0.71) with the FI, while the DMMS was most 
sensitive (97%, 100%) and a CFS ≥ 5 most specific (100%, 77%) at corresponding FI
cutoff values (>0.21, >0.45).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessments of incident dialysis patients that include
clinician, caregiver and patient perspectives have moderate to strong correlation
with the FI. At specified FI cutoff values, the FACT-CFS and DMMS are highly
sensitive measures of frailty. The CFS and FACT-CFS may represent viable
alternative screening tools in dialysis patients.

Frailty is a distinct phenotype that is highly prevalent in chronic kidney
disease (CKD) and appears to be more prevalent with decreasing glomerular
filtration rate. Exercise training or intervention to increase physical activity 
may ameliorate poor physical functioning and frailty, and even may improve
survival in patients with CKD. Although exercise interventions improve outcomes
across the spectrum of CKD, including patients treated with dialysis, patients
treated with dialysis face barriers to exercise that patients with predialysis
CKD do not. Rehabilitation at earlier stages of CKD (or prehabilitation before
dialysis) might be more beneficial than not addressing the decreasing physical
functioning and low physical activity until patients are receiving dialysis. This
review summarizes available literature on frailty in the CKD and end-stage renal 
disease population, including exercise interventions and the limited evidence for
prehabilitation as a strategy.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review and
meta-analysis on prevalence of frailty among patients with end-stage renal
disease (ESRD). ESRD is associated with malnutrition, chronic inflammation,
acidemia, impaired hormonal changes, and low physical activity, all of which can 
directly and indirectly contribute to the development of frailty. Coexistence of 
ESRD and frailty has been shown to increase risks of adverse health outcomes.
Given potential reversibility of frailty, it is important to examine frailty
status in this high-risk population.
METHODS: Three databases (EMBASE, Medline, and CINAHL) were systematically
searched for studies providing cross-sectional data of prevalence of frailty
defined by cardiovascular health study (CHS) criteria among ESRD patients.
Meta-analysis calculated pooled prevalence of frailty according to modifications 
of CHS criteria.
RESULTS: Of 837 studies identified through the systematic review, seven studies
were included. Three studies used both objectively measured and self-reported CHS
criteria, and two studies each used only either criteria. Pooled prevalence of
frailty was 36.8% (five studies: 95% CI = 29.9-44.1%, I 2 = 82.6%, p < 0.001) and
67.0% (five studies: 95% CI = 58.7-74.7%, I 2 = 96.5%, p < 0.001) according to
the objectively measured and self-reported CHS criteria, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of ESRD patients were frail based on the
objectively measured CHS criteria, and that prevalence of frailty almost doubled 
with the CHS criteria substituting self-reported physical function questionnaire 
score for objective measurements. Given substantial difference in prevalence of
frailty depending on the modifications to CHS criteria, this information should
be taken into account when evaluating frailty status among ESRD population.

Nursing home care. Daily HHD vs conventional dialysis: A survival comparison.

Yang A, Lee A, Hocking K.

Patients that dialyze in the nursing home setting are known to be an especially
at-risk vulnerable population compared to the overall ESRD population. This is
likely due to the nursing home dialysis patients' advanced age, multiple
co-morbidities, and frailty, requiring skilled nursing support. These challenges 
often result in worse outcomes compared to the overall end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) population but few studies have investigated interventions to improve
health outcomes in this population. Previously, we reported results from a study 
using a large epidemiological database of patients from an independent nursing
home dialysis provider, showing that patients treated with daily home
hemodialysis had improved outcomes compared to patients treated with conventional
dialysis. One limitation of the previous study was that the timeframe for the two
comparison groups was different; therefore, the results could have been due to
over-all improvements in care over time unrelated to the modality of dialysis: To
address this as well as expand on the previous analysis, the objective of the
present study was to compare outcomes in ESRD patients in the nursing home
setting treated with daily home hemodialysis versus con- ventional
three-day-a-week (TIW) hemodialysis using an updated database, specifically
assessing patients treated during a concurrent time: frame. Health status was
evaluated for 6,314 patients (n=4,778 conventional, n=1,902 daily home
hemodialysis; 2006 to November 2015 for conventional; 2011 to November 2015 for
daily home hemodialysis). Analyses included monthly mortality rates, Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis, and laboratory values. In the "Compared to the conventional
dialysis population, daily HHD patients had similar or lower incident mortality
rates." analysis of patients treated during the concurrent timeframe, median
overall survival was 36 months with daily home hemodialysis versus 21 months with
conventional dialysis (P=0.0025). These results were similar to the analysis of
all patients regardless of timeframe. Compared to the conventional dialysis
population, daily home hemodialysis patients had similar or lower incident
mortality rates. Survival rates were higher at 3 months (89% vs 82%), 6 months
(84% vs 73%), and 12 months (74% vs 62%) in the daily home hemodialy- sis
population compared to conventional dialysis population. Monthly mean albumin was
consistent over time in the daily home hemodialysis population but gradually
increased in the conventional dialysis population. Hemoglobin values were
consistently lower over the follow-up period in the daily home hemodialysis
population and ferritin values were similar in both populations. These results
confirm and extend previous findings that daily home hemodialysis is associated
with improved patient outcomes compared to conventional hemodialysis. Although
difficult to conduct practically, a prospective randomized outcomes study
evaluating daily home hemodialysis versus conventional TIW dialysis would be
valuable in informing the standard of dialysis care in this population.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical implications of frailty in chronic kidney 
disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and chronic peritoneal
dialysis.
DESIGN: In this prospective study, all of the participants completed the Short
Form of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, Korean version, to
determine their frailty phenotype. We also obtained blood chemistry and
demographic data at enrollment. Data regarding the history of hospitalization and
death were collected during the follow-up period.
SUBJECTS: We recruited 1,658 patients (1,255 maintenance hemodialysis and 403
chronic peritoneal dialysis) from multidialysis units (n = 27). We excluded
patients who had been hospitalized in the previous 3 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalization and survival rate during study period.
RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 55.2 ± 11.9 years old, and 55.2% were
male. Among the participants, 34.8% were rated as frail and 45.7% as prefrail.
Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant associations of frailty with age, 
comorbidity, disability, unemployment, higher body mass index, and a lower
educational level. During the follow-up period (median 17.1 months), 608 patients
(79 not frail, 250 prefrail, and 279 frail) were hospitalized, and 87 patients
(10 not frail, 24 prefrail, and 53 frail) died (P < .001). Frailty was associated
with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval:
1.38-2.36) and mortality (hazard ratio, 2.37, 95% confidence interval:
1.11-5.02).
CONCLUSION: The frailty phenotype was common even in, prevalent end-stage renal
disease patients on dialysis, and was significantly associated with higher rates 
of hospitalization and mortality.

The number of older end-stage renal disease patients being referred for kidney
transplantation continues to increase. This rise is occurring alongside the
continually increasing prevalence of older end-stage renal disease patients.
Although older kidney transplant recipients have decreased patient and graft
survival compared to younger patients, transplantation in this patient population
is pursued due to the survival advantage that it confers over remaining on the
deceased donor waiting list. The upper limit of age and the extent of comorbidity
and frailty at which transplantation ceases to be advantageous is not known.
Transplant physicians are therefore faced with the challenge of determining who
among older patients are appropriate candidates for kidney transplantation. This 
is usually achieved by means of an organ systems-based medical evaluation with
particular focus given to cardiovascular health. More recently, global measures
of health such as functional status and frailty are increasingly being recognized
as potential tools in risk stratifying kidney transplant candidates. For those
candidates who are deemed eligible, living donor transplantation should be
pursued. This may mean accepting a kidney from an older living donor. In the
absence of any living donor, the choice to accept lesser quality kidneys should
be made while taking into account the organ shortage and expected waiting times
on the deceased donor list. Appropriate counseling of patients should be a
cornerstone in the evaluation process and includes a discussion regarding
expected outcomes, expected waiting times in the setting of the new Kidney
Allocation System, benefits of living donor transplantation and the acceptance of
lesser quality kidneys.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

PURPOSE: Although a population's senescence rate is classically measured as the
increase in mortality rate with age on a logarithmic scale, it may be more
accurately measured as the increase on a linear scale. Patients on dialysis, who 
suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality
rate on a logarithmic scale, but a larger increase on a linear scale than
patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be
biased by population heterogeneity.
METHODS: Follow-up data on 323,308 patients on dialysis and 91,679 patients with 
a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We
measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models
that allow individual variation in this increase.
RESULTS: According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase 
in mortality rate on a logarithmic scale was smaller in patients on dialysis,
while the senescence rate measured as the increase on a linear scale was larger
in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant.
CONCLUSIONS: Also when accounting for population heterogeneity, a population's
senescence rate is more accurately measured as the increase in mortality rate on 
a linear scale than a logarithmic scale.

BACKGROUND: Numerous frailty screening instruments are available, but their
applicability for identifying frailty in patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) is unknown. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of three
instruments used for frailty screening in an ESRD population.
METHODS: The study was conducted in 2013 in a teaching hospital in The
Netherlands and included patients receiving haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis
and pre-dialysis care. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of three
screening instruments: the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), the Identification 
of Seniors at Risk-Hospitalized Patients (ISAR-HP) and the
Veiligheidsmanagementsysteem (VMS), which is a safety management system for
vulnerable elderly patients. The Frailty Index was the gold standard used.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty was 37% in a total of 95 participants with
ESRD [mean age 65.2 years (SD 12.0), 57% male]. Frailty prevalence in
participants ≥65 years of age and <65 years of age was 44% and 28%, respectively 
(P = 0.11). Sensitivity and specificity for frailty of the GFI were 89% and 57%, 
respectively; ISAR-HP 83% and 77%, respectively; and VMS 77% and 67%,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the GFI showed the highest sensitivity, it is not yet
possible to propose a firm choice for one of these screening instruments or
specific items due to the small scale of the study. Since there is a high
prevalence of frailty in ESRD patients, translation and testing of the
effectiveness of screening using the GFI in the prognostication and prevention of
development or deterioration of frailty in this population should be the next
step.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent in the United States and
throughout the world,(1) with approximately 13% of adults affected.(2) In
addition, according to recent estimates, almost half of patients with CKD stages 
3 to 5 are 70 years of age and older.(2) In the United States, the number of
prevalent end-stage renal disease cases continues to increase in patients older
than age 65. In light of the demographic characteristics of patients with CKD and
ESRD, there has been considerable focus on associations between CKD and
cardiovascular outcomes.(3) Until recently, less attention had been paid to other
consequences of CKD in general and among older individuals with CKD in
particular, but there is now solid evidence linking CKD with impairments of
physical function, cognitive function, and emotional function and quality of
life. This review summarizes available literature on these topics, focusing
specifically on physical functioning and frailty, cognitive function, emotional
health, including depression and anxiety, and health-related quality of life.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem that is associated
with excess morbidity, mortality, and health resource utilization. The
progression of CKD is defined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and
leads to a variety of metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypertension,
anemia, and mineral bone disorder. Lower glomerular filtration rate also bears a 
strong relationship with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, end-stage
renal disease, and death. Patterns of CKD progression include linear and
nonlinear trajectories, but kidney function can remain stable for years in some
individuals. Addressing modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD is
needed to attenuate its associated morbidity and mortality. Developing effective 
risk prediction models for CKD progression is critical to identify patients who
are more likely to benefit from interventions and more intensive monitoring.
Accurate risk-prediction algorithms permit systems to best align health care
resources with risk to maximize their effects and efficiency while guiding
overall decision making.

During the last 20 years, waiting lists for renal transplantation (RT) have grown
significantly older. However, elderly patients (ie ≥65 years of age) are still
more rarely referred or accepted to waiting lists and, if enlisted, have less
chances of actually receiving a kidney allograft, than younger counterparts. In
this review, we looked at evidence for the benefits and risks of RT in the
elderly trying to answer the following questions: Should RT be advocated for
elderly patients? What should be the criteria to accept elderly patients on the
waiting list for RT? What strategies might be used to increase the rate of RT in 
waitlisted elderly candidates? For selected elderly patients, RT was shown to be 
superior to dialysis in terms of patient survival. Virtually all guidelines
recommend that patients should not be deemed ineligible for RT based on age
alone, although a short life expectancy generally might preclude RT. Concerning
the assessment of comorbidities in the elderly, special attention should be paid 
to cardiac evaluation and screening for malignancy. Comorbidity scores and
frailty assessment scales might help the decision making on eligibility.
Psychosocial issues should also be evaluated. To overcome the scarcity of organ
donors, elderly RT candidates should be encouraged to consider expanded criteria 
donors and living donors, as alternatives to deceased standard criteria donors.
It has been demonstrated that expanded criteria donor RT in patients 60 years or 
older is associated with higher survival rates than remaining on dialysis,
whereas living donor RT is superior to all other options.

IMPORTANCE: Efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on
patients with cancer. High-quality end-of-life care is also critical for patients
with other illnesses.
OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of end-of-life care and family-rated quality of
care for patients dying with different serious illnesses.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was
conducted in all 146 inpatient facilities within the Veteran Affairs health
system among patients who died in inpatient facilities between October 1, 2009,
and September 30, 2012, with clinical diagnoses categorized as end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), cancer, cardiopulmonary failure (congestive heart failure or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), dementia, frailty, or other conditions.
Data analysis was conducted from April 1, 2014, to February 10, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Palliative care consultations, do-not-resuscitate
orders, death in inpatient hospices, death in the intensive care unit, and
family-reported quality of end-of-life care.
RESULTS: Among 57 753 decedents, approximately half of the patients with ESRD,
cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty received palliative care consultations
(adjusted proportions, 50.4%, 46.7%, and 43.7%, respectively) vs 73.5% of
patients with cancer and 61.4% of patients with dementia (P < .001).
Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or
frailty (adjusted proportions, 32.3%, 34.1%, and 35.2%, respectively) died in the
intensive care unit, more than double the rates among patients with cancer and
those with dementia (13.4% and 8.9%, respectively) (P < .001). Rates of excellent
quality of end-of-life care reported by 34 005 decedents' families were similar
for patients with cancer and those with dementia (adjusted proportions, 59.2% and
59.3%; P = .61), but lower for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or
frailty (54.8%, 54.8%, and 53.7%, respectively; all P ≤ .02 vs patients with
cancer). This quality advantage was mediated by palliative care consultation,
setting of death, and a code status of do-not-resuscitate; adjustment for these
variables rendered the association between diagnosis and overall end-of-life care
quality nonsignificant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Family-reported quality of end-of-life care was
significantly better for patients with cancer and those with dementia than for
patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty, largely owing to higher 
rates of palliative care consultation and do-not-resuscitate orders and fewer
deaths in the intensive care unit among patients with cancer and those with
dementia. Increasing access to palliative care and goals of care discussions that
address code status and preferred setting of death, particularly for patients
with end-organ failure and frailty, may improve the overall quality of
end-of-life care for Americans dying of these illnesses.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older patients reaching ESRD have a higher risk of
adverse health outcomes. We aimed to determine the association of functional and 
cognitive impairment and frailty with adverse health outcomes in patients
reaching ESRD. Understanding these associations could ultimately lead to
prediction models to guide tailored treatment decisions or preventive
interventions.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web
of Science, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and COCHRANE for original studies
published until February 8, 2016 reporting on the association of functional or
cognitive impairment or frailty with adverse health outcome after follow-up in
patients reaching ESRD either with or without RRT.
RESULTS: Of 7451 identified citations, we included 30 articles that reported on
35 associations. Mean age was >60 years old in 73% of the studies, and geriatric 
conditions were highly prevalent. Twenty-four studies (80%) reported on
functional impairment, seven (23%) reported on cognitive impairment, and four
(13%) reported on frailty. Mortality was the main outcome measure in 29 studies
(97%), and one study assessed functional status trajectory. In 34 of 35 (97%)
associations reported, functional or cognitive impairment or frailty was
significantly and independently associated with adverse health outcomes. The
majority of studies (83%) were conducted in selected patient populations, mainly 
patients on incident dialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional and cognitive impairment and frailty in patients reaching
ESRD are highly prevalent and strongly and independently associated with adverse 
health outcomes, and they may, therefore, be useful for risk stratification. More
research into their prognostic value is needed.

Background. Geriatric syndromes (GS) exhibit high prevalence in patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under chronic dialysis irrespective of age. We
sought to determine whether GS influences medication adherence in ESRD patients. 
Methods. A prospective cohort of chronic dialysis patients was assembled. The
presence of GS components, including frailty/prefrailty, polypharmacy, and
malnutrition, were ascertained through a validated questionnaire, electronic
records and chart abstraction, and laboratory tests. The severity of medication
non-adherence was defined using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale
(MMAS). Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed targeting MMAS
results and incorporating relevant clinical features and GS. Results. The
prevalence of frailty/pre-frailty, polypharmacy, and hypoalbuminemia/
malnutrition among the enrolled participants was 66.7%, 94%, and 14%,
respectively. The average MMAS scores in these dialysis patients were 2 ± 1.7
(range, 0-6), with only 15.7% exhibiting high medication adherence. Multiple
regression analyses showed that the absence of frailty/pre-frailty (P = 0.01)
were significantly associated with poorer medication adherence, while the
presence of polypharmacy (P = 0.02) and lower serum albumin, a potential sign of 
malnutrition (P = 0.03), were associated with poor adherence in another model.
Conclusion. This study is among the very few reports addressing GS and medication
adherence, especially in ESRD patients. Interventions targeting frailty,
polypharmacy, and malnutrition might potentially improve the medication
non-adherence and symptom control in these pill-burdened patients.

BACKGROUND: Patient-centered quality outcomes such as disposition after surgery
are increasingly being scrutinized. Preoperative factors predictive of nonhome
discharge (DC) may identify at-risk patients for targeted interventions. This
study examines the association among preoperative risk factors, frailty, and
nonhome DC after elective vascular surgery procedures in patients living at home.
METHODS: The 2011-2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was
queried to identify all home-dwelling patients who underwent elective vascular
procedures (endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair, suprainguinal and
infrainguinal bypasses, peripheral endovascular interventions, carotid
endarterectomy, and stent). Preoperative frailty was measured using the modified 
frailty index (mFI; derived from Canadian Study of Health and Aging). Univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the
association of frailty and nonhome DC.
RESULTS: Of 15,843 home-dwelling patients, 1,177 patients (7.4%) did not return
home postoperatively. Frailty (mFI > 0.25) conferred a significantly increased
2-fold risk of nonhome DC disposition for each procedure type. Frailty, female
gender, open procedures, increasing age, end-stage renal disease, and occurrence 
of any postoperative complication were associated with increased risk of nonhome 
DC. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, frailty increased the odds of
nonhome DC by 60% (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4-1.8) after
adjusting for other covariates. In the presence of complications, the risk of
nonhome DC was 27.5% in frail versus 16.5% in nonfrail patients (P < 0.001). In
the absence of complications, although absolute risk was lower, frail patients
were nearly twice as likely to not return home (frail 5.5% vs. nonfrail 2.75%,
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail home-dwelling patients undergoing elective vascular procedures
are at high risk of not returning home after surgery. Preoperative frailty
assessment appears to hold potential for counseling regarding postsurgery
disposition and DC planning.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

PURPOSE: Prognosis of the increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) is poor with high risk of functional decline and mortality. 
Frailty seems to be a good predictor for those patients that will not benefit
from dialysis. Varying prevalences between populations are probably related to
the instrument used. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of
frailty among ESRD patients with two different validated instruments.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients, aged ≥18 years,
receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis care between
September 2013 and December 2013 in a single dialysis center in Apeldoorn, the
Netherlands. Frailty was measured with the frailty index (FI) and frailty
phenotype (FP).
RESULTS: Prevalence of frailty by the FI was 36.8 % among 95 participants with
ESRD (age: 65.2 years, SD ± 12.0). Frailty prevalence among participants aged ≥65
and <65 years was 43.6 and 27.5 %, respectively. Female sex [odds ratio (OR) 3.3,
95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.3-8.0] and a Charlson comorbidity index score of 
≥5 (OR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.0-6.6) were associated with frailty. The FI identified
different but overlapping participants as frail compared with the FP; 62.5 % of
frail participants according to FI were also frail according to the FP.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of frailty among young and elderly ESRD patients is high;
being female and having more comorbidity was associated with frailty. Use of a
broader definition of frailty, like the FI, gives a higher estimation of
prevalence among ESRD patients compared with a physical frailty assessment.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With aging of the general population, patients who
enter dialysis therapy will more frequently have geriatric impairments and a
considerable comorbidity burden. The most vulnerable among these patients might
benefit from conservative therapy. Whether assessment of geriatric impairments
would contribute to the decision-making process of dialysis initiation is
unknown.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A systematic Medline and Embase
search was performed on December 1, 2015 to identify studies assessing the
association between risk of mortality or hospitalization and one or more
geriatric impairments at the start of dialysis therapy, including impairment of
cognitive function, mood, performance status or (instrumental) activities of
daily living, mobility (including falls), social environment, or nutritional
status.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were identified that assessed one or more geriatric
impairments with respect to prognosis. The quality of most studies was moderate. 
Only seven studies carried out an analysis of elderly patients (≥70 years old).
Malnutrition and frailty were systematically assessed, and their relation with
mortality was clear. In addition, cognitive impairment and functional outcomes at
the initiation of dialysis were related to an increased mortality in most
studies. However, not all studies applied systematic assessment tools, thereby
potentially missing relevant impairment. None of the studies applied a geriatric 
assessment across multiple domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric impairment across multiple domains at dialysis initiation 
is related to poor outcome. However, information in the elderly is sparse, and a 
systematic approach of multiple domains with respect to poor outcome has not been
performed. Because a geriatric assessment has proved useful in predicting outcome
in other medical fields, its potential role in the ESRD population should be the 
subject of future research.

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with
destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial
cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However,
surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis
rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on
hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal
kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree
decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior
instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to
adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical 
motion.

Background. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a high symptom
burden, among which fatigue is highly prevalent. Many fatigue-assessing
instruments exist, but comparisons among instruments in this patient population
have yet to be investigated. Methods. ESRD patients under chronic hemodialysis
were prospectively enrolled and seven types of fatigue instruments were
administered: Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Lee Fatigue
Scale (LFS), Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and
Short-Form 36-Vitality (SF36-V). Using these instruments, we investigated the
correlation between fatigue severity and clinical/biochemical parameters,
including demographic/comorbidity profile, dialysis-related complications, and
frailty severity. We used regression analysis with serum albumin and frailty
severity as the dependent variables to investigate the independent correlations. 
Results. A total of 46 ESRD patients were enrolled (average age of 67 ± 11.6
years), and 50% of them had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results from the seven
tested instruments showed high correlation with each other. We found that the
fatigue severity by FACIT-F was significantly associated with age (p = 0.03),
serum albumin (p = 0.003) and creatinine (p = 0.02) levels, while SF36-V scores
were also significantly associated with age (p = 0.02) and serum creatinine
levels (p = 0.04). However, the fatigue severity measured by the FSS, FSI, FQ,
BFI, and LFS did not exhibit these associations. Moreover, regression analysis
showed that only FACIT-F scores were independently associated with serum albumin 
levels and frailty severity in ESRD patients. Conclusion. Among the seven
fatigue-assessing instruments, only the FACIT-F yielded results that demonstrated
significant and independent associations with important outcome-related features 
in ESRD patients.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

Inequalities between genders in access to transplantation have been demonstrated.
We aimed to validate this gender inequality in a large pediatric population and
to investigate its causes. This cohort study included 6454 patients starting
renal replacement therapy before 18 years old, in 35 countries participating in
the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology/European Renal
Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry. We used
cumulative incidence competing risk and proportional hazards frailty models to
study the time to receive a transplant and hierarchical logistic regression to
investigate access to preemptive transplantation. Girls had a slower access to
renal transplantation because of a 23% lower probability of receiving preemptive 
transplantation. We found a longer follow-up time before renal replacement
therapy in boys compared with girls despite a similar estimated glomerular
filtration rate at first appointment. Girls tend to progress faster toward
end-stage renal disease than boys, which may contribute to a shorter time
available for pretransplantation workup. Overall, medical factors explained only 
70% of the gender difference. In Europe, girls have less access to preemptive
transplantation for reasons that are only partially related to medical factors.
Nonmedical factors such as patient motivation and parent and physician attitudes 
toward transplantation and organ donation may contribute to this inequality. Our 
study should raise awareness for the management of girls with renal diseases.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with worse health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) in older adults and worse clinical outcomes in adults of all ages with
end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is unclear whether frail adults of all ages
with ESRD are more likely to experience worse HRQOL. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this 
study was to identify factors associated with worsening HRQOL in this population.
DESIGN, SETTING AND MEASUREMENTS: We studied 233 adults of all ages with ESRD
enrolled (11/2009-11/2013) in a longitudinal cohort study. Frailty status was
measured at enrollment and HRQOL was reported (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair
or Poor) at the initial assessment and follow-up (median follow-up 9.4 months).
We studied factors associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up using logistic
regression and factors associated with HRQOL change using multinomial regression.
All models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, BMI, diabetes status,
history of a previous transplant, type of dialysis and time between assessments. 
RESULTS: Fair/Poor HRQOL was reported by 28% at initial assessment and 33% at
follow-up. 47.2% of participants had stable HRQOL, 22.8% better HRQOL, and 30.0% 
worse HRQOL at follow-up (P<0.001). In adjusted models, only frailty was
associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up (OR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.32-5.90) and
worsening HRQOL at follow-up (RR: 2.91, 95%CI: 1.08-7.80). CONCLUSIONS: Frail
adults of all ages with ESRD are more likely to experience fair/poor HRQOL and
worsening HRQOL over time. Frailty represents a state of decreased physiologic
reserve that impacts not only clinical outcomes but also the patient-centered
outcome of HRQOL.

BACKGROUND: The dialysis population is aging worldwide. It is well known that
patients on dialysis have limited functional status, but only recently has
frailty been considered.
SUMMARY: The prevalence of frailty among patients on dialysis ranges from 3.4- to
10-fold higher than among community-dwelling elderly, depending on the method of 
assessing frailty and patient characteristics. Despite its high prevalence and
the high overall mortality in the dialysis population, frailty is associated with
higher mortality, independent of clinical and demographic characteristics and
comorbidity. The prevalence of frailty among patients with non-dialysis-dependent
chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also high, and cross-sectional data suggest that 
the prevalence may increase as CKD progresses. Thus, interventions to improve
frailty have the potential to improve quality of life and mortality. Although
interventions to improve physical dysfunction have been successful in the
population with end-stage renal disease, no studies have specifically targeted
frail individuals. Therefore, the extent to which exercise or physical activity
interventions are feasible among frail patients and can improve frailty urgently 
needs to be examined. In the meantime, providers should refer frail patients to
physical therapists and encourage them to be more active if possible. In
addition, more attention should be focused on the possibility that rehabilitation
among patients with earlier stages of CKD could improve dialysis outcomes.
KEY MESSAGES: Frailty is extremely common among patients on dialysis and is
independently associated with adverse outcomes. Providers should take advantage
of available resources to improve functioning in this population, and research
should address the optimal strategy for addressing frailty, including timing of
intervention.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at increased risk of sudden cardiac
death, the risk of which is presumably related to arrhythmia.
Electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters have been found to correlate with
arrhythmia and predict cardiovascular outcomes in ESRD patients. Frailty is also 
a common feature in this population. We investigate whether the severity of
dialysis frailty is associated with ECG findings, including PR interval, QRS
duration, and QTc interval. Presence and severity of frailty was ascertained
using six different self-report questionnaires with proven construct validity.
Correlation analysis between frailty severity and ECG was made, and those with
significant association entered into multiple regression analysis for
confirmation. Among a cohort of chronic hemodialysis patients, we found that
frailty severity, assessed by the Edmonton frailty scale, is significantly
associated with QRS duration (r = - 0.3, p < 0.05). Dialysis patients with QRS
longer than 120 ms had significantly lower severity of frailty than those with
QRS less than 120 ms (p = 0.01 for the Edmonton frailty scale and 0.05 for simple
FRAIL scale). Regression analysis showed that frailty severity, assessed by the
Edmonton frailty scale and simple FRAIL scale, was significantly associated with 
QRS duration independent of serum electrolyte levels. In conclusion, a
significant relationship exists between the severity of frailty and QRS duration 
in ESRD patients. This might be an under-recognized link between frailty and its 
adverse cardiovascular impact in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Although frailty has been linked to higher risk of falls and fracture
in the general population, only few studies have examined the extent to which
frailty is associated with these outcomes among patients with end-stage renal
disease, who are at particularly high risk for these events.
METHODS: A total of 1,646 patients who were beginning maintenance hemodialysis in
297 dialysis units throughout the United States from September 2005 to June 2007 
were enrolled in the Comprehensive Dialysis Study, and 1,053 Medicare
beneficiaries were included in this study. Self-reported frailty was defined by
the patients endorsing 2 or more of the following: poor physical functioning,
exhaustion or low physical activity. Falls and fractures requiring medical
attention were identified through Medicare claims data. We examined the
association between frailty and the time to first fall or fracture using the
Fine-Gray modification of Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for
demographics, Quételet's body mass index, diabetes mellitus, heart failure and
atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of patients were frail by self-report. The median 
length of follow-up was 2.5 (1.0-3.9) years. Crude rates of first medically
urgent falls or fractures were 66 and 126 per 1,000 person-years in non-frail and
self-reported frail participants, respectively. After accounting for demographic 
factors, comorbidities and the competing risk of death, self-reported frailty was
associated with a higher risk of falls or fractures requiring medical attention
(hazards ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.16-2.20).
CONCLUSION: Participants reporting frailty experienced nearly twice the risk of
medically urgent falls or fractures compared to those who did not report frailty.

In the last decade, an increasing number of patients over 75 years of age are
starting renal replacement therapy. Frailty is highly prevalent in elderly
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the context of the increased
prevalence of some ESRD-associated conditions: protein-energy wasting,
inflammation, anaemia, acidosis or hormonal disturbances. There are currently no 
hard data to support guidance on the optimal duration of dialysis for
frail/elderly ESRD patients. The current debate is not about starting dialysis or
managing conservatory frail ESRD patients, but whether a more intensive regimen
once dialysis is initiated (for whatever reasons and circumstances) would improve
patients' outcome. The most important issue is that all studies performed with
extended/alternative dialysis regimens do not specifically address this
particular type of patients and therefore all the inferences are derived from the
general ESRD population. Care planning should be responsive to end-of-life needs 
whatever the treatment modality. Care in this setting should focus on symptom
control and quality of life rather than life extension. We conclude that, similar
to the general dialysed population, extensive application of more intensive
dialysis schedules is not based on solid evidence. However, after a thorough
clinical evaluation, a limited period of a trial of intensive dialysis could be
prescribed in more problematic patients.

BACKGROUND: Currently over 55% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are
aged ≥60 years and patients >75 years represent the fastest growing segment of
the dialysis population. We aimed to assess whether the Groningen frailty
indicator (GFI) can be used to distinguish fit older ESRD patients, likely able
to tolerate and benefit from dialysis, from frail older patients who need further
evaluation with a geriatrician's comprehensive assessment.
METHODS: All patients aged ≥65 years visiting the pre-dialysis unit at the Gelre 
hospital between 2007 and 2013 were included and underwent the GFI (n = 65).
Patients with GFI ≥ 4 (frail) were referred for geriatric consultation (n = 13). 
Results of the GFI and nephrologists' evaluation were compared with
geriatrician's assessment. Survival rates and outcomes after one year of follow
up were recorded.
RESULTS: Twenty patients (32%) were identified as frail. Of the problems
identified by the geriatrician in 13 patients, 55% were not reported in the
nephrologists' notes. The first year after inclusion, 30% of patients with a
GFI ≥ 4 died, compared to 9% of fit patients (p = 0.04). Moreover, 90% of frail
patients had been hospitalized one or more times, compared to 53% in the fit
group (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Although the GFI can be a useful instrument to identify ESRD patients
at risk, both the GFI and the nephrologists' assessment failed to identify
specific geriatric impairments. Further research is needed to develop a specific 
frailty indicator for ESRD patients and to determine the value and effect of a
comprehensive geriatric assessment in ESRD patients.

BACKGROUND: The elderly form an expanding proportion of patients with chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide. The increased physiological
frailty and functional morbidity associated with the aging process pose unique
challenges when planning optimal management of an older patient needing renal
replacement therapy (RRT).
AIMS: This position paper discusses current evidence regarding the optimal
management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly with an emphasis on
hemodialysis since it is the most common modality used in older patients. Further
research is needed to define relevant patient-reported outcome measures for
end-stage renal disease including functional assessments and psychological
impacts of various forms of RRT. For those older patients who have opted for
dialysis treatment, it is important to study the strategies that encourage
greater uptake of home-based dialysis therapies and optimal vascular access.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of advanced chronic kidney disease in the elderly can
be challenging but also extremely rewarding. The key issue is adopting a
patient-focused and individualized approach that seeks to achieve the best
outcomes based on a comprehensive holistic assessment of what is important to the
patient.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

BACKGROUND: Frailty, a validated measure of physiologic reserve, predicts adverse
health outcomes among adults with end-stage renal disease. Frailty typically is
not measured clinically; instead, a surrogate-perceived frailty-is used to inform
clinical decision-making. Because correlations between perceived and measured
frailty remain unknown, the aim of this study was to assess their relationship.
METHODS: 146 adults undergoing hemodialysis were recruited from a single dialysis
center in Baltimore, Maryland. Patient characteristics associated with perceived 
(reported by nephrologists, nurse practitioners (NPs), or patients) or measured
frailty (using the Fried criteria) were identified using ordered logistic
regression. The relationship between perceived and measured frailty was assessed 
using percent agreement, kappa statistic, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and 
prevalence of misclassification of frailty. Patient characteristics associated
with misclassification were determined using Fisher's exact tests, t-tests, or
median tests.
RESULTS: Older age (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.36, 95%CI:1.11-1.68, P = 0.003 per
5-years older) and comorbidity (aOR = 1.49, 95%CI:1.27-1.75, P < 0.001 per
additional comorbidity) were associated with greater likelihood of
nephrologist-perceived frailty. Being non-African American was associated with
greater likelihood of NP- (aOR = 5.51, 95%CI:3.21-9.48, P = 0.003) and patient-
(aOR = 4.20, 95%CI:1.61-10.9, P = 0.003) perceived frailty. Percent agreement
between perceived and measured frailty was poor (nephrologist, NP, and patient:
64.1%, 67.0%, and 55.5%). Among non-frail participants, 34.4%, 30.0%, and 31.6%
were perceived as frail by a nephrologist, NP, or themselves. Older adults (P <
0.001) were more likely to be misclassified as frail by a nephrologist; women (P 
= 0.04) and non-African Americans (P = 0.02) were more likely to be misclassified
by an NP. Neither age, sex, nor race was associated with patient
misclassification.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceived frailty is an inadequate proxy for measured frailty among 
patients undergoing hemodialysis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

BACKGROUND: The usage of nursing home (NH) services is a marker of frailty among 
older adults. Although the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) revised
the Medical Evidence Report Form CMS-2728 in 2005 to include data collection on
NH institutionalization, the validity of this item has not been reported.
METHODS: There were 27,913 patients ≥ 75 years of age with incident end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) in 2006, which constituted our analysis cohort. We
determined the accuracy of the CMS-2728 using a matched cohort that included the 
CMS Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0, often employed as a "gold standard" metric for
identifying patients receiving NH care. We calculated sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the
CMS-2728 NH item. Next, we compared characteristics and mortality risk by
CMS-2728 and MDS NH status agreement.
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the CMS-2728 for NH status 
were 33%, 97%, 80% and 79%, respectively. Compared to those without the MDS or
CMS-2728 NH indicator (No MDS/No 2728), multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95%
confidence interval) for mortality associated with NH status were 1.55 (1.46 -
1.64) for MDS/2728, 1.48 (1.42 - 1.54) for MDS/No 2728, and 1.38 (1.25 - 1.52)
for No MDS/2728. NH utilization was more strongly associated with mortality than 
other CMS-2728 items in the model.
CONCLUSIONS: The CMS-2728 underestimated NH utilization among older adults with
incident ESRD. The potential for misclassification may have important
ramifications for assessing prognosis, developing advanced care plans and
providing coordinated care.

AIM: Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on its impact
on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different
self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these patients has not been
attempted before.
METHODS: A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural centre was
recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered
to these patients. Clinical and dialysis-related laboratory parameters were
collected. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis
complications were performed, and variables demonstrating significant
correlations were entered into multivariate regression models to determine their 
independent associations.
RESULTS: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail
Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and
Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic
dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire showed significant association with each
other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated
significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher Liu's
comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and creatinine
levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The other five
questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important
dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis
identified an independently negative association between serum albumin and the
simple FRAIL scale results (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study establishing the utility of different
self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients.
The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a closer relationship with
dialysis-related complications.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Testosterone among Patients with End-Stage Renal
Disease.

Bao Y(1), Johansen KL.

Author information: 
(1)John Muir Medical Group, Walnut Creek, California.

The prevalence of low testosterone level is particularly high among patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been associated with mortality. In
populations without ESRD, low testosterone level has also been associated with a 
number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low
muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty. However, there
is controversy regarding what constitutes low testosterone level in the aging
population and at what level replacement therapy with testosterone is indicated. 
There are no randomized controlled trials investigating long-term outcomes of
testosterone replacement therapy in populations with or without ESRD. Available
trial results suggest equivocal improvements in sexual function. Muscle mass and 
bone mineral density appear to improve, but results in physical function and
performance are mixed and there are no data on fracture prevention. Some recent
data suggest harm when testosterone was given to men with limited mobility.
Finally, there is little evidence that testosterone adds to existing
erythropoietin agents in the treatment of anemia in ESRD. Due to lack of evidence
supporting long-term use of testosterone, the authors recommend against the
routine use of testosterone in ESRD patients with low testosterone levels.
Testosterone treatment can be considered in those with low bone mass and total
testosterone level <200 ng/dl, or in younger patients with sexual complaints with
total testosterone level lower than the reference range. It is important to
engage patients in discussion of risks and benefits before initiating
testosterone therapy; testosterone therapy should be discontinued if the intended
treatment effect is not observed after short-term use.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with chronic kidney disease stage 5 may be offered a
choice between dialysis and conservative management. Few studies have explored
patients' reasons for choosing conservative management and none have compared the
views of those who have chosen different treatments across renal units.
STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative study with semistructured interviews.
SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: Patients 75 years or older recruited from 9 renal units.
Units were chosen to reflect variation in the scale of delivery of conservative
management.
METHODOLOGY: Semistructured interviews audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: 42 interviews were completed, 4 to 6 per renal unit. Patients were
sampled from those receiving dialysis, those preparing for dialysis, and those
choosing conservative management. 14 patients in each group were interviewed.
Patients who had chosen different treatments held varying beliefs about what
dialysis could offer. The information that patients reported receiving from
clinical staff differed between units. Patients from units with a more
established conservative management pathway were more aware of conservative
management, less often believed that dialysis would guarantee longevity, and more
often had discussed the future with staff. Some patients receiving conservative
management reported that they would have dialysis if they became unwell in the
future, indicating the conditional nature of their decision.
LIMITATIONS: Recruitment of older adults with frailty and comorbid conditions was
difficult and therefore transferability of findings to this population is
limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with chronic kidney disease stage 5 who have chosen
different treatment options have contrasting beliefs about the likely outcomes of
dialysis for those who are influenced by information provided by renal units.
Supporting renal staff in discussing conservative management as a valid
alternative to dialysis for a subset of patients will aid informed decision
making. There is a need for better evidence about conservative management to
support shared decision making for older people with chronic kidney failure.

Hemodialysis (HD) is routinely offered to patients with end-stage renal disease
in the United States who are ineligible for other renal replacement modalities.
The frequency of HD among the US population is greater than all other countries, 
except Taiwan and Japan. In US, patients are often dialyzed irrespective of age, 
comorbidities, prognosis, or decision-making capacity. Determination of when
patients can no longer dialyze is variable and can be dialysis-center specific.
Determinants may be related to progressive comorbidities and frailty, mobility or
access issues, patient self-determination, or an inability to tolerate the
treatment safely for any number of reasons (e.g., hypotension, behavioral
issues). Behavioral issues may impact the safety of not only patients themselves,
but also those around them. In this article the authors present the case of an
elderly patient on HD with progressive cognitive impairment and combative
behavior placing him and others at risk of physical harm. The authors discuss the
medical, ethical, legal, and psychosocial challenges to care of such patients who
lack decision-making capacity with a focus on variable approaches by regions and 
culture. This manuscript provides recommendations and highlights resources to
assist nephrologists, dialysis personnel, ethics consultants, and palliative
medicine teams in managing such patients to resolve conflict.

BACKGROUND: A well-accepted definition of frailty includes measurements of
physical performance, which may limit its clinical utility.
STUDY DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, we compared prevalence and patient
characteristics based on a frailty definition that uses self-reported function to
the classic performance-based definition and developed a modified
self-report-based definition.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prevalent adult patients receiving hemodialysis in 14
centers around San Francisco and Atlanta in 2009-2011.
INDEX TESTS: Self-report-based frailty definition in which a score lower than 75 
on the Physical Function scale of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)
was substituted for gait speed and grip strength in the classic definition;
modified self-report definition with optimized Physical Function score cutoff
points derived in a development (one-half) cohort and validated in the other
half.
REFERENCE TEST: Performance-based frailty defined as 3 of the following: weight
loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed.
RESULTS: 387 (53%) patients were frail based on self-reported function, of whom
209 (29% of the cohort) met the performance-based definition. Only 23 (3%) met
the performance-based definition of frailty only. The self-report definition had 
90% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 54% positive predictive value, 93% negative
predictive value, and 72.5% overall accuracy. Intracellular water per kilogram of
body weight and serum albumin, prealbumin, and creatinine levels were highest
among nonfrail individuals, intermediate among those who were frail by
self-report, and lowest among those who also were frail by performance. Age,
percentage of body fat, and C-reactive protein level followed an opposite
pattern. The modified self-report definition had better accuracy (84%; 95% CI,
79%-89%) and superior specificity (88%) and positive predictive value (67%).
LIMITATIONS: Our study did not address prediction of outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the self-report-based but not the
performance-based definition of frailty may represent an intermediate phenotype. 
A modified self-report definition can improve the accuracy of a
questionnaire-based method of defining frailty.

BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides
(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

BACKGROUND: Although dialysis prolongs life for patients with end-stage kidney
disease, 20% of deaths in this population are preceded by dialysis therapy
withdrawal. Recently, there has been more focus on conservative (nondialytic)
care as a legitimate option, particularly for elderly patients. This study aims
to describe patients' and caregivers' perspectives on conservative treatment and 
end-of-life care in chronic kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.
SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with CKD and caregivers.
SEARCH STRATEGY & SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and reference lists
were searched to May 2013.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the findings.
RESULTS: 26 studies involving more than 711 patients (non-dialysis dependent
[n=41], hemodialysis [n=544], peritoneal dialysis [n=9]; unspecified dialysis
modality [n=31], conservative management [n=86]) and 178 caregivers were
included. We identified 5 themes: invasive suffering (bodily deterioration, loss 
of freedom and independence, unyielding fatigue and pain, resignation, treatment 
burden and harm, financial strain), personal vulnerability (imminence of death,
misunderstanding and judgment, autonomy and dignity, medical abandonment, trust
and safety), relational responsibility (being a burden, demonstrating loyalty,
protecting others from grief), negotiating existential tensions (accepting
natural course of life, disrupted aging, worthlessness, living on borrowed time, 
respecting sanctity of life, life satisfaction, preserving self-identity), and
preparedness (decisional clarity, informational power, spirituality and hope).
LIMITATIONS: Non-English articles were excluded; therefore, the transferability
of findings to other populations is unclear.
CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with CKD experience physical and psychosocial frailty 
and feel ambivalent about prolonging life. Some caregivers believe in providing
relief from suffering, but are uncertain about making decisions regarding
dialysis therapy initiation and discontinuation. We suggest that CKD management
should encompass palliative care strategies that promote emotional resilience,
sense of well-being, and self-value. Also, respectful and attentive communication
may empower patients to convey their values and preferences about their own care.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults but is underrecognized
and undertreated. The approach to pain assessment and management in older adults 
requires an understanding of the physiology of aging, validated assessment tools,
and common pain presentations among older adults.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the overall principles of pain management in older adults 
with a specific focus on common painful conditions and approaches to
pharmacologic treatment.
METHODS: We searched PubMed for common pain presentations in older adults with
heart failure, end-stage renal disease, dementia, frailty, and cancer. We also
reviewed guidelines for pain management. Our review encompassed 2 guidelines, 10 
original studies, and 22 review articles published from 2000 to the present. This
review does not discuss nonpharmacologic treatments of pain.
RESULTS: Clinical guidelines support the use of opioids in persistent
nonmalignant pain. Opioids should be used in patients with moderate or severe
pain or pain not otherwise controlled but with careful attention to potential
toxic effects and half-life. In addition, clinical practice guidelines recommend 
use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with extreme caution and for
defined, limited periods.
CONCLUSION: An understanding of the basics of pain pathophysiology, assessment,
pharmacologic management, and a familiarity with common pain presentations will
allow clinicians to effectively manage pain for older adults.

Frailty is a physiologic state of increased vulnerability to stressors that
results from decreased physiologic reserves or dysregulation of multiple
physiologic systems. The construct of frailty has been operationalized as a
composite of poor physical function, exhaustion, low physical activity, and
weight loss. Several studies have now examined the prevalence of frailty among
chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and have 
found frailty to be more common among individuals with CKD than among those
without. Furthermore, frailty is associated with adverse outcomes among incident 
dialysis patients, including higher risk of hospitalization and death. Recent
evidence shows that frail patients are started on dialysis earlier (at a higher
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) on average than nonfrail patients,
but it remains unclear whether these patients' frailty is a result of uremia or
is independent of CKD. The survival disadvantage that has been associated with
early initiation of dialysis in observational studies could be mediated in part
through confounding on the basis of unmeasured frailty. However, available data
do not suggest improvement in frailty upon initiation of dialysis; rather, the
trajectory appears to be toward higher levels of dependence in activities of
daily living (ADLs) after dialysis initiation. Overall, there are no data to
suggest that frail patients derive any benefit from early initiation of dialysis 
either in the form of improved survival or functional status.

BACKGROUND: Observational studies of preventive medications, such as
vaccinations, can suffer from the healthy-user bias because vaccinated patients
may be healthier than unvaccinated patients. Indicators of health status and
frailty suitable for attenuating this bias could be identified in administrative 
data.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of baseline variables and time-dependent
hospitalization and skilled nursing care with the receipt of influenza
vaccination in patients with end-stage renal disease.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Observational cohort study using United States Renal Data System
files each year from 1999 to 2005.
SUBJECTS: Population-based cohorts that included >115,000 adult, hemodialysis
patients each year.
MEASURES: We estimated hazard ratios for the association of baseline variables
and time-dependent hospitalization days and skilled nursing days with influenza
vaccination, controlling for demographic and baseline health status variables.
RESULTS: Vaccination coverage increased from 47% in 1999 to 60% in 2005. Patients
with any length of hospitalization were less likely to be vaccinated, however,
the association was stronger in patients with longer stays [15-25 d: hazard
ratio=0.64 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.65); 26-30 d: 0.40 (0.38-0.42)].
Patients with any length of skilled nursing care of >1 day had similar estimates;
these patients were also less likely to be vaccinated [26-30 d: 0.66
(0.64-0.69)].
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with long hospitalizations or skilled nursing stays were
less likely to be vaccinated suggesting evidence of the healthy-user effect.
These variables could be used to account for bias in studies of preventive
services in patients on dialysis.

The end-stage renal disease population is aging. Nearly half of all new patients 
are older than 65 years and one third are older than 70 years. Assessing the
possibility of transplantation for older patients with end-stage renal disease
often involves contemplating more complex issues, including cognitive impairment,
decreased functional status, and frailty, which makes selecting appropriate
candidates more difficult. Older transplant recipients have decreased patient and
transplant survival compared with younger recipients. For example, 75% of
deceased donor transplant recipients aged 30-49 years are alive after 5 years
compared to only 61% for those older than 65 years. Despite poorer outcomes
compared with younger recipients, older transplant recipients have a significant 
improvement in survival compared with similar patients who remain on the wait
list, with decreases in mortality of 41%-61% depending on the study. Use of
living donors, even older living donors, provides significantly better outcomes
for elderly recipients compared with the use of deceased donors. However, in the 
absence of a living donor, survival is improved significantly by accepting an
expanded criteria donor organ rather than waiting for a standard criteria
deceased donor. Older transplant recipients experience more infectious
complications and less acute rejection, but the risk of transplant loss from
rejection is increased compared with younger patients. These immunologic issues, 
along with the fact that older patients often are excluded from transplant
trials, have made selecting an ideal immunosuppressive regimen challenging.
Prospective comparative trials of different agents in the elderly population are 
warranted to better define the risk-benefit profile. This review discusses
transplantation outcomes, including patient and transplant survival, different
donor types, quality of life, and immunosuppression for older dialysis patients.

INTRODUCTION: The development and potential clinical use of tissue-selective
androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) have advanced tremendously over the past few
years. A key aspect of SARMs is the ability to clearly differentiate between the 
anabolic and androgenic activities. SARMs provide therapeutic opportunities in a 
variety of diseases, including muscle wasting associated with burns, cancer,
end-stage renal disease, osteoporosis, frailty and hypogonadism.
AREAS COVERED: The aim of the present paper is to summarize the current standing 
of research and development of SARMs and plausible molecular mechanisms
underlying the potential for selective modulation of androgen receptor (AR) by
different ligands. This paper also provides an update on SARM discovery paradigms
for preclinical evaluations.
EXPERT OPINION: Promising results have been obtained in preclinical
investigations and initial clinical trials, but long-term safety, tolerability
and efficacy studies in patients are still necessary. Preclinically, improving
knowledge of tissue selectivity at the molecular level, developing AR selectivity
transcription profile, exploring in vitro/in vivo correlation, along with
expanding selectivity evaluation among more androgen responsive tissues would
accelerate the discovery of a new generation of more selective and safer clinical
candidates, minimize false leads and hasten development of effective approaches
for an expanded range of clinical conditions.

Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease among older adults: a focus on the oldest 
old.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 
(KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation,
Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of
kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease
to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of
older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress
to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific
cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older
adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have
shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated 
with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis)
and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally
thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes 
include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research
studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD 
and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the
longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the
oldest old with CKD.

BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and
its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we
hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between
earlier dialysis initiation and mortality.
METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis
Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident
patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for
vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization
through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the 
association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards
regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization.
RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73%.
In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with 
higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25-1.97]; P < .001) and time to first
hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45]; P < .001). While higher eGFR at
dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23]
per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically
significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the 
United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation.
Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier
initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described
association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.

Risk of herpes zoster in patients treated with long-term hemodialysis: a matched 
cohort study.

Memorial Hospital, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: The risk of herpes zoster in the dialysis population relative to the 
general population is not known. The aim of this study was to perform a
population-based cohort study to investigate the risk of herpes zoster after the 
initiation of hemodialysis therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) in Taiwan, a country with the highest incidence of ESRD in the world.
STUDY DESIGN: Matched cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health
Insurance Research Database. 843 patients who were beginning hemodialysis therapy
in 1999-2003 were included as the study cohort and 3,372 patients without ESRD
matched for age and sex were included as a comparison cohort. A multivariate
frailty Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to adjust for
confounding and compare the 6-year herpes zoster-free survival rate between these
2 cohorts.
PREDICTORS: Hemodialysis.
OUTCOMES: Herpes zoster.
RESULTS: Mean years of follow-up were 4.73 and 5.49 for the hemodialysis and
comparison cohorts, respectively. 868 patients developed herpes zoster throughout
the study period, 294 from the hemodialysis cohort and 574 from the comparison
cohort. The incidence rate of herpes zoster (73.34 events/1,000 person-year) was 
significantly higher in the hemodialysis cohort than in the control cohort (31.03
events/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for potential confounders, the
adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.72-2.27).
LIMITATIONS: We expect that some patients with mild zoster chose not to seek
medical help.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients treated with long-term hemodialysis are at
an increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population.

BACKGROUND: The increased incidence of cancer in dialysis patients has been
discussed since the mid-70s. Consequently, oncologists, nephrologists and
pharmacists are increasingly facing challenging situations of cytotoxic drug
handling in dialysis patients. In dialysis patients, two main issues must be
considered. First, renal function of hemodialysis (HD) patients is no longer
functional. Therefore, these patients may necessitate drug dosage reduction,
namely drug prescription, must be cautiously checked before administration with
appropriate dosage adjustment whenever necessary to ensure efficacy while
avoiding overdosage and related side effects. Secondly, drug clearance by
dialysis must be taken into account for appropriate chemotherapy timing in order 
to avoid drug removal, which may result in a loss of efficacy.
METHODS: We reviewed the international literature on the pharmacokinetics,
efficacy, tolerance and dosage adjustment of anticancer drugs used on
hemodialysis cancer patients, using the key words: kidney, renal, dialysis,
hemodialysis, end-stage renal disease and the name of each drug.
RESULTS: Only case reports and small series were found. 57.1% of the drugs need
dosage adjustment and 64.3% should be administered after the dialysis session.
CONCLUSION: Cancer treatment in feasible in dialysis patients. Some drugs require
dosage adaptation while others can be given as in patients with normal kidney
function. These patients need coordinated care between oncologists, nephrologists
and pharmacists to optimize drug delivery and logistics. Frailty scores, like in 
oncogeriatrics, should be built to optimally adapt cancer treatments in these
dialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: For chronic hemodialysis, the ideal permanent vascular access is the 
arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Temporary catheters should be reserved for acute
dialysis needs. The AVF is associated with lower infection rates, better clinical
results, and a higher quality of life and survival when compared to temporary
catheters. In Brazil, the proportion of patients with temporary catheters for
more than 3 months from the beginning of therapy is used as an evaluation of the 
quality of renal units. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated
with the time between the beginning of hemodialysis with temporary catheters and 
the placement of the first arteriovenous fistula in Brazil.
METHODS: This is an observational, prospective non-concurrent study using
national administrative registries of all patients financed by the public health 
system who began renal replacement therapy (RRT) between 2000 and 2004 in Brazil.
Incident patients were eligible who had hemodialysis for the first time. Patients
were excluded who: had hemodialysis reportedly started after the date of death
(inconsistent database); were younger than 18 years old; had HIV; had no record
of the first dialysis unit; and were dialyzed in units with less than twenty
patients. To evaluate individual and renal unit factors associated with the event
of interest, the frailty model was used (N = 55,589).
RESULTS: Among the 23,824 patients (42.9%) who underwent fistula placement in the
period of the study, 18.2% maintained the temporary catheter for more than three 
months until the fistula creation. The analysis identified five statistically
significant factors associated with longer time until first fistula: higher age
(Hazard-risk - HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00); having hypertension and cardiovascular
diseases (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.98) as the cause of chronic renal disease;
residing in capitals cities (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95) and certain regions in
Brazil - South (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.8-0.87), Midwest (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94),
Northeast (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94), or North (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94) and
the type of renal unit (public or private).
CONCLUSION: Monitoring the provision of arteriovenous fistulas in renal units
could improve the care given to patients with end stage renal disease.

Epidemiology and management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly.

Elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk of
developing aging-related problems, such as frailty, impaired physical function,
falls, poor nutrition and cognitive impairment. These factors affect dialysis
outcomes, which can be very poor in frail, elderly patients who often experience 
a decline in overall health and physical function and have short survival. The
default treatment option for these patients is hospital-based hemodialysis, often
with little consideration of how this modality will affect the survival or
quality of life of individual patients. A comparison of quality of life of
elderly patients on hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis shows that those on
peritoneal dialysis have less illness intrusion. Assisted peritoneal dialysis
enables a greater number of frail, elderly patients to have dialysis in their own
homes. Dialysis may not extend survival for those with multiple comorbidities, so
conservative care (nondialysis treatment) should be considered. To improve the
outcomes of elderly patients with ESRD, it is necessary to develop a realistic
approach to overall prognosis, quality of life and how the patient copes with the
disabilities associated with aging. This approach includes having discussions
regarding choice of treatment and end-of-life goals with patients and families.

The numbers of older patients requiring dialysis therapy is rising, reflecting
the ageing of the general population. Older dialysis patients have a tendency to 
present later for dialysis, have a higher number of comorbid conditions, are at
higher risk of cognitive dysfunction and have increased levels of frailty. These 
are all barriers to home dialysis therapy so hospital haemodialysis (HD) is the
predominant dialysis modality for older patients. Evidence suggests, however,
that home treatment with peritoneal dialysis (PD) intrudes less into the life of 
older patients than hospital HD. Assisted PD is available in some countries and
this enables more older patients to be treated in their own homes. Adjustments to
patient education also need to be made to accommodate the barriers to learning
and decision-making that often exist in older people.

BACKGROUND: Twenty-five to 30% of new renal replacement therapy (RRT) patients
present late to renal services. The proportion in whom this is avoidable, and
whether awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has reduced its incidence is
not known.
METHODS: Adult patients starting RRT (2003-2008) in a single unit were grouped
according to the time interval between first presentation to the unit and start
of RRT: <90 days (late presenters); 90-364 days; ≥ 365 days. 'Late presenters'
were classified as follows: acute kidney injury--patients who had acute but
irreversible renal failure; 'avoidable' late referrals, if they had known
pre-existing CKD and 'unavoidable' late referrals, if they had unpredictable
rapid progression of their CKD or had no prior contact with health care.
Mortality risk associated with late presentation was explored using multivariable
Cox regression.
RESULTS: Late presentation was common (24.3%) but late referrals accounted for
only 7.4% and 3.9% were avoidable. The incidence of late referrals decreased from
9.2% in 2003-2005 to 5.5% in 2006-2008 (trend P = 0.07). Late presentation was
associated with increased mortality after adjusting for comorbidity,
transplantation and permanent vascular access, and the majority of late
presenters died due to malignancy or withdrawal of RRT.
CONCLUSIONS: The lower incidence of late referrals and the falling trend could be
due to implementation of automated estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting
and the increased awareness of CKD in primary care. Future prospective studies
are needed to examine the extent to which frailty contributes to this mortality
risk.

Physical inactivity contributes to the frailty and the decline in function that
develops over time among patients with end-stage renal disease. We assessed
physical activity among 1547 ambulatory patients new to dialysis in the United
States Renal Data System Comprehensive Dialysis Study. We used a self-reporting
Human Activity Profile that included Maximal and Adjusted Activity Scores and
compared results to established norms by age and gender. Physical activity was
found to be extremely low with scores for all age and gender categories below the
5th percentile of healthy individuals and 95% of patients had scores consonant
with low fitness. Older age, female gender, diabetes, atherosclerotic disease,
and a low level of education were associated with lower activity scores assessed 
by univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis. Higher serum albumin,
creatinine, and lower body mass index, but not hemoglobin levels, were associated
with greater physical activity. By multivariable analysis, patients on
hemodialysis using a catheter reported lower levels of physical activity compared
to those on peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis using an arteriovenous fistula, or 
with a graft. Lower Maximal and Adjusted Activity Scores were associated with
poor physical function and mental health. Hence, physical activity is
distressingly low among patients new to dialysis. Thus, strategies to enhance
activity in these patients should be explored.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

Androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in the function of several organs
including primary and accessory sexual organs, skeletal muscle, and bone, making 
it a desirable therapeutic target. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs)
bind to the AR and demonstrate osteo- and myo-anabolic activity; however, unlike 
testosterone and other anabolic steroids, these nonsteroidal agents produce less 
of a growth effect on prostate and other secondary sexual organs. SARMs provide
therapeutic opportunities in a variety of diseases, including muscle wasting
associated with burns, cancer, or end-stage renal disease, osteoporosis, frailty,
and hypogonadism. This review summarizes the current standing of research and
development of SARMs, crystallography of AR with SARMs, plausible mechanisms for 
their action and the potential therapeutic indications for this emerging class of
drugs.

BACKGROUND: Given the volume and cost of inpatient care during the last year of
life, there is a critical need to identify patterns of dying as a means of
planning end-of-life care services, especially for the growing number of older
persons who receive services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
METHODS: A retrospective computerized record review was conducted of 20,933 VHA
patients who died as inpatients between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002.
Diagnoses were aggregated into one of five classification patterns of death and
analyzed in terms of health care resource utilization (mean number of inpatient
days and cumulative outpatient visits in the year preceding the patient's death).
RESULTS: Cancer deaths were the most common (30.4%) followed by end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) (23.2%), cardiopulmonary failure (21.4%), frailty (11.6%), "other"
diagnoses (7.3%), and sudden deaths (6.1%). Those with ESRD were more likely to
be male and nonwhite (p < 0.05) and those with frailty were more likely to be
older and married (p < 0.05). Controlling for demographic variables, those with
frailty had the highest number of inpatient days while those with ESRD had the
highest number of outpatient visits. Non-married status was associated with more 
inpatient days, especially among younger decedents.
CONCLUSION: As a recognized leader in end-of-life care, the VHA can play a unique
role in the development of specific interventions that address the diverse needs 
of persons with different dying trajectories identified through this research.

Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMS) bind to the androgen receptor and 
demonstrate anabolic activity in a variety of tissues; however, unlike
testosterone and other anabolic steroids, these nonsteroidal agents are able to
induce bone and muscle growth, as well as shrinking the prostate. The potential
of SARMS is to maximise the positive attributes of steroidal androgens as well as
minimising negative effects, thus providing therapeutic opportunities in a
variety of diseases, including muscle wasting associated with burns, cancer,
end-stage renal disease, osteoporosis, frailty and hypogonadism. This review
summarises androgen physiology, the current status of the R&D of SARMS and
potential therapeutic indications for this emerging class of drugs.

Analysis of clustered recurrent event data with application to hospitalization
rates among renal failure patients.

End-stage renal disease (commonly referred to as renal failure) is of increasing 
concern in the United States and many countries worldwide. Incidence rates have
increased, while the supply of donor organs has not kept pace with the demand.
Although renal transplantation has generally been shown to be superior to
dialysis with respect to mortality, very little research has been directed
towards comparing transplant and wait-list patients with respect to morbidity.
Using national data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we
compare transplant and wait-list hospitalization rates. Hospitalizations are
subject to two levels of dependence. In addition to the dependence among
within-patient events, patients are also clustered by listing center. We propose 
two marginal methods to analyze such clustered recurrent event data; the first
model postulates a common baseline event rate, while the second features
cluster-specific baseline rates. Our results indicate that kidney transplantation
offers a significant decrease in hospitalization, but that the effect is negated 
by a waiting time (until transplant) of more than 2 years. Moreover, graft
failure (GF) results in a significant increase in the hospitalization rate which 
is greatest in the first month post-GF, but remains significantly elevated up to 
4 years later. We also compare results from the proposed models to those based on
a frailty model, with the various methods compared and contrasted.

We develop a joint model for the analysis of longitudinal and survival data in
the presence of data clustering. We use a mixed effects model for the repeated
measures that incorporates both subject- and cluster-level random effects, with
subjects nested within clusters. A Cox frailty model is used for the survival
model in order to accommodate the clustering. We then link the two responses via 
the common cluster-level random effects, or frailties. This model allows us to
simultaneously evaluate the effect of covariates on the two types of responses,
while accounting for both the relationship between the responses and data
clustering. The model was motivated by a study of end-stage renal disease
patients undergoing hemodialysis, where we wished to evaluate the effect of iron 
treatment on both the patients' hemoglobin levels and survival times, with the
patients clustered by enrollment site.

OBJECTIVE: Dialysis is the most common renal replacement therapy for patients
with end stage renal disease. This paper considers survival of dialysis patients,
aiming to assess quality of renal replacement therapy at dialysis centers in Rio 
de Janeiro, Brazil, and to investigate differences in survival between health
facilities.
METHODS: A Cox proportional hazards model, allowing for time-varying covariates
and prevalent data, was the basic method used to analyze the survival of 11,579
patients on hemodialysis in 67 health facilities in Rio de Janeiro State from
January 1998 until August 2001, using data obtained from routine information
systems. A frailty random effects model was applied to investigate differences in
mortality between health centers not explained by measured characteristics.
RESULTS: The individual variables associated with the outcome were age and
underlying disease, with diabetes being the main isolated risk factor.
Considering covariates of the health unit, two factors were associated with
performance: bigger units had on average better survival times than smaller ones 
and units which offered cyclic peritoneal dialysis performed less well than those
that did not. There were significant frailty effects among centers, with relative
risks varying between 0.24 and 3.15, and an estimated variance of 0.43.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine assessment based on health registries of the outcome of any 
high technology medical treatment is extremely important in maintaining quality
of care and in estimating the impact of changes in therapies, units, and patient 
profiles. The frailty model allowed estimation of variation in risk between
centers not attributable to any measured covariates. This can be used to guide
more specific investigation and changes in health policies related to renal
transplant therapies.

Psychosocial issues in end-stage renal disease: aging.

Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients presumably encounter multiple
stressors: the need to undergo treatment for a chronic, life-threatening illness,
age-related physical frailty and comorbidities, and exposure to psychosocial
losses related to aging. However, most studies comparing older patients
(typically patients aged 60 and older) with younger patients undergoing ESRD
therapy indicate that the psychosocial well-being reported by older patients is
at least as good as, and perhaps better than, the well-being reported by younger 
patients. These data reflect a health optimism generally characteristic of older 
persons, and ESRD patients' tendency to evaluate their functional status and
their psychosocial well-being as largely independent domains. At the same time,
availability of support from dialysis caregivers and from family members is
acknowledged as a crucial variable affecting older patients' ability to
successfully comply with treatment regimens and adjust to various ESRD therapies.
Differential psychosocial outcomes related to older patients' sociodemographic
characteristics are not well studied, but data from the United States show better
perceived physical status and psychosocial well-being among older
African-American patients than among older white patients on chronic dialysis.
Suggestions are offered for methodological and conceptual refinements of research
investigating the relation of age to psychosocial outcomes in ESRD.

Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic dialysis have
higher mortality in the United States than in many other countries. While
increasing age, white race, male sex, and/or diabetes are considered risk factors
for survival, few studies of older dialysis patients have simultaneously
considered multiple predictor variables and their interactions. Using information
contained in the 1982 to 1986 ESRD Network 20 database for Georgia and South
Carolina, we studied hospitalizations and survival of 1,354 blacks and 965 whites
who were age 60 years or older when they began dialysis therapy. Survival time
was modeled using the Cox life-table regression method. Older blacks' median age 
at dialysis initiation was 67.4, compared with 68.7 for older whites (P = 0.001).
Blacks were more likely than whites (P < 0.001) to have hypertension-related or
diabetes-related ESRD. White patients experienced approximately 25% more
hospitalization when adjustment was made for patient-days at risk. Separate
multivariate survival models were required for patients with diabetes-related
versus non-diabetes-related ESRD. Among diabetics, mortality was higher among
whites and among patients who were older when they began dialysis. Among patients
with non-diabetes-related ESRD, mortality was higher among patients who were
older when they began dialysis, but the age effect was much stronger for white
males. Our hospitalization and mortality data support the view that unmeasured
severity (or frailty) differences characterize white as compared with black
dialysis patients. Among non-diabetes-related ESRD patients, the age effect on
survival was more severe in white males than in blacks or in white females. The
high mortality we observed among older dialysis patients in Georgia and South
Carolina warrants further study; the data may in part reflect patients' lower
socioeconomic status compared with age, race, and sex-matched controls.
