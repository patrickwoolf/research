Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after
transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for
nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period
are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa …), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or
Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical
antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and
bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation,
pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H.
influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take
advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to 
six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many
years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial
pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of
pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in
diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney
transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with
co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome,
increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common
opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant
recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and 
Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of
immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective
therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy
should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

To assess whether biopsy-guided selection of kidneys from very old brain-dead
donors enables more successful transplantations, the authors of this multicenter,
observational study compared graft survival between 37 recipients of 1 or 2
histologically evaluated kidneys from donors older than 80 years and 198
reference-recipients of non-histologically evaluated single grafts from donors
aged 60 years and younger (transplantation period: 2006-2013 at 3 Italian
centers). During a median (interquartile range) of 25 (13-42) months, 2
recipients (5.4%) and 10 reference-recipients (5.1%) required dialysis (crude and
donor age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.55
[0.34-7.12], P = .576 and 1.41 [0.10-19.54], P = .798, respectively). Shared
frailty analyses confirmed similar outcomes in a 1:2 propensity score study
comparing recipients with 74 reference-recipients matched by center, year, donor,
and recipient sex and age. Serum creatinine was similar across groups during
84-month follow-up. Recipients had remarkably shorter waiting times than did
reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (7.5 [4.0-19.5] vs 36
[19-56] and 40 [24-56] months, respectively, P < .0001 for both comparisons).
Mean (± SD) kidney donor risk index was 2.57 ± 0.32 in recipients vs 1.09 ± 0.24 
and 1.14 ± 0.24 in reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients
(P < .0001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were similar across groups.
Biopsy-guided allocation of kidneys from octogenarian donors permits further
expansion of the donor organ pool and faster access to a kidney transplant,
without increasing the risk of premature graft failure.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older kidney transplant recipients are susceptible to 
cognitive impairment, frailty, comorbidities, immunosuppression-related
complications, and chronic graft failure, however, there has been limited focus
on their concerns and expectations related to transplantation. This study aims to
describe the perspectives of older kidney transplant recipients about their
experience of kidney transplantation, self-management, and treatment goals to
inform strategies and interventions that address their specific needs.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Face-to-face semistructured
interviews were conducted with 30 kidney transplant recipients aged 65-80 years
from five renal units in Australia. Transcripts were analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: Six themes were identified: restoring vitality of youth (with subthemes 
of revived mindset for resilience, embracing enjoyment in life, drive for
self-actualization); persisting through prolonged recovery (yielding to aging,
accepting functional limitations, pushing the limit, enduring treatment
responsibilities); imposing sicknesses (combatting devastating comorbidities,
painful restrictions, emerging disillusionment, anxieties about accumulating side
effects, consuming treatment burden); prioritizing graft survival (privileged
with a miracle, negotiating risks for longevity, enacting a moral duty,
preserving the last opportunity); confronting health deterioration (vulnerability
and helplessness, narrowing focus to immediate concerns, uncertainty of
survival); and value of existence (purpose through autonomy, refusing the burden 
of futile treatment, staying alive by all means).
CONCLUSIONS: Older kidney transplant recipients felt able to enjoy life and
strived to live at their newly re-established potential and capability, which
motivated them to protect their graft. However, some felt constrained by slow
recuperation and overwhelmed by unexpected comorbidities, medication-related side
effects, and health decline. Our findings suggest the need to prepare and support
older recipients for self-management responsibilities, clarify their expectations
of post-transplant risks and outcomes, and provide assistance through prolonged
recovery after kidney transplantation.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation offers improved survival and quality of life
to an increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease.
However, elderly kidney transplant recipients may face unique challenges due to a
higher burden of comorbidity, greater cumulative risk of
immunosuppression-related complications and increasing frailty. We aimed to
describe the perspectives of elderly kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to April 2015. Qualitative studies
were eligible if they reported views from elderly kidney transplant recipients
(≥60 years). Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the findings.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving >116 recipients were included. We
identified seven themes. 'Regaining strength and vitality' meant valuing the
physical and psychosocial improvements in daily functioning and life
participation. 'Extending life' was the willingness to accept any organ,
including extended criteria kidneys, to prolong survival. 'Debt of gratitude'
entailed conscious appreciation toward their donor while knowing they were unable
to repay their sacrifice. 'Moral responsibility to maintain health' motivated
adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations out of an ethical duty to
protect their gift for graft survival. 'Unabating and worsening forgetfulness'
hindered self-management. 'Disillusionment with side effects and complications'
reflected disappointment and exasperation with the unintended consequences of
medications. 'Finality of treatment option' was an acute awareness that the
current transplant may be their last.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation was perceived to slow and even reverse the
experience of aging among elderly recipients, especially compared with dialysis. 
However, some were frustrated over persistent limitations after transplant,
struggled with the burden of medication side effects and worried about a possible
return to dialysis if the transplant failed. Clarifying patient expectations of
transplantation, providing support to alleviate the debilitating impacts of
immunosuppression and addressing fears about deteriorating health and graft
failure may improve satisfaction and outcomes in elderly kidney transplant
recipients.

Alto, California, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is the concept of accumulating physiologic declines
that make people less able to deal with stressors, including surgery.
Prehabilitation is intervention to enhance functional capacity before surgery.
Frailty and prehabilitation among transplant populations and the role of wearable
fitness tracking devices (WFTs) in delivering fitness-based interventions will be
discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty is associated with increased complications, longer
length of hospital stay and increased mortality after surgery. Frail kidney
transplant patients have increased delayed graft function, mortality and early
hospital readmission. Frail lung or liver transplant patients are more likely to 
delist or die on the waitlist. Prehabilitation can mitigate frailty and has
resulted in decreased length of hospital stay and fewer postsurgical
complications among a variety of surgical populations. Increasingly, WFTs are
used to monitor patient activity and improve patient health. Interventions using 
WFTs have resulted in improved activity, weight loss and blood pressure.
SUMMARY: Frailty is a measurable parameter that identifies patients at risk for
worse health outcomes and can be mitigated through intervention. Prehabilitation 
to reduce frailty has been shown to improve postsurgical outcomes in a variety of
populations. WFTs are being integrated in healthcare delivery for monitoring and 
changing health behavior with promising results.

Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among
the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample
evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the
best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to
remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this
population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive
impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to
transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after
transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and
affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can
increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death
with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney
allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft
utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer
wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to
kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and
propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are life-threatening
complications after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only
half of CD20-positive PTLDs respond to rituximab monotherapy, and outcomes remain
poor for patients with relapsed/refractory disease, especially those who do not
qualify for an anthracycline containing regimen due to frailty or comorbidities. 
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) might be an option in this particular setting. We report
a panel of eight patients with rituximab refractory/relapsed CD20-positive PTLDs 
including three ineligible for subsequent CHOP-like chemotherapy who received
(90) Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan as a single agent (n = 7) or combined to chemotherapy
(n = 1). Five out of eight patients were kidney transplant recipients, while 2/8 
had a liver transplant and 1/8 had a heart transplant. Patients received a median
of two previous therapies. Overall response rate was 62.5%. Importantly, all
responders achieved complete response. At a median follow-up of 37 months [5;
84], complete response was ongoing in four patients. Toxicity was predominantly
hematological and easily manageable. No graft rejection was noticed concomitantly
or following RIT administration despite immunosuppression reduction after
diagnosis of PTLDs. This report emphasizes the potential efficiency of salvage
RIT for early rituximab refractory PTLDs without any unexpected toxicity.

We have previously described strong associations between frailty, a measure of
physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, and early
hospital readmission as well as delayed graft function. The goal of this study
was to estimate its association with postkidney transplantation (post-KT)
mortality. Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of
transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional hazards
models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to substantially
improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We
precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of
the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients (n = 37 858) and introduced
these into the single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty
coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5%, 86.0% and 77.5% for nonfrail, 
intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was
independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.01-4.65, p = 0.047) higher
risk of death. In conclusion, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent
risk factor for post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many
confounders using a novel, efficient statistical approach.
