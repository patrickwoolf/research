BACKGROUND: Survival for patients commencing renal replacement therapy is around 
90% in the first year and 83% at two years after starting dialysis. The factors
that appear to predict mortality are comorbidity and frailty associated with
kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate, age and biochemical factors.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse the condition of patients starting renal replacement
therapy, based on biomarkers commonly used in clinical practice and their
association with mortality, measured 6 and 12 months after initiating replacement
therapy.
METHODS: A one-year prospective follow-up study with 189 patients.
Sociodemographic variables, aetiology of renal disease, comorbidities, prior
nephrology service monitoring, prior renal transplantation and biochemical
parameters at the time of initiating replacement therapy were analysed.
RESULTS: The overall percentage of death during the one-year follow-up was 6.87%,
with 64% of deaths occurring during the first six months. The only variable
independently associated with mortality was low albumin levels.
CONCLUSION: Although most patients in this centre are monitored by a nephrologist
prior to starting replacement therapy, many nevertheless fail to achieve the
biochemical targets recommended. One such parameter is albumin, which proved at
the start of replacement therapy to be an independent predictor of mortality.
Findings of this study show the need to intervene on certain biochemical
parameters during the pre-dialysis stage and at the start of dialysis, in order
to improve survival in this group of patients.

BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the
general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear
whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney failure.
METHODS: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults with
end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South
America designed to examine the association between periodontitis and all-cause
and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis.
Participants were matched 1:1 on their propensity score for moderate to severe
periodontitis assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal 
Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared
frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries.
RESULTS: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe
periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score methods to generate a
matched cohort of participants with periodontitis similar to those with none or
mild periodontal disease, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a 
lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74,
95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 
person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were
not changed substantially when participants were limited to those with 12 or more
natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes of cardiovascular death.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does not appear 
to be associated with an increased risk of early death in adults treated with
hemodialysis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement
can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light
chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies
have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We
evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in
France.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered
in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 
with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored
for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as
renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and 
causes of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334
(23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72
years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was
observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation
was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis,
67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were 
malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and
cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty 
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high
BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is
poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of
death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

Older people constitute an increasingly greater proportion of patients with
advanced CKD, including those patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment.
Frailty is a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors
that results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and
causes vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty is common in elderly CKD
patients, and it may be associated with protein-energy wasting (PEW), sarcopenia,
dynapenia, and other complications of CKD. Causes of frailty with or without PEW 
in the elderly with CKD can be classified into three categories: causes primarily
caused by aging per se, advanced CKD per se, or a combination of both conditions.
Frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients are associated with impaired physical
performance, disability, poorer quality of life, and reduced survival. Prevention
and treatment of these conditions in the elderly CKD patients often require a
multifaceted approach. Here, we examine the causes and consequences of these
conditions and examine the interplay between frailty and PEW in elderly CKD
patients.
