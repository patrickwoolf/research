Frailty is a common complication in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) under dialysis, which is a strong risk factor for low quality of life,
morbidity, and mortality. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of
frailty in a group of Portuguese ESRD patients, and its association with
socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. We performed a
cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3
[±14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients
as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire.
Social support, data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and
haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory
markers were also evaluated. Our results confirmed that frailty is a highly
prevalent condition in ESRD patients, particularly in female patients. An
association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of
hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.

Anemia is extremely common following hip fracture. Consistent data from
randomized trials show that transfusion of less blood, with a transfusion
threshold around 8 g/dL hemoglobin concentration, is preferable to a traditional 
threshold of 10 g/dL. Adoption of a lower threshold leads to at least equivalent 
clinical outcomes, with much less exposure to transfusion costs and risks. The
most common complication of transfusion is circulatory overload. Future research 
may elucidate the optimal transfusion threshold for these elderly patients and
address the specific needs of subgroups of patients, including those with acute
coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease.
