AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of physical 
activity on various aspects in Asian dialysis patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Study participants were recruited
from 27 hospitals or dialysis centers in Korea (n = 1611). The participants were 
divided into 3 groups according to the degree of regular exercise: Inactive
group, Intermediate group, and Active group.
RESULTS: The proportions of patients with frailty and the presence of each
component decreased as physical activity increased. The presence and numbers of
disabilities decreased as physical activity increased. The number of participants
with a history of fall during the last 12 months was 149 (20.5%) in the Inactive 
group, 88 (16.9%) in the Intermediate group, and 48 (13.2%) in the Active group. 
Physical component scale and mental component scale scores increased as physical 
activity increased. The survival rate for all-cause death at 500 days was 95.5%
in the Active group, 95.2% in the Intermediate group, and 93.5% in the Inactive
group.
CONCLUSION: High physical activity was associated with favorable results for most
health-related quality of life scale scores, including frailty, disability, and
exhaustion, in Korean dialysis patients.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the
elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in
comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly
individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength,
body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and
endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined
outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were
assessed.
METHODS: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient
drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12
months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc
Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail
and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition
(DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years 
old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After 
some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30
to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; 
IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 
14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 
2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the 
casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that
frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney
disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either
worse endothelial function or mortality.

BACKGROUND: The levels of many laboratory parameters are associated with the
outcomes of dialysis patients, but the significance of their variability has not 
been well studied.
METHODS: A total of 384 patients receiving stable hemodialysis treatment during
2002 were followed up for mortality until the end of 2013. The within-patient
coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for 13 laboratory parameters from 
1 year of data. We defined variability as CV and analyzed the survival of the
patients according to the baseline CV values of each parameter by proportional
hazard modeling.
RESULTS: During the 11-year observation period, 125 patients died. Higher CV
levels for eight parameters, namely, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium,
hemoglobin, creatinine, total protein, albumin, potassium and phosphate, were
significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The adjusted hazard ratios for
a high BUN-CV (>15 %) and a high Na-CV (>1.3 %) against a lower CV were 1.92 (95 
% CI 1.31-2.81) and 1.95 (1.36-2.80), respectively. The increased mortality risk 
associated with each variability was attributed to excess non-cardiac deaths. The
CV values of most parameters were correlated with each other and often exhibited 
negative associations with age, diabetes, and mobility as well as the levels of
hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, Na, the protein catabolic rate, and the
creatinine generation rate. Therefore, a high variability was generally
associated with frailty-related adverse prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The variability of several blood parameters had a significant impact
on all-cause and non-cardiac mortality. The levels of the variabilities were most
likely related to poor physical conditions of the patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in 
individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on 
their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of
cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that
highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid
conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating
cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including
microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally,
studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected
in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with
worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk
of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible
short-term effects on markers of physical performance.
SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to 
better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of
physical functioning and encouragement of physical activity in management of the 
patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), implementation has been undermined by 
a lack of understanding of the evidence for this recommendation. The purpose of
this review is to present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic
cohorts that report associations between low levels of physical functioning
and/or low physical activity and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Low levels of physical activity and poor physical functioning
are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical outcomes in adult
patients with CKD, regardless of treatment modality. Low physical performance and
activity limitations are more prevalent in patients with CKD, regardless of age, 
compared to older community-dwelling adults.
SUMMARY: The strength of the evidence presented should strongly motivate a focus 
of treatment on assessing and improving physical activity and physical function
as part of routine patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical
activity interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of
age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that is
similar to or higher than the general population of elderly adults; physical
activity, physical function, and performance are strongly associated with
all-cause mortality; and exercise training and exercise counseling have been
shown to improve measures of physical functioning.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced
functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing
the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the
CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or
evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based
cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study.
OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association
with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more
of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss,
exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum
cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to
relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was
51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much
older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components
were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes,
eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a
2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of
frailty compared with GFR(cys) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during 
a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was
associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or 
dialysis therapy.
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal
relationships between CKD and frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is
associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.
