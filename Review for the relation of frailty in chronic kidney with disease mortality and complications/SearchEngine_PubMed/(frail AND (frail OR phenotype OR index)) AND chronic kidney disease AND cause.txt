AIM: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been
diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty,
but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with
frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study
to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic
hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited.
Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered
diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not
(Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the
prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined
the risk factors for frailty.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than 
that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the
association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients
(n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their
interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic
nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic
nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18:
1597-1602.

OBJECTIVES: Frailty can cause increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes,
such as falls, fractures, depression and reduced health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition,
HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care
utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 
2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5).
METHODS: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney
disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up
study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale);
depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and
cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools.
Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights >136 kg, and coinciding
comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded.
RESULTS: Frailty occurred in 17% of participants (n=7). Frail participants had
lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more 
depression (p=<0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and
emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p<0.05). No differences in
health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail
participants (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney
disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater
depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

Objectives To derive and validate a risk prediction equation to estimate the
short term risk of death, and to develop a classification method for frailty
based on risk of death and risk of unplanned hospital
admission.Design Prospective open cohort study.Participants Routinely collected
data from 1436 general practices contributing data to QResearch in England
between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used to develop the scores and a
separate set of 357 practices to validate the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 
65-100 years were in the derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the
validation cohort.Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation
cohort were used to derive separate risk equations in men and women for
evaluation of the risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age,
sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index,
medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent
investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the
validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group.
The new mortality equation was used in conjunction with the existing QAdmissions 
equation (which predicts risk of unplanned hospital admission) to classify
patients into frailty groups.Main outcome measure The primary outcome was all
cause mortality.Results During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the
derivation cohort arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The
final model included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic
group, smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the past 
12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive heart failure,
corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, learning disability,
leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, poor
mobility, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2
diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result,
high platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite loss,
unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good calibration and
high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the equation
explained 55.6% of the variation in time to death (R2), and had very good
discrimination-the D statistic was 2.29, and Harrell's C statistic value was
0.85. The corresponding values for men were 53.1%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining
predicted risks of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7% of patients 
(n=13 665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4% (n=46 770) as moderately
frail, 43.1% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8% (n=223 790) as
fit.Conclusions We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of
death in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social,
and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate
validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction with the
QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty groups (known as
QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be identified for further assessment
or interventions.

Global burden disease studies point out that one of the top cause-specific
anemias is iron deficiency (ID). Recent advances in knowledge of iron homeostasis
have shown that fragile patients are a new target population in which the
correction of ID might impact their morbidity, mortality and quality of life. We 
did a systematic review using specific search strategy, carried out the review of
PubMed database, Cochrane Database of systemic reviews and international
guidelines on diagnosis and clinical management of ID from 2010 to 2016. The
International guidelines were limited to those with peer-review process and
published in journal present in citation index database. The eligible studies
show that serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are the key tests in early
decision-making process to identify iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The clinician
has to carefully consider fragile and high-risk subset of patients such as elders
or individuals with chronic diseases (i.e chronic kidney disease, inflammatory
bowel disease, chronic heart failure). Treatment is based on iron
supplementation. Infusion route should be preferentially considered in frail
patients especially in the view of new iron available formulations. The available
evidences indicate that (i) recurrent IDA should always be investigated,
considering uncommon causes; (ii) IDA might worse the performance and the
clinical outcome of fragile and high-risk patients and require an intensive
treatment.

Elevated blood pressure is one of the most significant risk factor for the
development of chronic kidney disease (CKD); its treatment is a milestone in CKD 
management. While it is accepted that a stricter blood pressure control is
indicated in patients with proteinuria or microalbuminuria, the exact degree of
blood pressure reduction to be obtained in CKD patients is still under debate.
Following more recent interpretation of old trials, a BP target for <140/90 mmHg 
is suggested for non-proteinuric CKD patients. In those with
microalbuminuria/proteinuria, the ideal blood pressure target should be ≤130/80
mmHg. Recently, the SPRINT trial put new emphasis on a stricter blood pressure
control, mainly from the cardiovascular point of view. The blockers of the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are recommended as first line treatment in all CKD
hypertensive patients with micro or macroalbuminuria either diabetics or not.
However, their nephroprotective efficacy is less relevant in non-proteinuric
patients. The dual RAS blockade was proposed as an additional option. Despite a
greater antiproteinuric effect, some large trials in patients at high
cardiovascular risk did not demonstrate significant advantage on hard endpoint.
Its use is now contraindicated in diabetic CKD patients. Given that RAS blockers 
can cause acute derangements in kidney function and hyperkalemia, caution is
needed with their use, especially in frail and old patients with cardiovascular
disease or in the presence of advanced CKD.

Should chronic metabolic acidosis be treated in older people with chronic kidney 
disease?

Metabolic acidosis is common in advanced chronic kidney disease and has been
associated with a range of physiological derangements of importance to the health
of older people. These include associations with skeletal muscle weakness,
cardiovascular risk factors, and bone and mineral disorders that may lead to
fragility fractures. Although metabolic acidosis is associated with accelerated
decline in kidney function, end-stage renal failure is a much less common outcome
in older, frail patients than cardiovascular death. Correction of metabolic
acidosis using bicarbonate therapy is commonly employed, but the existing
evidence is insufficient to know whether such therapy is of net benefit to older 
people. Bicarbonate is bulky and awkward to take, may impose additional sodium
load with effects on fluid retention and blood pressure, and may cause
gastrointestinal side effects. Trial data to date suggest potential benefits of
bicarbonate therapy on progression of renal disease and nutrition, but trials
have not as yet been published examining the effect of bicarbonate therapy across
a range of domains relevant to the health of older people. Fortunately, a number 
of trials are now underway that should allow us to ascertain whether bicarbonate 
therapy can improve physical function, quality of life, and vascular, bone and
kidney health in older people, and hence decide whether any benefits seen
outweigh adverse effects and additional treatment burden in this vulnerable group
of patients.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the
elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in
comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly
individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength,
body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and
endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined
outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were
assessed.
METHODS: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient
drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12
months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc
Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail
and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition
(DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years 
old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After 
some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30
to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; 
IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 
14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 
2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the 
casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that
frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney
disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either
worse endothelial function or mortality.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide is rising markedly becoming a priority
public health problem. The progression of CKD cause functional limitation and
severe disability with poor quality of life. The aim of present review was to
highlight the effect of rehabilitation in CKD and ESRD subjects. The
rehabilitative process is unique in treating disabled people according to a
holistic approach with the aim of supporting a person's independent living and
autonomy. CKD are associated with an increased risk of functional impairment,
independent of age, gender, and co-morbidities. Clinicians should counsel
patients with CKD including frail elder people to increase physical activity
levels and target that regular physical activity including aerobic or endurance
exercises training benefits health. In old subjects with CKD and multiple
functional impairments, the traditional disease based model should be changed to 
individualized patient-centered approach that prioritizes patient preferences.
Patients receiving haemodialysis have a considerably lower exercise tolerance,
functional capacity, and more muscle wasting than healthy subjects or patients
with less severe CKD. Exercise training or comprehensive multi-dimensional
strategy and goal-oriented intervention should be also provided in ESRD older
subjects. Structured prevention programs based on reducing the risk factors for
CKD and rehabilitative strategies could reduce disability occurrence.

Anemia is an important healthcare concern among the elderly. In these patients,
the anemia is often mild, with a hemoglobin level >10 g/dL. It is usually well
tolerated, but might be responsible for several proteiform and/or atypical
presenting complaints. In the elderly, anemia is usually of multifactorial
origin, including chronic inflammation, chronic kidney disease, nutrient
deficiencies and iron deficiency (approximately two-thirds of all cases). The
remaining cases are unexplained (unknown etiology). In the elderly, the classic
diagnosis of anemia, which is based on the mean corpuscular volume associated
with a low hemoglobin level, might not be accurate. A predefined standardized
diagnostic procedure should be followed. In the common case of frail elderly
patients, all investigations should be carefully considered and invasive
examinations undertaken where justified (risk-benefit balance). Nevertheless,
most cases of anemia require further investigation and the underlying cause
should be identified and treated whenever possible.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced
functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing
the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the
CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or
evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based
cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study.
OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association
with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more
of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss,
exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum
cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to
relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was
51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much
older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components
were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes,
eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a
2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of
frailty compared with GFR(cys) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during 
a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was
associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or 
dialysis therapy.
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal
relationships between CKD and frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is
associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults,
affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are
encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap
with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder 
may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded
in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed 
to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is
being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization
and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low
testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of
whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly
CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In
this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone
abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with
CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors 
predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and
treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
importance.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many
different populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its
multitude of complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly
higher risk for cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual.
However, it is clear now that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of
the complications but also prevent them. Therefore, various important public
health organizations all over the world have turned their focus and attention to 
CKD and its risk factors, early detection and early intervention. Nevertheless,
the general goals in preventing the increase in CKD and its complications are far
from being completely achieved. Why is this so? What is the magnitude and
complexity of the problem? How is it affecting the population - are there
differences in its affection by age, gender or frail elderly versus the robust?
Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and aggressively? Are there
subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on dialysis versus the
non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of CKD aggressively, 
will it make a difference in the disease progression, its complications or to
quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly succumb to? What 
do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire dialysis or
transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for those who
refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly with
CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist?
The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality 
of life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other
vital aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day
practice by each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the
elderly with men being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively 
the vital aspects of CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical
standpoint.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although therapeutic failure may be a common cause of
drug-related morbidity in older adults, few studies have focused on this problem.
The study objective was to determine the frequency and types of, and the factors 
associated with, therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly
patients, using a new instrument named the Therapeutic Failure Questionnaire
(TFQ).
METHODS: The sample included 106 frail, hospitalised elderly patients enrolled in
a 1-year-long health service intervention trial at 11 Veterans Affairs Medical
Centres. The TFQ was developed by a team of clinical geriatricians and tested for
reliability by two clinical pharmacists and a geriatrician on a sample of 32
patients. To establish validity, a geriatrician retrospectively reviewed the
computerised medication records and clinical charts for these patients and
applied the TFQ to determine probable therapeutic failures at the time of
hospital admission.
RESULTS: Inter- and intra-rater reliability for the TFQ were very good (kappa =
0.82 for both). Overall, 11% of patients had one or more probable therapeutic
failures (TFQ scores between 4 and 7) leading to hospitalisation. Cardiopulmonary
disease was a common 'indicator' of therapeutic failure and was often the result 
of non-adherence. The only factor associated with therapeutic failure occurrence 
was severe chronic kidney disease (crude odds ratio 5.87; 95% CI 1.20, 28.69; p =
0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The TFQ was able to identify several cases of probable therapeutic
failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients. Non-adherence to
effective therapies for chronic serious cardiopulmonary disease was a common
cause of therapeutic failure and represents a target for interventions to reduce 
hospitalisation. Further research on the occurrence, risk factors for and types
of therapeutic failure is needed in a larger cohort of older non-veterans.
