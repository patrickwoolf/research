Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is rare and characterized endoscopically by
distal esophageal ulceration, blackening, and necrosis. It typically arises in
patients with multiple comorbidities who have significant systemic disease and
frailty. Specific precipitating events are variable. Evidence suggests a
multifactorial etiology likely involving esophageal ischemia in the setting of
corrosive injury from gastric contents and impaired tissue repair mechanisms. In 
the transplant setting, immunosuppression likely plays a substantial role. We
report a case of AEN in a 70-year-old man following a renal transplant.

Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after
transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for
nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period
are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa …), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or
Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical
antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and
bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation,
pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H.
influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take
advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to 
six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many
years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial
pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of
pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in
diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney
transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with
co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome,
increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common
opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant
recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and 
Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of
immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective
therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy
should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

To assess whether biopsy-guided selection of kidneys from very old brain-dead
donors enables more successful transplantations, the authors of this multicenter,
observational study compared graft survival between 37 recipients of 1 or 2
histologically evaluated kidneys from donors older than 80 years and 198
reference-recipients of non-histologically evaluated single grafts from donors
aged 60 years and younger (transplantation period: 2006-2013 at 3 Italian
centers). During a median (interquartile range) of 25 (13-42) months, 2
recipients (5.4%) and 10 reference-recipients (5.1%) required dialysis (crude and
donor age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.55
[0.34-7.12], P = .576 and 1.41 [0.10-19.54], P = .798, respectively). Shared
frailty analyses confirmed similar outcomes in a 1:2 propensity score study
comparing recipients with 74 reference-recipients matched by center, year, donor,
and recipient sex and age. Serum creatinine was similar across groups during
84-month follow-up. Recipients had remarkably shorter waiting times than did
reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (7.5 [4.0-19.5] vs 36
[19-56] and 40 [24-56] months, respectively, P < .0001 for both comparisons).
Mean (± SD) kidney donor risk index was 2.57 ± 0.32 in recipients vs 1.09 ± 0.24 
and 1.14 ± 0.24 in reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients
(P < .0001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were similar across groups.
Biopsy-guided allocation of kidneys from octogenarian donors permits further
expansion of the donor organ pool and faster access to a kidney transplant,
without increasing the risk of premature graft failure.

BACKGROUND: Frailty increases early hospital readmission and mortality risk among
kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. Although frailty represents a high-risk
state for this population, the correlates of frailty, the patterns of the 5
frailty components, and the risk associated with these patterns are unclear.
METHODS: Six hundred sixty-three KT recipients were enrolled in a cohort study of
frailty in transplantation (12/2008-8/2015). Frailty, activities of daily living 
(ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) disability, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale depression, education, and health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) were measured. We used multinomial regression to identify frailty
correlates. We identified which patterns of the 5 components were associated with
mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 19.5%. Older recipients (adjusted prevalence
ratio [PR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.07) were more likely to be
frail. The only other factors that were independently associated with frailty
were IADL disability (PR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.72-6.06), depressive symptoms (PR,
11.31; 95% CI, 4.02-31.82), less than a high school education (PR, 3.10; 95% CI, 
1.30-7.36), and low HRQOL (fair/poor: PR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.48-9.31). The most
common pattern was poor grip strength, low physical activity, and slowed walk
speed (19.4%). Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged as having an
association with post-KT mortality. KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed
walking speed (hazards ratio = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.17-5.03) and poor grip strength,
exhaustion, and slowed walking speed (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.14-5.97) were
at increased mortality risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty among
KT recipients; however, factors rarely measured as part of clinical practice,
namely, HRQOL, IADL disability, and depressive symptoms, were significant
correlates of frailty. Redefining the frailty phenotype may be needed to improve 
risk stratification for KT recipients.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether frailty, a novel measure of physiologic reserve, is
associated with longer kidney transplant (KT) length of stay (LOS), and modifies 
the association between LOS and mortality.
BACKGROUND: Better understanding of LOS is necessary for informed consent and
discharge planning. Mortality resulting from longer LOS has important regulatory 
implications for hospital and transplant programs. Which recipients are at risk
of prolonged LOS and its effect on mortality are unclear. Frailty is a novel
preoperative predictor of poor KT outcomes including delayed graft function,
early hospital readmission, immunosuppression intolerance, and mortality.
METHODS: We used registry-augmented hybrid methods, a novel approach to risk
adjustment, to adjust for LOS risk factors from the Scientific Registry of
Transplant Recipients (n = 74,859) and tested whether (1) frailty, measured
immediately before KT in a novel cohort (n = 589), was associated with LOS (LOS: 
negative binomial regression; LOS ≥2 weeks: logistic regression) and (2) whether 
frailty modified the association between LOS and mortality (interaction term
analysis).
RESULTS: Frailty was independently associated with longer LOS [relative risk =
1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.29; P = 0.01] and LOS ≥2 weeks (odds
ratio = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.06-2.33; P = 0.03) after accounting for registry-based
risk factors, including delayed graft function. Frailty also attenuated the
association between LOS and mortality (nonfrail hazard rate = 1.55 95% CI:
1.30-1.86; P < 0.001; frail hazard rate = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.19, P = 0.80; P
for interaction = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail KT recipients are more likely to experience a longer LOS.
Longer LOS among nonfrail recipients may be a marker of increased mortality risk.
Frailty is a measure of physiologic reserve that may be an important clinical
marker of longer surgical LOS.

Prehabilitation in our most frail surgical patients: are wearable fitness devices
the next frontier?

Alto, California, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is the concept of accumulating physiologic declines
that make people less able to deal with stressors, including surgery.
Prehabilitation is intervention to enhance functional capacity before surgery.
Frailty and prehabilitation among transplant populations and the role of wearable
fitness tracking devices (WFTs) in delivering fitness-based interventions will be
discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty is associated with increased complications, longer
length of hospital stay and increased mortality after surgery. Frail kidney
transplant patients have increased delayed graft function, mortality and early
hospital readmission. Frail lung or liver transplant patients are more likely to 
delist or die on the waitlist. Prehabilitation can mitigate frailty and has
resulted in decreased length of hospital stay and fewer postsurgical
complications among a variety of surgical populations. Increasingly, WFTs are
used to monitor patient activity and improve patient health. Interventions using 
WFTs have resulted in improved activity, weight loss and blood pressure.
SUMMARY: Frailty is a measurable parameter that identifies patients at risk for
worse health outcomes and can be mitigated through intervention. Prehabilitation 
to reduce frailty has been shown to improve postsurgical outcomes in a variety of
populations. WFTs are being integrated in healthcare delivery for monitoring and 
changing health behavior with promising results.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are life-threatening
complications after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only
half of CD20-positive PTLDs respond to rituximab monotherapy, and outcomes remain
poor for patients with relapsed/refractory disease, especially those who do not
qualify for an anthracycline containing regimen due to frailty or comorbidities. 
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) might be an option in this particular setting. We report
a panel of eight patients with rituximab refractory/relapsed CD20-positive PTLDs 
including three ineligible for subsequent CHOP-like chemotherapy who received
(90) Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan as a single agent (n = 7) or combined to chemotherapy
(n = 1). Five out of eight patients were kidney transplant recipients, while 2/8 
had a liver transplant and 1/8 had a heart transplant. Patients received a median
of two previous therapies. Overall response rate was 62.5%. Importantly, all
responders achieved complete response. At a median follow-up of 37 months [5;
84], complete response was ongoing in four patients. Toxicity was predominantly
hematological and easily manageable. No graft rejection was noticed concomitantly
or following RIT administration despite immunosuppression reduction after
diagnosis of PTLDs. This report emphasizes the potential efficiency of salvage
RIT for early rituximab refractory PTLDs without any unexpected toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose reduction 
or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead to rejection and
possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known about what factors might
cause or contribute to MDR. Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is
emerging as an important, novel domain of risk in kidney transplantation
recipients. We hypothesized that frailty, an inflammatory phenotype, might be
associated with MDR.
METHODS: We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical
activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor characteristics,
longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 kidney transplantation recipients. 
Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: By 2 years after transplantation, 54% of frail recipients and 45% of
nonfrail recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67% and 51%. Frail
recipients were 1.29 times (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.66; P =
0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased donor recipients (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.44-2.54, P < 0.001) and older adults (age ≥
65 vs <65; aHR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.96, P = 0.01). Mycophenolate mofetil dose
reduction was independently associated with a substantially increased risk of
death-censored graft loss (aHR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.97-13.98, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A better understanding of risk factors for MMF intolerance might help
in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression and
prolong allograft survival.

We have previously described strong associations between frailty, a measure of
physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, and early
hospital readmission as well as delayed graft function. The goal of this study
was to estimate its association with postkidney transplantation (post-KT)
mortality. Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of
transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional hazards
models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to substantially
improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We
precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of
the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients (n = 37 858) and introduced
these into the single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty
coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5%, 86.0% and 77.5% for nonfrail, 
intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was
independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.01-4.65, p = 0.047) higher
risk of death. In conclusion, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent
risk factor for post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many
confounders using a novel, efficient statistical approach.

This paper presents an extension of the joint modeling strategy for the case of
multiple longitudinal outcomes and repeated infections of different types over
time, motivated by postkidney transplantation data. Our model comprises two parts
linked by shared latent terms. On the one hand is a multivariate mixed linear
model with random effects, where a low-rank thin-plate spline function is
incorporated to collect the nonlinear behavior of the different profiles over
time. On the other hand is an infection-specific Cox model, where the dependence 
between different types of infections and the related times of infection is
through a random effect associated with each infection type to catch the within
dependence and a shared frailty parameter to capture the dependence between
infection types. We implemented the parameterization used in joint models which
uses the fitted longitudinal measurements as time-dependent covariates in a
relative risk model. Our proposed model was implemented in OpenBUGS using the
MCMC approach.
