Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and
associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in
frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we
examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of
Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in 
ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24
months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled
frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during
follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of
frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores
changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change,
0.2 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity
(0.6 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7
points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher
frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores
(-1.1 points per g/dl; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition,
patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become
frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction
in frailty score (95% confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the
underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included
serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of
hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and
hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at
any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic
rate was not independently associated with frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores,
with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of 
inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening
frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or 
posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis and
is traditionally measured using tools that assess physical impairment. Alternate 
measurement tools highlight cognitive and functional domains, requiring
clinician, patient, and/or caregiver input. In this study, we compared frailty
measures for incident dialysis patients that incorporate patient, clinician, and 
caregiver perspectives with an aim to contrast the measured prevalence of frailty
using tools derived from different conceptual frameworks.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients was conducted
between February 2014 and June 2015. Frailty was assessed at dialysis onset
using: 1) modified definition of Fried Phenotype (Dialysis Morbidity Mortality
Study definition, DMMS); 2) Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS); 3) Frailty Assessment
Care Planning Tool (provides CFS grading, FACT-CFS); and 4) Frailty Index (FI).
Measures were compared via correlation and sensitivity/specificity analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 98 patients participated (mean age of 61 ± 14 years).
Participants were primarily Caucasian (91%), male (58%), and the majority started
on hemodialysis (83%). The median score for both the CFS and FACT-CFS was 4
(interquartile range of 3-5). The mean FI score was 0.31 (standard
deviation ± 0.16). The DMMS identified 78% of patients as frail. The FACT-CFS
demonstrated highest correlation (r = 0.71) with the FI, while the DMMS was most 
sensitive (97%, 100%) and a CFS ≥ 5 most specific (100%, 77%) at corresponding FI
cutoff values (>0.21, >0.45).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessments of incident dialysis patients that include
clinician, caregiver and patient perspectives have moderate to strong correlation
with the FI. At specified FI cutoff values, the FACT-CFS and DMMS are highly
sensitive measures of frailty. The CFS and FACT-CFS may represent viable
alternative screening tools in dialysis patients.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem that is associated
with excess morbidity, mortality, and health resource utilization. The
progression of CKD is defined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and
leads to a variety of metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypertension,
anemia, and mineral bone disorder. Lower glomerular filtration rate also bears a 
strong relationship with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, end-stage
renal disease, and death. Patterns of CKD progression include linear and
nonlinear trajectories, but kidney function can remain stable for years in some
individuals. Addressing modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD is
needed to attenuate its associated morbidity and mortality. Developing effective 
risk prediction models for CKD progression is critical to identify patients who
are more likely to benefit from interventions and more intensive monitoring.
Accurate risk-prediction algorithms permit systems to best align health care
resources with risk to maximize their effects and efficiency while guiding
overall decision making.

BACKGROUND: Patient-centered quality outcomes such as disposition after surgery
are increasingly being scrutinized. Preoperative factors predictive of nonhome
discharge (DC) may identify at-risk patients for targeted interventions. This
study examines the association among preoperative risk factors, frailty, and
nonhome DC after elective vascular surgery procedures in patients living at home.
METHODS: The 2011-2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was
queried to identify all home-dwelling patients who underwent elective vascular
procedures (endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair, suprainguinal and
infrainguinal bypasses, peripheral endovascular interventions, carotid
endarterectomy, and stent). Preoperative frailty was measured using the modified 
frailty index (mFI; derived from Canadian Study of Health and Aging). Univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the
association of frailty and nonhome DC.
RESULTS: Of 15,843 home-dwelling patients, 1,177 patients (7.4%) did not return
home postoperatively. Frailty (mFI > 0.25) conferred a significantly increased
2-fold risk of nonhome DC disposition for each procedure type. Frailty, female
gender, open procedures, increasing age, end-stage renal disease, and occurrence 
of any postoperative complication were associated with increased risk of nonhome 
DC. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, frailty increased the odds of
nonhome DC by 60% (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4-1.8) after
adjusting for other covariates. In the presence of complications, the risk of
nonhome DC was 27.5% in frail versus 16.5% in nonfrail patients (P < 0.001). In
the absence of complications, although absolute risk was lower, frail patients
were nearly twice as likely to not return home (frail 5.5% vs. nonfrail 2.75%,
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail home-dwelling patients undergoing elective vascular procedures
are at high risk of not returning home after surgery. Preoperative frailty
assessment appears to hold potential for counseling regarding postsurgery
disposition and DC planning.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With aging of the general population, patients who
enter dialysis therapy will more frequently have geriatric impairments and a
considerable comorbidity burden. The most vulnerable among these patients might
benefit from conservative therapy. Whether assessment of geriatric impairments
would contribute to the decision-making process of dialysis initiation is
unknown.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A systematic Medline and Embase
search was performed on December 1, 2015 to identify studies assessing the
association between risk of mortality or hospitalization and one or more
geriatric impairments at the start of dialysis therapy, including impairment of
cognitive function, mood, performance status or (instrumental) activities of
daily living, mobility (including falls), social environment, or nutritional
status.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were identified that assessed one or more geriatric
impairments with respect to prognosis. The quality of most studies was moderate. 
Only seven studies carried out an analysis of elderly patients (≥70 years old).
Malnutrition and frailty were systematically assessed, and their relation with
mortality was clear. In addition, cognitive impairment and functional outcomes at
the initiation of dialysis were related to an increased mortality in most
studies. However, not all studies applied systematic assessment tools, thereby
potentially missing relevant impairment. None of the studies applied a geriatric 
assessment across multiple domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric impairment across multiple domains at dialysis initiation 
is related to poor outcome. However, information in the elderly is sparse, and a 
systematic approach of multiple domains with respect to poor outcome has not been
performed. Because a geriatric assessment has proved useful in predicting outcome
in other medical fields, its potential role in the ESRD population should be the 
subject of future research.

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with
destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial
cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However,
surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis
rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on
hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal
kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree
decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior
instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to
adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical 
motion.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

Inequalities between genders in access to transplantation have been demonstrated.
We aimed to validate this gender inequality in a large pediatric population and
to investigate its causes. This cohort study included 6454 patients starting
renal replacement therapy before 18 years old, in 35 countries participating in
the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology/European Renal
Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry. We used
cumulative incidence competing risk and proportional hazards frailty models to
study the time to receive a transplant and hierarchical logistic regression to
investigate access to preemptive transplantation. Girls had a slower access to
renal transplantation because of a 23% lower probability of receiving preemptive 
transplantation. We found a longer follow-up time before renal replacement
therapy in boys compared with girls despite a similar estimated glomerular
filtration rate at first appointment. Girls tend to progress faster toward
end-stage renal disease than boys, which may contribute to a shorter time
available for pretransplantation workup. Overall, medical factors explained only 
70% of the gender difference. In Europe, girls have less access to preemptive
transplantation for reasons that are only partially related to medical factors.
Nonmedical factors such as patient motivation and parent and physician attitudes 
toward transplantation and organ donation may contribute to this inequality. Our 
study should raise awareness for the management of girls with renal diseases.

BACKGROUND: The elderly form an expanding proportion of patients with chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide. The increased physiological
frailty and functional morbidity associated with the aging process pose unique
challenges when planning optimal management of an older patient needing renal
replacement therapy (RRT).
AIMS: This position paper discusses current evidence regarding the optimal
management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly with an emphasis on
hemodialysis since it is the most common modality used in older patients. Further
research is needed to define relevant patient-reported outcome measures for
end-stage renal disease including functional assessments and psychological
impacts of various forms of RRT. For those older patients who have opted for
dialysis treatment, it is important to study the strategies that encourage
greater uptake of home-based dialysis therapies and optimal vascular access.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of advanced chronic kidney disease in the elderly can
be challenging but also extremely rewarding. The key issue is adopting a
patient-focused and individualized approach that seeks to achieve the best
outcomes based on a comprehensive holistic assessment of what is important to the
patient.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

Body composition in chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

AIM: Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on its impact
on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different
self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these patients has not been
attempted before.
METHODS: A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural centre was
recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered
to these patients. Clinical and dialysis-related laboratory parameters were
collected. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis
complications were performed, and variables demonstrating significant
correlations were entered into multivariate regression models to determine their 
independent associations.
RESULTS: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail
Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and
Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic
dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire showed significant association with each
other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated
significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher Liu's
comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and creatinine
levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The other five
questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important
dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis
identified an independently negative association between serum albumin and the
simple FRAIL scale results (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study establishing the utility of different
self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients.
The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a closer relationship with
dialysis-related complications.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Testosterone among Patients with End-Stage Renal
Disease.

Bao Y(1), Johansen KL.

The prevalence of low testosterone level is particularly high among patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been associated with mortality. In
populations without ESRD, low testosterone level has also been associated with a 
number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low
muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty. However, there
is controversy regarding what constitutes low testosterone level in the aging
population and at what level replacement therapy with testosterone is indicated. 
There are no randomized controlled trials investigating long-term outcomes of
testosterone replacement therapy in populations with or without ESRD. Available
trial results suggest equivocal improvements in sexual function. Muscle mass and 
bone mineral density appear to improve, but results in physical function and
performance are mixed and there are no data on fracture prevention. Some recent
data suggest harm when testosterone was given to men with limited mobility.
Finally, there is little evidence that testosterone adds to existing
erythropoietin agents in the treatment of anemia in ESRD. Due to lack of evidence
supporting long-term use of testosterone, the authors recommend against the
routine use of testosterone in ESRD patients with low testosterone levels.
Testosterone treatment can be considered in those with low bone mass and total
testosterone level <200 ng/dl, or in younger patients with sexual complaints with
total testosterone level lower than the reference range. It is important to
engage patients in discussion of risks and benefits before initiating
testosterone therapy; testosterone therapy should be discontinued if the intended
treatment effect is not observed after short-term use.

Hemodialysis (HD) is routinely offered to patients with end-stage renal disease
in the United States who are ineligible for other renal replacement modalities.
The frequency of HD among the US population is greater than all other countries, 
except Taiwan and Japan. In US, patients are often dialyzed irrespective of age, 
comorbidities, prognosis, or decision-making capacity. Determination of when
patients can no longer dialyze is variable and can be dialysis-center specific.
Determinants may be related to progressive comorbidities and frailty, mobility or
access issues, patient self-determination, or an inability to tolerate the
treatment safely for any number of reasons (e.g., hypotension, behavioral
issues). Behavioral issues may impact the safety of not only patients themselves,
but also those around them. In this article the authors present the case of an
elderly patient on HD with progressive cognitive impairment and combative
behavior placing him and others at risk of physical harm. The authors discuss the
medical, ethical, legal, and psychosocial challenges to care of such patients who
lack decision-making capacity with a focus on variable approaches by regions and 
culture. This manuscript provides recommendations and highlights resources to
assist nephrologists, dialysis personnel, ethics consultants, and palliative
medicine teams in managing such patients to resolve conflict.

BACKGROUND: A well-accepted definition of frailty includes measurements of
physical performance, which may limit its clinical utility.
STUDY DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, we compared prevalence and patient
characteristics based on a frailty definition that uses self-reported function to
the classic performance-based definition and developed a modified
self-report-based definition.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prevalent adult patients receiving hemodialysis in 14
centers around San Francisco and Atlanta in 2009-2011.
INDEX TESTS: Self-report-based frailty definition in which a score lower than 75 
on the Physical Function scale of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)
was substituted for gait speed and grip strength in the classic definition;
modified self-report definition with optimized Physical Function score cutoff
points derived in a development (one-half) cohort and validated in the other
half.
REFERENCE TEST: Performance-based frailty defined as 3 of the following: weight
loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed.
RESULTS: 387 (53%) patients were frail based on self-reported function, of whom
209 (29% of the cohort) met the performance-based definition. Only 23 (3%) met
the performance-based definition of frailty only. The self-report definition had 
90% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 54% positive predictive value, 93% negative
predictive value, and 72.5% overall accuracy. Intracellular water per kilogram of
body weight and serum albumin, prealbumin, and creatinine levels were highest
among nonfrail individuals, intermediate among those who were frail by
self-report, and lowest among those who also were frail by performance. Age,
percentage of body fat, and C-reactive protein level followed an opposite
pattern. The modified self-report definition had better accuracy (84%; 95% CI,
79%-89%) and superior specificity (88%) and positive predictive value (67%).
LIMITATIONS: Our study did not address prediction of outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the self-report-based but not the
performance-based definition of frailty may represent an intermediate phenotype. 
A modified self-report definition can improve the accuracy of a
questionnaire-based method of defining frailty.

BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides
(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and
its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we
hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between
earlier dialysis initiation and mortality.
METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis
Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident
patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for
vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization
through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the 
association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards
regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization.
RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73%.
In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with 
higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25-1.97]; P < .001) and time to first
hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45]; P < .001). While higher eGFR at
dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23]
per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically
significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the 
United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation.
Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier
initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described
association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.

BACKGROUND: The risk of herpes zoster in the dialysis population relative to the 
general population is not known. The aim of this study was to perform a
population-based cohort study to investigate the risk of herpes zoster after the 
initiation of hemodialysis therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) in Taiwan, a country with the highest incidence of ESRD in the world.
STUDY DESIGN: Matched cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health
Insurance Research Database. 843 patients who were beginning hemodialysis therapy
in 1999-2003 were included as the study cohort and 3,372 patients without ESRD
matched for age and sex were included as a comparison cohort. A multivariate
frailty Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to adjust for
confounding and compare the 6-year herpes zoster-free survival rate between these
2 cohorts.
PREDICTORS: Hemodialysis.
OUTCOMES: Herpes zoster.
RESULTS: Mean years of follow-up were 4.73 and 5.49 for the hemodialysis and
comparison cohorts, respectively. 868 patients developed herpes zoster throughout
the study period, 294 from the hemodialysis cohort and 574 from the comparison
cohort. The incidence rate of herpes zoster (73.34 events/1,000 person-year) was 
significantly higher in the hemodialysis cohort than in the control cohort (31.03
events/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for potential confounders, the
adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.72-2.27).
LIMITATIONS: We expect that some patients with mild zoster chose not to seek
medical help.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients treated with long-term hemodialysis are at
an increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population.

Physical inactivity contributes to the frailty and the decline in function that
develops over time among patients with end-stage renal disease. We assessed
physical activity among 1547 ambulatory patients new to dialysis in the United
States Renal Data System Comprehensive Dialysis Study. We used a self-reporting
Human Activity Profile that included Maximal and Adjusted Activity Scores and
compared results to established norms by age and gender. Physical activity was
found to be extremely low with scores for all age and gender categories below the
5th percentile of healthy individuals and 95% of patients had scores consonant
with low fitness. Older age, female gender, diabetes, atherosclerotic disease,
and a low level of education were associated with lower activity scores assessed 
by univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis. Higher serum albumin,
creatinine, and lower body mass index, but not hemoglobin levels, were associated
with greater physical activity. By multivariable analysis, patients on
hemodialysis using a catheter reported lower levels of physical activity compared
to those on peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis using an arteriovenous fistula, or 
with a graft. Lower Maximal and Adjusted Activity Scores were associated with
poor physical function and mental health. Hence, physical activity is
distressingly low among patients new to dialysis. Thus, strategies to enhance
activity in these patients should be explored.

Health-related quality of life outcomes in chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic dialysis have
higher mortality in the United States than in many other countries. While
increasing age, white race, male sex, and/or diabetes are considered risk factors
for survival, few studies of older dialysis patients have simultaneously
considered multiple predictor variables and their interactions. Using information
contained in the 1982 to 1986 ESRD Network 20 database for Georgia and South
Carolina, we studied hospitalizations and survival of 1,354 blacks and 965 whites
who were age 60 years or older when they began dialysis therapy. Survival time
was modeled using the Cox life-table regression method. Older blacks' median age 
at dialysis initiation was 67.4, compared with 68.7 for older whites (P = 0.001).
Blacks were more likely than whites (P < 0.001) to have hypertension-related or
diabetes-related ESRD. White patients experienced approximately 25% more
hospitalization when adjustment was made for patient-days at risk. Separate
multivariate survival models were required for patients with diabetes-related
versus non-diabetes-related ESRD. Among diabetics, mortality was higher among
whites and among patients who were older when they began dialysis. Among patients
with non-diabetes-related ESRD, mortality was higher among patients who were
older when they began dialysis, but the age effect was much stronger for white
males. Our hospitalization and mortality data support the view that unmeasured
severity (or frailty) differences characterize white as compared with black
dialysis patients. Among non-diabetes-related ESRD patients, the age effect on
survival was more severe in white males than in blacks or in white females. The
high mortality we observed among older dialysis patients in Georgia and South
Carolina warrants further study; the data may in part reflect patients' lower
socioeconomic status compared with age, race, and sex-matched controls.
