The aortic valve is a semilunar valve with three leaflets, which lies at the
junction of left ventricle and aorta. It allows unidirectional blood flow from
the left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. Because of the highly
complex and sophisticated cellular and molecular functions, the thin valve
leaflet can withstand extreme mechanical and hemodynamic forces with every
cardiac cycle.[1] Various factors including age and congenital defects can
compromise the normal valvular function leading to a wide variety of
complications.[2] Although bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are the most common
congenital abnormality, congenital valve defects can range from aortic atresia
(missing or incomplete closure of aortic valves) to a sub or supra-valvular
stenosis. BAV is reported to have an incidence of 1 to 2% with a male
predominance. Lack of microfibrillar proteins during valvulogenesis has been
reported to affect the leaflet development where two leaflets are fused to form
one large leaflet. It frequently correlates with aortic abnormalities such as
aortic dilation (root, ascending and arch) and coarctation of the aorta.[3] The
bicuspid aortic valve leaflets can undergo accelerated calcific degeneration
because of abnormal hemodynamic forces. Congenital abnormalities including BAV
can lead to various valvular complications including aortic stenosis and aortic
regurgitation leading to an increased risk to infective endocarditis, which has a
reported incidence of 12 to 39% in BAV.[3] Unless severe, BAV generally remains
asymptomatic till the age of 50 to 60 years. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a narrowing 
of the valve aperture reducing the aortic valve area. Increased resistance to
blood flow and transvalvular pressure gradient causes increased left ventricle
workload causing hypertrophy. Its prevalence increases with age and can be as
high as 4.6% in people greater than age 75 years. Being the most common valvular 
disease in Europe and America, estimates are that 3.5 million people in England
alone will have AS by the year 2020.[4] Calcific degeneration leading to
stiffening and restriction motion of valve leaflet is the most common cause of
AS. Disruption of endothelium lining on the aortic side caused by increased
mechanical stress seem to be the inciting event. Posterior leaflets are
reported to be affected the most.[5] Rheumatic fever causing inflammation of the 
leaflets is still the leading cause of AS in developing countries. AS can be
asymptomatic or can cause symptoms of syncope, angina and heart
failure.[6] Severe AS is fatal with a 50% mortality at 2 years.[7] As per The
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines,
AS is graded severe when the orifice area is less than 1.0 cm, the mean gradient 
is greater than 40 mmHg or the jet velocity is greater than 4 m/s. Prognosis is
poor in symptomatic or severe cases unless the valve is replaced. Up to 30% of
patients aged > 75 do not undergo surgical valve replacement either because of
technical reasons; this may include porcelain aorta, general frailty, refusal to 
undergo surgery, and serious comorbid conditions.[8] The operative death risk for
surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is as high as 10% in patients with LV
dysfunction, chronic renal disease, and advanced age.[9] Trans-catheter aortic
valve replacement and trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR/TAVI) have
emerged as a more feasible and less risky option for patients not suitable for
surgery. Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the backflow of blood from the aorta to the
left ventricle when the valve leaflets fail to coapt. Common causes include
congenital defects, calcific degeneration, infective endocarditis, rheumatic
fever, and trauma.[10][11][12][13] Ventricular hypertrophy in chronic cases
accommodates increased volume to maintain the normal stroke volume and
end-diastolic pressure; hence, chronic AR can be asymptomatic for decades.[14] In
contrast, with acute cases of AR, ventricles do not have enough time to undergo
the needed changes such as hypertrophy to accommodate increased volumes. Because 
of decreased stroke volume, the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output
but is insufficient to meet the demand resulting in increased left atrial
pressure, pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. On physical examination, AR
murmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after
the aortic component of S (A); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal
intercostal space. It also has associations with various other murmurs including:
“Mid-systolic murmur” because of rapid ejection of an overload of blood from the 
left ventricle, “Austin Flint” murmur is mid-to-late diastolic murmur due
to partial closure of mitral valve during ventricular systole because of
regurgitant flow from aortic valve, “Cole-Cecil” is a diastolic murmur due to the
fusion of an aortic murmur with the S3 because of simultaneous filling of the
left ventricle from left atrium and AR. History of valvular surgery Dr. Theodore 
Tuffier, in 1912, used his finger to free the fused leaflets of a stenosed aortic
valve.[15] Before the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mitral valve repair
involved commissurotomy through access from the left atrial chamber. Thomas Homes
Sellors performed first pulmonary valvulotomy in 1948 by using a tenotomy
knife.[16] Charles Hufnagel developed the first artificial valve based on a
reciprocating ball and cage. It was used to prevent backflow of blood into the
ventricles due to aortic insufficiency.[17] CPB machine revolutionized the valve 
replacement in the anatomical position. Dr. Dwight Harken and his colleagues
performed the first successful aortic valve replacement. Later that year, Drs.
Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards performed mitral valve replacement.[18]
Bioprosthetic valves are closer in function to natural valves but have a limited 
life expectancy, whereas, Mechanical valves are more durable but require
anticoagulation. The choice of valves, among other factors, depends upon the
patient’s age and well-being. Mechanical heart valves are known to last for
approximately 25 years. Seventy different mechanical heart valves have been
developed since 1960.[19] Ball and cage, bi-leaflet, and tilting disc are the
common ones. Modification of the ball valve by Dr. Albert Starr and Lowell
Edwards entailed developing a cage made of lucite with a silicone elastomer ball.
The cage material was later changed to stainless steel and then cobalt-chromium
alloys. The Starr-Edward valve also has a Teflon sewing ring, which enabled
suturing into mitral and later into the aortic position.[20]  Increased
thrombogenicity has been a significant issue, for which valves underwent several 
modifications such as measures to reduce metal contact by covering the struts
with cloth and using Silastic shields. Other issues included hemolysis due to
excessive rubbing of the ball against the sewing ring and occlusion of coronary
ostia because of high profile. Despite these issues, these valves showed the
feasibility of prosthetic valve enabling Starr-Edwards to draw design criteria.
Basic points included that the valves should be chemically inert, biocompatible, 
a-traumatic to blood, and non-thrombogenic.[21]  In 1965, Kay-Shiley’s
non-rotating disc valve replaced the ball with a single disc but demonstrated
poor hemodynamics and hemolysis and was discontinued. Bjork-Shiley in 1969
developed a tilting-disc valve, which overcame the problems with the single-disc 
valve. Free rotation of disc between metal struts allows it to open by tilting at
a 60-degree angle. Bjork-Shiley replaced the flat with the convexo-concave disc
to create a larger orifice in 1975 but were the object of a recall due to
fracture of welded struts.[22]  Medtronic Hall valve developed by Dr. Karl Hall
and Robert Kaster is the most common tilting disc valve. Perforation in the
middle of the disc served as a guide and an improved tilting angle.[23] In 1977, 
St Jude Medical developed Bi-leaflet valve, which comprised two semi-circular
flaps with hinges close to the center of the orifice. Stagnation of blood flow
leading to thrombus formation around the hinge region was a problem with the
bi-leaflet valve.[15] A newly developed valve resolved this issue with a valve in
which the continuous 360-degree rotation around the central axis of the valve
ensured an even distribution of blood flow and prevent thrombus formation.[16] 
Predisposition for thrombosis, embolism, need for lifelong anticoagulation
therapy are drawbacks of mechanical valves. Bioprosthetic valves can either be an
allograft (cadaver or Ross procedure) or, a xenograft (native or pericardium).
The Ross procedure involves replacing the diseased aortic valve with the
patient’s own pulmonary valve (autograft) and replace the pulmonary valve with
aortic or pulmonary allograft. The pulmonary autograft grows with the patient and
does not induce an immunologic response. The most common xenografts are porcine
aortic valves and bovine pericardial valves. Lonescu-Shiley developed xenograft
valves by using bovine pericardium on a titanium stent in 1971 but was later
withdrawn in 1987 due to structural failure including abrasive tears because of
fabric-tissue interface and leaflet calcification. Carpentier-Edwards bovine
pericardial valve overcame those issues by making some structural modifications, 
like stitching pericardium to the inside of the fabric and using flexible stent
posts. Although biological valves have better hemodynamics compared to mechanical
valves, they have a shorter lifespan because of calcification, which stiffens the
valve leaflets. Tissues engineering, a field in regenerative medicine restores
and maintains the function of living tissues. Skin graft for burn victims is an
example. Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) are perceived to be
non-thrombogenic, and infection resistant. With advancement in material science
and culturing techniques, there is the possibility of a TEHV valve that
is capable of growing, remodeling and repairing itself as the patients grow.
Polymeric valves have been around for over 50 years, but because the earlier
versions were prone to calcification and degradation, they were not widely used
and instead only used in bridge devices like artificial hearts and left
ventricular assist devices. Besides the advantage that they can be produced in
various shapes and sizes,[17] they are known to combine the durability of
mechanical valves and the hydrodynamic function of bioprosthetic valves.[18] The 
earliest polymeric valve implanted in a 44-year-old female in 1958 at the mitral 
position was a polyurethane design with Teflon chordae
tendinae.[18][18][24] Polyurethane valves have been found to have better
hemodynamics compared to bioprosthetic valves and a lower incidence of
thrombogenicity than mechanical valves. With advances in material sciences, the
future of polymeric valves seems promising.

Death is an inevitable part of living. There are undoubtedly clinical and
psychological challenges when any individual is passing from life to death. For a
person with a long-term condition such as diabetes, these challenges can be
compounded and impact on the care and experience of both the individual and their
families and carers. It is estimated that about 500,000 people die each year in
the United Kingdom; of these approximately 75,000 will have diabetes. The vast
majority of people with diabetes who die do not do so as a result of a metabolic 
diabetes emergency such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic
state. Whilst diabetes is listed as one of the top 10 causes of death in
developed countries, death occurs more commonly as a result of cardiovascular
disease, dementia, respiratory disease, or cancer. Life-long care of people with 
diabetes centres on glycaemic management and other modifiable clinical elements
such as blood pressure, renal function, and cholesterol. These factors may become
less important to healthcare professionals caring for the individual who is
approaching the end of their life and for safety and holistic reasons clinical
targets may be made more liberal. For the person dying and their families and
carers this may be a difficult concept to accept. This article is based on the
Diabetes UK (2018) Diabetes and End of Life: Clinical Care Recommendations.
Offering a comprehensive guide to the management of diabetes through all the
stages of dying it provides information on hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia
prevention and treatment, and the care of people taking glucocorticoid therapy
with a previously known and not known diagnosis of diabetes. Controversial areas 
of care are discussed where there has been no clear consensus.

Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is rare and characterized endoscopically by
distal esophageal ulceration, blackening, and necrosis. It typically arises in
patients with multiple comorbidities who have significant systemic disease and
frailty. Specific precipitating events are variable. Evidence suggests a
multifactorial etiology likely involving esophageal ischemia in the setting of
corrosive injury from gastric contents and impaired tissue repair mechanisms. In 
the transplant setting, immunosuppression likely plays a substantial role. We
report a case of AEN in a 70-year-old man following a renal transplant.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are underrepresented in the studies concerning
anticoagulation therapy (AT) in atrial fibrillation (AF), while patients' frailty
status is lacking in most of the studies.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate AT in AF elderly patients and study the 
effect of patients' frailty status on their long-term AT.
METHODS: We conducted an observational prospective study that enrolled
consecutive AF patients (≥ 75 years) who were hospitalized in the Department of
Internal Medicine of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece from 1
June 2015 to 1 June 2016. We recorded the AT on admission and at discharge,
all-cause mortality, and hospital readmission in a follow-up period of 1 year
after hospital discharge. Frailty status was assessed by pre-established scores.
RESULTS: One hundred and four consecutive patients (49% male; median age
87 years) were enrolled, 78 (78.8%) of whom received AT at discharge. Patients
who did not receive AT at discharge had a higher HEMORR2HAGES (Hepatic or renal
disease, Ethanol abuse, Malignancy, Older age, Reduced platelet count or
function, Re-bleeding, Hypertension, Anemia, Genetic factors, Excessive fall risk
and Stroke) score (5.5 ± 1.15 vs. 4.79 ± 1.68; p = 0.032), a lower Katz score
(2.48 ± 2.23 vs. 4.08 ± 2.25; p = 0.006), and a higher Clinical Frailty Scale
score (7 ± 1.95 vs. 5.57 ± 2.05; p = 0.006). Sixty-five patients (62.5%) were
readmitted to a hospital during the follow-up period. In-hospital death occurred 
in five patients (4.8%) and 57 patients (57.6%) died within the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: A high percentage of the elderly AF patients did not receive AT, even
at discharge. Patients who did not receive AT at discharge had higher bleeding
and frailty scores. In the 1-year follow-up period after hospital discharge, high
all-cause mortality and a high number of hospital readmissions were recorded.

INTRODUCTION: Early toxic death (≤60 days of diagnosis) in elderly multiple
myeloma (MM) patients is attributable to active disease, age and co-morbidities. 
Rate of early toxic deaths is 10% with conventional chemotherapy mainly due to
infection and renal failure. Novel agents have improved MM outcome at the expense
of newer toxicity.
METHODS: We analyzed 1146 individual patient data to assess toxic deaths during
induction treatment with first-generation novel agents thalidomide, lenalidomide,
bortezomib.
RESULTS: During first-line therapy, 119/1146 patients (10%) died for any cause,
and 47/1146 (4%) due to toxicity, including 12/1146 (1%) early deaths. The
24-month cumulative incidence was 4.1% without any difference between bortezomib 
(18/503 patients, 4%) and lenalidomide (29/643patients, 5%; p = 0.31). Toxic
deaths occurred in 34/1039 (3%) patients <80 years and 13/107 (12%) patients ≥80 
years. Causes were cardiac events (28%), infections (26%) and vascular
complications (15%). In a multivariate analysis, older age and unfavorable ISS
stage increased the risk of death.
CONCLUSION: First-generation novel agents significantly reduced toxic deaths
compared to conventional chemotherapy. One third of deaths during first-line
therapy were due to cumulative drug-related toxicities, thus supportive
approaches and prevention strategies should be optimized. The higher mortality
rate for toxicity in octogenarians confirms the need for a careful frailty
assessment.

INTRODUCTION: For treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism 
(PE), rivaroxaban is given in fixed doses without routine coagulation monitoring.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: To determine whether monitoring would enhance its
benefit-risk profile, we examined whether peak and trough prothrombin time (PT)
values measured in 3797 rivaroxaban-treated patients included in the EINSTEIN DVT
and PE studies correlated with subsequent recurrent VTE and major bleeding. In
addition, we examined the stability of PT values over time and the impact of
clinical variables on PT values.
RESULTS: The mean peak PT values at months 3 and 6 or 12 were 21.9 ± 5 and
21.7 ± 6.0 s, respectively, while the mean trough PT values at months 2 and 6
were 15.1 ± 5.1 and 15.3 ± 2.9 s, respectively. Although peak and through PT
values were higher in females, and with older age, frailty, active cancer, low
body weight, impaired renal function and use of moderate to strong inhibitors of 
CYP3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein, and were lower in patients taking strong CYP 3A4
inducers, the differences were small and results were overlapping. Neither peak
nor trough PT values correlated with recurrent VTE or major bleeding.
CONCLUSIONS: PT monitoring is unlikely to improve the benefit-risk profile of
rivaroxaban in patients with DVT or PE. The study was registered at
www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00440193 (EINSTEIN-DVT) and #NCT00439777
(EINSTEIN-PE).

Heart failure (HF) represents a global pandemic health problem with a high impact
on health-care costs, affecting about 26 million adults worldwide. The overall HF
prevalence and incidence are ~2% and ~0.2% per year, respectively, in Western
countries, with half of the HF population with reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF) 
and half with preserved (HFpEF) or mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF). Sex
differences may exist in HF. More males have HFrEF or HFmrEF and an ischemic
etiology, whereas more females have HFpEF and hypertension, diastolic
dysfunction, and valvular pathologies as HF etiologies. Females are generally
older, have a higher EF, higher frequency of HF-related symptoms, and lower NYHA 
functional status. Generally, it is observed that female HF patients tend to have
more comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, anemia,
iron deficiency, renal disease, arthritis, frailty, depression, and thyroid
abnormalities. However, overall, females have better prognosis in terms of
mortality and hospitalization risk compared with men, regardless of EF. Potential
sex differences in HF characteristics may be underestimated because of the
underrepresentation of females in cardiovascular research and, in particular, the
sex imbalance in clinical trial enrollment may avoid to identify sex-specific

Ever since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in
1995, HIV infection has been linked to "metabolic" complications (insulin
resistance, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and others). Studies suggested increased 
rates of myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency, neurocognitive dysfunction, 
and fractures in HIV-postitive patients. Even long-term suppression of HIV seemed
to be accompanied by an excess of deleterious inflammation that could promote
these complications. The aims of this viewpoint paper are to summarize recent
data and to examine the possibility that the problem of aging-related morbidity
in HIV might not be as dramatic as previously believed.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frailty and depression both contribute to malnutrition and
adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, their
interaction is incompletely defined.
METHODS: We studied 178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed 
by a validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by the
Geriatric Depression Scale; nutritional status was determined by subjective
global assessment (SGA) and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS). All patients
were followed for up to 24 months for survival and hospitalization analysis.
RESULTS: There were 111 patients (62.4%) physically frail, amongst those 48
(43.2%) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without
frailty. There was an additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty
on nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty, frail but no depressive
symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin decreased in a
stepwise manner (35.8 ± 5.6, 34.9 ± 4.4, and 32.9 ± 5.3 g/L, respectively,
p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 ± 0.61, 5.41 ± 0.59, and 5.04 ± 0.77,
respectively (p< 0.0001), and MIS was 5.12 ± 2.30, 7.13 ± 3.22, and 9.48 ± 3.97, 
respectively (p< 0.0001). At 24 months, patient survival was 86.6%, 71.4%, and
62.5% for patients with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail
with depressive symptoms, respective (p=0.001). The median number of hospital
stay was 8.04 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.91 - 19.42), 14.05 (IQR 3.57 -
37.27), and 26.62 (IQR 10.65 - 61.18) days per year of follow up, respectively
(p< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Physical frailty and depressive symptoms are both common in Chinese
PD patients, and they have additive adverse effect on the nutritional status and 
clinical outcome.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cognitive and renal impairment are pervasive among elderly
frails, a high-risk, geriatric sub-population with peculiar clinical
characteristics. In a series of frail individuals with non-advanced chronic
kidney disease (CKD), we aimed at assessing the entity of functional, general
health and cognitive impairment and the possible relationship between these types
of dysfunction and the severity of renal impairment.
METHODS: 2229 geriatric subjects were screened for frailty and CKD. Severity of
CKD was assessed by eGFR (CKD-EPI formula). Frailty was established by the Fried 
Index. Functional, general health and cognitive status were assessed by validated
score measures.
RESULTS: Final analysis included 271 frail CKD subjects (162 women, 109 men).
Mean eGFR was 64.25 ± 25.04 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD
(stage 3-4) was 44%. Twenty-six percent of patients had severe cognitive
impairment, while mild and moderate impairment was found in 7 and 67% of
individuals, respectively. All subjects had poor functional and general health
status. Cognitive capacities significantly decreased across CKD stages (p for
trend < 0.0001). In fully adjusted multivariate analyses, cognitive status
remained an independent predictor of eGFR (β = 0.465; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mild-to-moderate CKD is highly pervasive among frail elderly
individuals and the severity of renal dysfunction is independently correlated
with that of cognitive impairment. Future studies are advocated to clarify
whether the combination of kidney and mental dysfunction may portend a higher
risk of worsen outcomes in this high-risk population.

A low-protein diet (LPD) can be expected to retard renal function decline in
advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including diabetic kidney
disease (DKD), and is recommended in a clinical setting. Regarding the molecular 
mechanisms of an LPD against DKD, previous animal studies have shown that an LPD 
exerts reno-protection through mainly the improvement of glomerular
hyperfiltration/hypertension due to the reduction of intraglomerular pressure. On
the other hand, we have demonstrated that an LPD, particularly a very-LPD (VLPD),
improved tubulo-interstitial damage, inflammation and fibrosis, through the
restoration of autophagy via the reduction of a mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in type 2 diabetes and obesity animal models. Thus,
based on animal studies, a VLPD may show a more beneficial effect against
advanced DKD. Previous clinical reports have also shown that a VLPD, not a
moderate LPD, slows the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with chronic
glomerular nephritis. However, there is insufficient clinical data regarding the 
beneficial effects of a VLPD against DKD. Additionally, the patients with CKD,
including DKD, are a high-risk group for malnutrition, such as protein⁻energy
wasting (PEW), sarcopenia, and frailty. Therefore, an LPD, including a VLPD,
should be prescribed to patients when the benefits of an LPD outweigh the risks, 
upon consideration of adherence, age, and nutritional status. As the future
predicts, the development of a VLPD replacement therapy without malnutrition may 
be expected for reno-protection against the advanced stages of DKD, through the
regulation of mTORC1 activity and adequate autophagy induction. However, further 
studies to elucidate detailed mechanisms by which a VLPD exerts reno-protection
are necessary.

Objective Despite centralisation of the provision of vascular care, not all areas
in England and Wales are able to offer emergency treatment for patients with
acute conditions affecting the aorta proximal to the renal arteries. While
cardiothoracic centres have made network arrangements to coordinate care for the 
repair of type A dissections, a similar plan for vascular care is lacking. This
study investigates early outcomes in patients with ruptured suprarenal aortic
aneurysm or dissection (rSRAD) transferred to a specialist centre. Methods
Retrospective observational study over a five-year period (2009-2014) assessing
outcomes of patients with ruptured sRAD diagnosed at their local hospital and
then transferred to a tertiary centre capable of offering such treatment. Results
Fifty-two patients (median age 73 years, 32 male) with rSRAD were transferred and
a further four died during transit. The mean distance of patient transfer was 35 
miles (range 4-211 miles). One patient did not undergo intervention due to
frailty and two died before reaching the operating theatre. A total of 23
patients underwent endovascular repair, 9 hybrid repair and 17 open surgery.
Median follow-up was 12 months (range 1-43 months). Complications included
paraplegia (n = 3), stroke (n = 2), type IA endoleak (n = 4); 30-day and
in-hospital mortality were 16% and 27%. For patients discharged alive from
hospital, one-year survival was 67%. Conclusions Although the number of patients 
with rSRAD is low and those who are transferred alive are a self-selecting group,
this study suggests that transfer of such patients to a specialist vascular
centre is associated with acceptable mortality rates following emergency complex 
aortic repair.

Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of
diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, 
about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years.
Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive
impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly
more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial
disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a
consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a
considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without
any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with
type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into
account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life
expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals
and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically,
overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in
particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used
with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia
are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function
are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

Objectives The clinical condition of frailty is a common problem in the elderly
population. However, the relationship between peripheral artery disease and
frailty in hemodialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to
identify the relationships between peripheral artery disease and frailty in
Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods A total of 362 chronic
hemodialysis patients who regularly visited six institutions were enrolled. To
evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty phenotype adjusted for Japanese
were used. Peripheral artery disease was defined as ankle-brachial index <0.9.
Results Of 362 patients, 62 patients (17.1%) were categorized as peripheral
artery disease group and 300 patients (82.9%) as Non-peripheral artery disease
group. The prevalence of frailty in the peripheral artery disease group was
significantly higher than in the Non-peripheral artery disease group (34% vs.
18%, P = 0.0103). Non-shunt side grip strength was significantly stronger in the 
Non-peripheral artery disease group (23.6 kg vs. 17.0 kg, P < 0.0001). Thigh
circumferences were also significantly larger in the Non-peripheral artery
disease group (41.7 cm vs. 39.7 cm, P = 0.0054). A multivariate logistic
regression analysis demonstrated that the factors independently associated with
peripheral artery disease were as follows: frailty (odds ratio = 2.06, 95%
confidence interval 1.09-3.89) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 3.74, 95% 
confidence interval 2.05-6.83). Conclusions It is concluded that peripheral
artery disease is closely associated with frailty in hemodialysis patients.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcopenia and muscle weakness contribute to fragility and
limit exercise tolerance among patients with CKD. This review focuses on the role
of reduction in mitochondrial mass and function in the myopathy associated with
CKD, causes for these muscle mitochondrial abnormalities, and potential
therapeutic interventions that may improve mitochondrial biogenesis and function 
as well as skeletal muscle function and performance in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial structure, function, and
composition have been shown in both experimental models and patients with CKD. A 
significant reduction in mitochondrial respiratory function and an increase in
mitochondrial complex 1 enzyme activity has been demonstrated in the muscle
tissue of male Sprague-Dawley rats following 5/6 nephrectomy. These changes were 
associated with a substantial reduction in skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass. In
patients with CKD, in-vivo magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy show
significantly elevated resting skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and lower mean 
mitochondrial coupling ratio indicating disrupted muscle mitochondrial metabolism
and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Skeletal muscle biopsies from
patients with advanced CKD show lower mitochondrial volume density and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number than controls.
SUMMARY: Advanced CKD is associated with decreased exercise capacity, skeletal
muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. Impaired mitochondrial respiratory function,
reduced muscle mitochondrial mass, and decreased energy production in skeletal
muscle play a critical role in this 'acquired mitochondrial myopathy' of CKD. It 
is reasonable, therefore, to develop therapeutic interventions that enhance
mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as skeletal muscle function and
performance in patients with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a multifactorial geriatric syndrome characterized by
progressive decline in health and associated with decreased muscle mass,
strength, and functional capacity. Resistance training (RT) combined with protein
or amino acids supplementation has been shown to be promising for mitigating
age-related impairments.
AIM: To investigate the chronic effects of different strategies of protein and
derivatives supplementation in association with RT on selected health-related
parameters in pre-frail and frail elderly.
METHODS: This is a series of double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group clinical trials. Volunteers will be divided into nine groups,
comprising four different sub-studies evaluating the effects of: isolated leucine
supplementation (study 1); protein source (whey vs. soy - study 2); combination
of whey protein and creatine (study 3); and sexual dimorphism on the response to 
protein intake and RT (males vs. females - study 4). Muscle cross-sectional area,
fiber cross-sectional area, body composition, lower-limb maximal dynamic and
isometric strength, functionality, lipid profile, biochemical parameters, renal
function, quality of life, and nutritional status will be assessed before and
after a 16-week intervention period. Data will be tested for normality and a
mixed-model for repeated measures will be conducted to assess within- and
between-group effects of the intervention on the dependent variables. Confidence 
intervals (95%), effect sizes, and relative changes will also be determined, with
significance set at p < 0.05.

The age of patients presenting with complex arrhythmias is increasing. Frailty is
a multifaceted syndrome characterized by an increased vulnerability to stressors 
and a decreased ability to maintain homeostasis. The prevalence of frailty is
associated with age. The aims of this European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) EP
Wire survey were to evaluate the proportion of patients with frailty and its
influence on the clinical management of arrhythmias. A total of 41
centres-members of the EHRA Electrophysiology Research Network-in 14 European
countries completed the web-based questionnaire in June 2017. Patients over
70 years represented 53% of the total treated population, with the proportion of 
frail elderly individuals reaching approximately 10%; 91.7% of the responding
centres reported treating frail subjects in the previous year. The respondents
usually recognized frailty based on the presence of problems of mobility,
nutrition, and cognition and inappropriate loss of body weight and muscle mass.
Renal failure, dementia, disability, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, falls,
and cancer were reported to characterize the elderly frail individuals. Atrial
fibrillation was considered the prevalent arrhythmia associated with frailty by
72% of the responding centres, and for stroke prevention, non-vitamin K
antagonist oral anticoagulants were preferred. None of the respondents considered
withholding the prevention of thrombo-embolic events in subjects with a history
of falls. All participants have agreed that cardiac resynchronization therapy
exerts positive effects including improvement in cardiac, physical, and cognitive
performance and quality of life. The majority of respondents preferred an
Arrhythmia Team to manage this special population of elderly patients, and many
would like having a simple tool to quickly assess the presence of frailty to
guide their decisions, particularly on the use of complex cardiac implantable
electrical devices (CIEDs). In conclusion, the complex clinical condition in
frail patients presenting with arrhythmias warrants an integrated
multidisciplinary approach both for the management of rhythm disturbances and for
the decision on using CIEDs.

Age is the most important risk factor for the occurrence of cancer, and a
declining mortality from heart disease and other non-cancer causes leaves an
older population that is at high risk of developing cancer. Choosing the optimal 
treatment for older cancer patients may be a challenge. Firstly, older age and
associated factors such as comorbidities, functional limitations, and cognitive
impairment are risk factors for adverse effects of cancer treatment. Secondly,
older patients are often excluded from clinical trials, and current clinical
guidelines rarely address how to manage cancer in patients who have comorbidities
or functional limitations. The importance of incorporating frailty assessment
into the preoperative evaluation of older surgical patients has received
increasing attention over the last 10 years. Furthermore, studies that include
endpoints such as functional status, cognitive status, and quality of life beyond
the standard endpoints, i.e. postoperative morbidity and mortality, are starting 
to emerge. This review looks at recent evidence regarding geriatric assessment
and frailty in older surgical cancer patients and provides a summary of newer
studies in colorectal, liver, pancreatic, and gynecological cancer and renal and 
central nervous system tumors.

Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with higher mortality.
We aimed to identify the baseline predictors of in-hospital mortality among
elderly patients with non-valvular AF (NVAF) hospitalised for any reason.
METHODS: Observational, prospective and multicentre study was carried out on
patients with NVAF over the age of 75, who had been admitted for any acute
medical condition to Internal Medicine departments in Spain.
RESULTS: We evaluated 804 patients with a mean age of 85±5.1years, of which 53.9%
were females. During the hospitalization 10.1% (n=81) of the patients died. The
patients who died were older, had a greater percentage of institutionalization,
worse previous basic functional status (Barthel Index), worse cognitive
performance at admission and greater proportion of frailty and sarcopenia.
Logistic regression multivariate analysis identified that the strongest
determinants of in-hospital mortality were the baseline functional status
(Barthel Index) (OR for total dependency 4.73, 95% CI 2.32-9.63), and admissions 
for stroke (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.41-8.90) and acute renal failure (OR 1.93, 95% CI
1.12-3.32).
CONCLUSION: The overall in-hospital mortality of elderly patients with NVFA is
high. Among all factors evaluated in the global geriatric assessment the baseline
functional status was the strongest predictor for in-hospital mortality on this
population.

BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness is a risk factor for mortality in hemodialysis (HD)
patients. Muscle strength measurements are routinely used as a screening tool but
depend on patient cooperation and motivation. We wished to determine whether
measuring maximal voluntary muscle strength was affected by patient self-reported
distress.
METHODS: We measured pinch strength (PS) and handgrip strength (HGS) in 382 adult
HD patients with a corresponding self-reported distress thermometer (DT) scores. 
Postdialysis body composition measurements were made using multifrequency
bioelectrical assessments and patients assessed for frailty.
RESULTS: Mean age was 66.4 ± 14.9 years, with 238 males (62%), 48% diabetic, and 
dialysis vintage 36 (15-75) months. The mean DT score was 4.4 ± 3.3, with a
frailty score of 4.6 ± 1.5. On multivariable analysis, DT scores were associated 
with frailty (β = 0.35, P = .003), prescription of aspirin for cardiac disease (β
= 1.0, P = .004), lean body mass (β = 0.04, P = .004), and negatively with age (β
= -0.05, P < .001), hematocrit (β = -8.2, P = .004), and maximum PS (β = -1.4, P 
= .003).
CONCLUSION: Paradoxically higher self-reported DT scores were associated with
younger age and lean body mass. As such, younger healthier, rather than more
comorbid, patients may have greater expectations for their health and therefore
report more distress. We found no association between DT scores and HGS, and as
such, although HGS is a voluntary test, it appears to be a robust test
independent of patient stresses. However, PS was lower in patients with higher DT
scores, and as such, greater care may be required in interpreting these
measurements.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is highly prevalent in the dialysis population and is 
associated with mortality. Recent studies have suggested that other dialysis
outcomes are compromised in frail individuals. While we do not yet have a
consensus as to the best measure of frailty, identification of these poor
outcomes and their magnitude of association with frailty will help improve
prognostication, allow for earlier interventions, and improve provider-to-patient
communication.
RECENT FINDINGS: The most widely used assessment of frailty is Fried's physical
performance criteria. However, regardless of assessment method, frailty remains
highly associated with mortality. More recently, frailty has been associated with
falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, vascular access failure, and poor quality
of life. Recent large cohort studies provide strong evidence that frailty
assessment can provide important prognostic information for providers and
patients both before and after initiation of dialysis. Trials aimed at improving 
frailty are limited and show the promise of augmenting quality of life, although 
more studies are needed to firmly establish mortality benefits.
SUMMARY: We underscore the importance of frailty as a prognostic indicator and
identify other recently established consequences of frailty. Widespread adoption 
of frailty assessment remains limited and researchers continue to find ways of
simplifying the data collection process. Timely and regular assessment of frailty
may allow for interventions that can mitigate the onset of poor outcomes and
identify actionable targets for dialysis providers.

Update on pharmacological treatment of acute coronary syndrome without persistent
ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in the elderly.

The increase in cardiovascular disease prevalence with ageing has been attributed
to several age-related changes such as changes in the vascular wall elasticity,
the coagulation and haemostatic system and endothelial dysfunction, among other
causes. There is a 50% increased mortality risk per 10-year increase in age
starting at 65 years old. Here, we aimed to discuss pharmacological treatment in 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without persistent ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction in the elderly. The main aim of ACS treatment in elderly people is at 
preventing ischemia, myocardial damage and complications. A meta-analysis
suggests that invasive revascularization therapy is probably most useful in older
patients. Dual antiplatelet therapy is currently the standard of care post-ACS.
Platelet P2Y12 inhibitors are among the most commonly used medications worldwide,
due to their established benefits in the treatment and prevention of arterial
thrombosis. The main recommendation is to tailor antithrombotic treatment,
considering body weight, renal function (Class I, level C) and careful evaluation
of life expectancy, comorbidities, risk/benefit profile, quality of life and
frailty when invasive strategies are considered (Class IIa, level A) on top of
the different recommendations given for a general non ST elevation ACS
population. It is obvious that potent P2Y12 inhibitors will continue to play an
important role in pharmacological treatment for elderly ACS patients in the
future.

BACKGROUND: Aortic valve replacement is a high-risk surgery (3%-5%, 30-day
mortality) performed on approximately 30,000 elderly patients a year in the
United States. Currently, preoperative risk assessment is based on a composite of
medical examination and a subjective evaluation for frailty ("eyeball test").
Objective frailty assessment using validated indices has the potential to improve
risk stratification. The purpose of this study was to (1) establish whether
frailty can predict 30-day mortality and composite morbidity in patients
undergoing aortic valve replacement and (2) compare the predictive ability of 3
frailty indices in this population.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study of 3088 patients 65 years
old and older undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery (based on current
procedure terminology codes) between the years 2006 and 2012 extracted from the
American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
database. Frailty was assessed using the modified frailty index, risk analysis
index, and Ganapathi indices. Outcomes measured were 30-day mortality and
composite morbidity (myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism,
pneumonia, reintubation, renal insufficiency, coma >24 hours, urinary tract
infections, sepsis, deep vein thrombosis, deep wound surgical site infection,
superficial site infection, and reoperation).
RESULTS: Frailty was a better predictor of mortality than morbidity, and it was
not markedly different among any of the 3 indices. Frailty was associated with an
increased risk of 30-day mortality and longer lengths of stay.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty can predict mortality in patients undergoing aortic valve
replacement. Choice of frailty index does not make a difference in this patient
population.

To assess whether biopsy-guided selection of kidneys from very old brain-dead
donors enables more successful transplantations, the authors of this multicenter,
observational study compared graft survival between 37 recipients of 1 or 2
histologically evaluated kidneys from donors older than 80 years and 198
reference-recipients of non-histologically evaluated single grafts from donors
aged 60 years and younger (transplantation period: 2006-2013 at 3 Italian
centers). During a median (interquartile range) of 25 (13-42) months, 2
recipients (5.4%) and 10 reference-recipients (5.1%) required dialysis (crude and
donor age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.55
[0.34-7.12], P = .576 and 1.41 [0.10-19.54], P = .798, respectively). Shared
frailty analyses confirmed similar outcomes in a 1:2 propensity score study
comparing recipients with 74 reference-recipients matched by center, year, donor,
and recipient sex and age. Serum creatinine was similar across groups during
84-month follow-up. Recipients had remarkably shorter waiting times than did
reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (7.5 [4.0-19.5] vs 36
[19-56] and 40 [24-56] months, respectively, P < .0001 for both comparisons).
Mean (± SD) kidney donor risk index was 2.57 ± 0.32 in recipients vs 1.09 ± 0.24 
and 1.14 ± 0.24 in reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients
(P < .0001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were similar across groups.
Biopsy-guided allocation of kidneys from octogenarian donors permits further
expansion of the donor organ pool and faster access to a kidney transplant,
without increasing the risk of premature graft failure.

Prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide principally
among the elderly population many of whom will eventually need renal replacement 
therapy. The relationship between frailty and CKD in the elderly population has
been recognized. However, studies concentrating on frailty in pre-dialysis
patients are limited. CKD predisposes to frailty through many potential
mechanisms; anemia, bone mineral disease, oxidative stress, and malnutrition
which in turn lead to progression of CKD culminating in a vicious cycle.
Identifying potential causes of frailty in elderly pre-dialysis patients and
recognizing individuals at risk should be an area of focus to nephrologists and
researchers. Modalities that may improve frailty in elderly pre-dialysis patients
such as treatment of anemia and bone mineral disease may improve outcome.
However, this has not been established and further research is needed. The aim of
this review is to address the importance of recognizing frailty in elderly
pre-dialysis patients using simple tools and describing its implications on
clinical outcome.

BACKGROUND: To explore relevant associations between deviations in linear and
nonlinear heart rate variability (HRV) scores, and short-term morbidity and
mortality in patients undergoing hip-surgery after a fracture.
METHODS: 165 patients with hip fractures being admitted for surgery at two
hospitals were included in a prospective cohort study. A short-term ECG was
recorded within 24 hours of arrival. 15 patients had to be excluded due to
insufficient quality of the ECG recordings. 150 patients were included in the
final analysis. Linear parameters were calculated in time domain: standard
deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences
(rMSSD); and frequency domain: Total Power (TP), High Frequency Power (HF), Low
Frequency Power (LF), Very Low Frequency Power (VLF), and the ratio of LF/HF.
Postoperative outcome was evaluated at the time of discharge. This included
occurrence of pneumonia, overall infection rate, stroke, myocardial infarction,
and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Patients experiencing complications had significantly lower rMSSD (p =
0.04), and TP (p = 0.03) preoperatively. Postoperative infections were predicted 
by decreased VLF preoperatively (p = 0.04). There was a significant association
between pneumonia and LF/HF<1 (p = 0.03). The likelihood ratio to develop
pneumonia when LF/HF < 1 was 6,1.
CONCLUSION: HRV seems to reflect the general frailty of the patient with hip
fracture and might be used to identify patients in need of increased surveillance
or prophylactic treatment.

BACKGROUND: Frailty has been increasingly used as a prognostic indicator for
various surgical operations. Patients with peripheral arterial disease represent 
a cohort of population with advanced medical comorbidities. The aim of this study
is to correlate the postoperative outcomes after lower extremity bypass surgery
with preoperative modified frailty index (mFI).
METHODS: Using 2010 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program database, patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial bypass
surgery were identified. mFI with 11 variables, based on the Canadian Study of
Health and Aging Frailty Index, was utilized. Based on mFI score, the patients
were divided into 4 groups: group 1 (mFI score: 0-0.09), group 2 (mFI score:
0.18-0.27), group 3 (mFI score: 0.36-0.45), and group 4 (mFI score: 0.54-0.63). A
bivariate and multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 4,704 patients (64% males and 36% females) underwent
infrainguinal arterial bypass. Mean age was 67.9 ± 11.7 years. Distribution of
patients based on mFI was as follows: group 1: 14.6%, group 2: 55.9%, group 3:
26.9%, and group 4: 2.6%. Increase in mFI was associated with higher mortality
rates. Incidence of mortality for group 1 was 0.6%; for group 2, it was 1.4%; for
group 3, it was 4%; and for group 4, it was 7.4%. Likewise, the incidence of
other postoperative complications such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke,
progressive renal failure, and graft failure was significantly high among
patients with high mFI scores. Following factors were associated with increased
risk of mortality: high mFI score, black race, dialysis dependency, postoperative
renal insufficiency, MI, and postoperative acute renal failure.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the mFI can be used as a valuable tool 
to identify patients at a higher risk for developing postoperative complications 
after lower extremity revascularization. For patients with mFI score of
0.54-0.63, the risk of mortality and complications increases significantly. mFI
can be used as a useful screening tool to identify patients who are at a high
risk for developing complications.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A geriatric assessment is an appropriate method for
identifying frail elderly patients. In CKD, it may contribute to optimize
personalized care. However, a geriatric assessment is time consuming. The purpose
of our study was to compare easy to apply frailty screening tools with the
geriatric assessment in patients eligible for dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 123 patients on
incident dialysis ≥65 years old were included <3 weeks before to ≤2 weeks after
dialysis initiation, and all underwent a geriatric assessment. Patients with
impairment in two or more geriatric domains on the geriatric assessment were
considered frail. The diagnostic abilities of six frailty screening tools were
compared with the geriatric assessment: the Fried Frailty Index, the Groningen
Frailty Indicator, Geriatric8, the Identification of Seniors at Risk, the
Hospital Safety Program, and the clinical judgment of the nephrologist. Outcome
measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
predictive value.
RESULTS: In total, 75% of patients were frail according to the geriatric
assessment. Sensitivity of frailty screening tools ranged from 48% (Fried Frailty
Index) to 88% (Geriatric8). The discriminating features of the clinical judgment 
were comparable with the other screening tools. The Identification of Seniors at 
Risk screening tool had the best discriminating abilities, with a sensitivity of 
74%, a specificity of 80%, a positive predictive value of 91%, and a negative
predictive value of 52%. The negative predictive value was poor for all tools,
which means that almost one half of the patients screened as fit (nonfrail) had
two or more geriatric impairments on the geriatric assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: All frailty screening tools are able to detect geriatric impairment 
in elderly patients eligible for dialysis. However, all applied screening tools, 
including the judgment of the nephrologist, lack the discriminating abilities to 
adequately rule out frailty compared with a geriatric assessment.

BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that in the very elderly dialysis patients in the
United States, institutionalization in nursing homes would increase mortality in 
addition to age alone.
METHODS: Incident dialysis patients from 2001 to 2008 above the age of 70 were
included. Patients above 70 were categorized into 4 groups according to age as
70-75, 76-80, 81-85, and >85 years and further divided into institutionalized and
noninstitutionalized. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to assess patient
survival.
RESULTS: A total of 349,440 patients were identified above the age of 70 at the
time of initiation of dialysis. For institutionalized patients, the mean survival
was significantly lower, 1.71 ± 0.03 years for those in the age range 70-75, 1.44
± 0.02 years for those in the age range 76-80, 1.25 ± 0.02 years for those in the
age range 81-85, and 1.04 ± 0.02 for those in the >85 years age group (p =
0.0001). The hazard ratio for mortality in institutionalized elderly patients on 
dialysis was 1.80 ([95% CI 1.77-1.83]; p = 0.0001). After adjustment for other
variables (multivariate Cox regression), to be institutionalized was still an
independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.57 [95% CI
1.54-1.60]; p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: There was increased mortality in institutionalized elderly patients
as compared to noninstutionalized elderly patients in the same age group. In
accordance with the increased frailty and decreased benefits of therapies in the 
very elderly, especially in those with additional co-morbidities besides age,
palliative and end-of-life care should be considered.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing recognition that decreased reserve in multiple
organ systems, known as accumulated deficits (AD), may better stratify
perioperative risk than traditional risk indices. We hypothesized that an AD
model would predict both perioperative adverse events and long-term survival
after carotid endarterectomy (CEA), particularly important in asymptomatic
patients.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing CEA between 1st January 2000 and 31st
December 2010 were retrospectively identified. Seven of the deficit items from
the Canadian Study of Health and Aging-frailty index (coronary disease, renal
insufficiency, pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, heart failure,
hypertension, and diabetes) were tabulated for each patient. Predictors of
perioperative and long-term outcomes were evaluated using regression analysis.
RESULTS: About 1,782 CEAs in 1,496 patients (mean age: 71.3 ± 9.3 years, 56.3%
male, 35.4% symptomatic) were included. The risk of major adverse events (stroke,
death, or myocardial infarction) at 30 days for patients with ≤3 deficits was
2.53% vs. 8.81% for patients with ≥4 deficits (P < 0.001). For patients with ≥5
deficits, the risk was 15.18%. Each additional deficit increased the odds of a
30-day major adverse event and hospital stay >2 days by 1.64 (P < 0.001) and 1.15
(P < 0.001), respectively. In multivariate analysis, the presence of ≥4 deficits 
was more predictive of perioperative major adverse events (odds ratio [OR] =
3.62, P < 0.001) than symptomatology within 6 months (OR = 1.57, P = 0.08) or
octogenarian status (OR = 2.00, P = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed
significantly decreased survival over time with accumulating deficits
(P < 0.001). Patients with ≥4 deficits have a hazards ratio for death of 2.6
compared to patients with ≤3 deficits (P < 0.001). Overall survival is estimated 
at 79.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77-0.82) at 5 years in patients with ≤3
deficits versus 52.4% (95% CI: 0.46-0.58) in patients with ≥4 deficits,
respectively. In subgroup analysis of asymptomatic patients, 5-year survival for 
octogenarian male patients with ≥4 deficits was only 26.8%. For asymptomatic
males aged 70-79 years with ≥4 deficits, 5-year survival was 59.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: An AD model is more predictive of perioperative adverse events after
CEA than age or symptomatic status. This model remains predictive of long-term
survival. In asymptomatic male octogenarians with 4 or more AD, 5-year survival
is severely limited.

Renal disease is a common health condition that leads to loss of physical
function, frailty, and premature loss of independence in addition to other severe
comorbidities and increased mortality. Increased levels of physical activity and 
initiation of exercise training is recommended in the current guidelines for all 
patients with renal disease, but participation and adherence rates are low. The
barriers to exercise and physical activity in patients with renal disease are not
well defined and currently based on patient provider perception and opinion.
There have been no published reviews that have synthesized published findings on 
patient reported barriers to exercise. This integrative literature review
therefore aimed to identify the current understanding of patient reported
barriers to regular exercise. This integrative review found that patient
perceived barriers to exercise are not consistent with the barriers that have
been identified by renal disease specialists and healthcare providers, which were
disinterest, lack of motivation, and being incapable of exercise. The patient
reported barriers identified through this review were complex and diverse, and
the most frequently reported patient perceived barrier to exercise was low energy
levels and fatigue. It is clear that additional research to identify patient
perceived barriers to exercise is needed and that patient directed interventions 
to address these barriers should be developed. This integrative review provides
information to the interdisciplinary nephrology team that can be used to tailor
their assessment of barriers to exercise and provide exercise education for
patients with renal disease.

OBJECTIVES: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been implemented
into the care of elderly patients suffering from severe symptomatic aortic
stenosis. However, data on long-term follow-up are sparse and predictors of
long-term mortality need to be evaluated to better select patients. Therefore, we
aimed to analyse predictors of 5-year mortality after TAVI.
METHODS: We analysed data from the German Transcatheter Aortic Valve
Interventions-Registry. Each of the 27 participating hospitals agreed to include 
all consecutive TAVI patients at their institution. Out of 1444 patients treated 
with TAVI, 1378 patients had a follow-up of at least 4.5 years (completeness
95.4%). Endpoint for this analysis was 5-year survival. Cox regression analysis
was used to determine risk factors associated with this endpoint.
RESULTS: Patients who died were compared with survivors. The two groups showed
multiple differences in patient characteristics, indications for interventions,
preinterventional, as well as interventional characteristics and
postinterventional events. Calculated 1-year mortality was 21.8% and 5-year
mortality 59.1%. A higher logistic EuroScore was associated with a lower 5-year
survival, being 45.5% in patients with a logistic EuroScore of <20%, 34.5% in
those with 20% to 40% and 28.4% in patients with a logistic EuroScore >40%. Cox
proportional hazard analysis revealed the following independent predictors of
5-year mortality: female gender (HR =0.66, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.77, p<0.0001), renal 
failure (HR=1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.69, p<0.0001), prior mitral regurgitation ≥II°
(HR=1.42, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.65, p<0.0001), residual aortic regurgitation ≥II°
(HR=1.52, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.85, p<0.0001), atrial fibrillation (HR=1.38, 95% CI
1.18 to 1.64, p=0.0001), low gradient aortic stenosis (HR=1.48, 95% CI 1.19 to
1.84, p=0.0004), prior decompensation (HR=1.32, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.54, p=0.0006),
frailty (HR=1.31, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.58, p=0.004), surgical TAVI (HR=1.42, 95% CI
1.12 to 1.80, p=0.004), age (by year) (HR=1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03, p=0.006),
prior myocardial infarction (HR=1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.57, p=0.009), urgent TAVI 
(HR=1.25, 95% CI 1.04 to 51, p=0.020) and diabetes mellitus (HR=1.20, 95% CI 1.02
to 1.40, p=0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: These data from the early TAVI experience show a 5-year mortality of
59.1%. Some of the predictors of 5-year mortality seem to be modifiable, such as 
residual aortic regurgitation, type of TAVI access route and concomitant mitral
regurgitation.

BACKGROUND: Predicting outcomes in those with chronic kidney disease or following
transplantation is challenging, and current models lack detailed patient-level
information. Frailty and poor functional status are risk factors for adverse
patient outcomes that may be useful additions to prognostic tools in patients
with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine 
whether frailty or functional status are associated with increased risk of
mortality or adverse clinical outcomes in patients with advanced kidney disease.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review to identify and evaluate
studies linking frailty and functional status with patient outcomes in
populations with advanced kidney disease. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, and the
Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials. Two reviewers will conduct all
screening and data extraction independently. A modified version of the Quality In
Prognosis Studies tool will be used to evaluate the quality of the studies. If
meta-analysis of outcome data is possible, a random effects model will be used.
DISCUSSION: The results of this review will inform the development, selection,
and validation of appropriate metrics needed to improve prognostication in
patients with chronic kidney disease.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Technique failure is a major limitation of peritoneal 
dialysis. Our study aimed to identify center- and patient-level predictors of
peritoneal dialysis technique failure.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All patients on incident
peritoneal dialysis in Australia from 2004 to 2014 were included in the study
using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry.
Center- and patient-level characteristics associated with technique failure were 
evaluated using Cox shared frailty models. Death-censored technique failure and
cause-specific technique failure were analyzed as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: The study included 9362 patients from 51 centers in Australia. The
technique failure rate was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.36) episodes 
per patient-year, with a sevenfold variation across centers that was mainly
associated with center-level characteristics. Technique failure was significantly
less likely in centers with larger proportions of patients treated with
peritoneal dialysis (>29%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 
0.73 to 0.94) and more likely in smaller centers (<16 new patients per year;
adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.21) and centers
with lower proportions of patients achieving target baseline serum phosphate
levels (<40%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to
1.29). Similar results were observed for death-censored technique failure, except
that center target phosphate achievement was not significantly associated.
Technique failure due to infection, social reasons, mechanical causes, or death
was variably associated with center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal
dialysis, and/or target phosphate achievement, automated peritoneal dialysis
exposure, icodextrin use, and antifungal use. The variation of hazards of
technique failure across centers was reduced by 28% after adjusting for
patient-specific factors and an additional 53% after adding center-specific
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Technique failure varies widely across centers in Australia. A
significant proportion of this variation is related to potentially modifiable
center characteristics, including peritoneal dialysis center size, proportion of 
patients on peritoneal dialysis, and proportion of patients on peritoneal
dialysis achieving target phosphate level.

Succinic acid cibenzoline (CZ) is an antiarrhythmic agent often used for the
treatment of tachyarrhythmia. However, hypoglycemia should be avoided in the
treatment of diabetes. We herein report two late-stage elderly subjects who
experienced a severe and prolonged hypoglycemic coma after the usage of CZ. These
cases suggest that, when CZ is administered to elderly subjects with renal
dysfunction and/or frailty, we should be aware of the possibility that this
medicine may induce hypoglycemia and should adjust the dose as appropriate and
monitor the concentration of CZ to avoid severe hypoglycemia.

INTRODUCTION: This article ponders upon wearable medical measurement devices in
relation to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its' associated comorbidities - and 
whether these might benefit CKD-patients. We aimed to map the intersection(s) of 
nephrology and wearable sensor technology to help technologists understand
medical aspects, and clinicians to understand technological possibilities that
are available (or soon will become so). Areas covered: A structured literature
search on main comorbidities and complications CKD patients suffer from, was used
to steer mini-reviews on wearable sensor technologies clustered around 3 themes
being: Cardiovascular-related, diabetes-related and physical fitness/frailty.
This review excludes wearable dialysis - although also strongly enabled by
miniaturization - because that highly important theme deserves separate in-depth 
reviewing. Expert commentary: Continuous progress in integrated electronics
miniaturization enormously lowered price, size, weight and energy consumption of 
electronic sensors, processing power, memory and wireless connectivity. These
combined factors boost opportunities for wearable medical sensors. Such devices
can be regarded as enablers for: Remote monitoring, influencing human behaviour
(exercise, dietary), enhanced home care, remote consults, patient education and
peer networks. However, to make wearable medical devices succeed, the challenge
to fit them into health care structures will be dominant over the challenge to
realize the bare technologies themselves.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and
associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in
frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we
examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of
Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in 
ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24
months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled
frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during
follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of
frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores
changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change,
0.2 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity
(0.6 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7
points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher
frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores
(-1.1 points per g/dl; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition,
patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become
frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction
in frailty score (95% confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the
underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included
serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of
hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and
hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at
any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic
rate was not independently associated with frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores,
with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of 
inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening
frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or 
posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.

Radical cystectomy is associated with a high postoperative mortality and
morbidity in older patients. We aimed to define the predictive value of
comorbidity scores and determine the prognostic factors of postoperative
complications. Preoperative associated morbidities were collected and graded
according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score system, the
Adult Comorbidity Evaluation (ACE) scale and the Charlson comorbidity index.
Surgical complications were graded according to Clavien classification. Early and
late complications were recorded. Data are from 49 consecutive patients aged ≥ 75
years who had an open surgery for bladder cancer. The most commonly associated
conditions were smoking, renal insufficiency, and arterial hypertension.
Incidence of early and late complications was 49% and 16%, respectively. Four and
25 death events occurred during the early and late follow-up, respectively. The
incidence of morbidity and mortality were not related to ASA, ACE or Charlson
scores. Preoperative malnutrition, renal insufficiency, higher need of
perioperative blood transfusions, and prolonged ileus were identified as risk
factors of postoperative morbidity. Late complications seemed related to low
weight.

BACKGROUND: Survival for patients commencing renal replacement therapy is around 
90% in the first year and 83% at two years after starting dialysis. The factors
that appear to predict mortality are comorbidity and frailty associated with
kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate, age and biochemical factors.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse the condition of patients starting renal replacement
therapy, based on biomarkers commonly used in clinical practice and their
association with mortality, measured 6 and 12 months after initiating replacement
therapy.
METHODS: A one-year prospective follow-up study with 189 patients.
Sociodemographic variables, aetiology of renal disease, comorbidities, prior
nephrology service monitoring, prior renal transplantation and biochemical
parameters at the time of initiating replacement therapy were analysed.
RESULTS: The overall percentage of death during the one-year follow-up was 6.87%,
with 64% of deaths occurring during the first six months. The only variable
independently associated with mortality was low albumin levels.
CONCLUSION: Although most patients in this centre are monitored by a nephrologist
prior to starting replacement therapy, many nevertheless fail to achieve the
biochemical targets recommended. One such parameter is albumin, which proved at
the start of replacement therapy to be an independent predictor of mortality.
Findings of this study show the need to intervene on certain biochemical
parameters during the pre-dialysis stage and at the start of dialysis, in order
to improve survival in this group of patients.

BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the
general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear
whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney failure.
METHODS: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults with
end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South
America designed to examine the association between periodontitis and all-cause
and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis.
Participants were matched 1:1 on their propensity score for moderate to severe
periodontitis assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal 
Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared
frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries.
RESULTS: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe
periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score methods to generate a
matched cohort of participants with periodontitis similar to those with none or
mild periodontal disease, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a 
lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74,
95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 
person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were
not changed substantially when participants were limited to those with 12 or more
natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes of cardiovascular death.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does not appear 
to be associated with an increased risk of early death in adults treated with
hemodialysis.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered a model of accelerated aging. More
specifically, CKD leads to reduced physical functioning and increased frailty,
increased vascular dysfunction, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness,
high levels of systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased 
cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence suggests that the cognitive impairment 
associated with CKD may be related to cerebral small vessel disease and overall
impairment in white matter integrity. The triad of poor physical function,
vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment places patients living with CKD at
an increased risk for loss of independence, poor health-related quality of life, 
morbidity, and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the available 
evidence of cerebrovascular-renal axis and its interconnection with early and
accelerated cognitive impairment in patients with CKD and the plausible role of
exercise as a therapeutic modality. Understanding the cerebrovascular-renal axis 
pathophysiological link and its interconnection with physical function is
important for clinicians in order to minimize the risk of loss of independence
and improve quality of life in patients with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis and
is traditionally measured using tools that assess physical impairment. Alternate 
measurement tools highlight cognitive and functional domains, requiring
clinician, patient, and/or caregiver input. In this study, we compared frailty
measures for incident dialysis patients that incorporate patient, clinician, and 
caregiver perspectives with an aim to contrast the measured prevalence of frailty
using tools derived from different conceptual frameworks.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients was conducted
between February 2014 and June 2015. Frailty was assessed at dialysis onset
using: 1) modified definition of Fried Phenotype (Dialysis Morbidity Mortality
Study definition, DMMS); 2) Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS); 3) Frailty Assessment
Care Planning Tool (provides CFS grading, FACT-CFS); and 4) Frailty Index (FI).
Measures were compared via correlation and sensitivity/specificity analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 98 patients participated (mean age of 61 ± 14 years).
Participants were primarily Caucasian (91%), male (58%), and the majority started
on hemodialysis (83%). The median score for both the CFS and FACT-CFS was 4
(interquartile range of 3-5). The mean FI score was 0.31 (standard
deviation ± 0.16). The DMMS identified 78% of patients as frail. The FACT-CFS
demonstrated highest correlation (r = 0.71) with the FI, while the DMMS was most 
sensitive (97%, 100%) and a CFS ≥ 5 most specific (100%, 77%) at corresponding FI
cutoff values (>0.21, >0.45).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessments of incident dialysis patients that include
clinician, caregiver and patient perspectives have moderate to strong correlation
with the FI. At specified FI cutoff values, the FACT-CFS and DMMS are highly
sensitive measures of frailty. The CFS and FACT-CFS may represent viable
alternative screening tools in dialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: "Frailty" is a marker of physiological decline of multiple organ
systems, and the frailty index identifies patients who are more susceptible to
postoperative complications. The purpose of this study is to validate the
modified frailty index (MFI) as a predictor of postoperative complications,
reoperations, and readmissions in patients who underwent primary total knee
arthroplasty (TKA).
METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement
Program database from 2005 to 2014 was queried by the Current Procedural
Terminology code for primary TKA (27447). A previously described MFI was used to 
summate 11 variables in 5 organ systems. Bivariate analysis was performed for
postoperative complications. A multiple logistic regression model was used to
determine the relationship between MFI, American Society of Anesthesiologists
score, and 30-day reoperation, controlling for age, gender, and body mass index.
RESULTS: A total of 90,260 patients underwent primary TKA during the study
period. As MFI score increased, 30-day mortality significantly increased (P <
.001). In addition, significantly higher rates of postoperative complications
(all P < .001) were observed with increasing MFI: infection, wound, cardiac,
pulmonary, and renal complications; and any occurrence. More frail patients also 
had increasing odds of adverse hospital discharge disposition, reoperation, and
readmission (all P < .001). Length of hospital stay increased from 3.10 to 5.16
days (P < .001), while length of intensive care unit stay increased from 3.47 to 
5.07 days (P < .001) between MFI score 0 and ≥0.36. MFI predicts 30-day
reoperation with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.32 (95% confidence interval,
1.36-8.11; P < .001). Comparatively, MFI was a stronger predictor of reoperation 
compared with American Society of Anesthesiologists score and age with adjustment
for gender and body mass index.
CONCLUSION: Utilization of the MFI is a valid method in predicting postoperative 
complications, reoperations, and readmissions in patients undergoing primary TKA 
and can provide an effective and robust risk assessment tool to appropriately
counsel patients and aid in preoperative optimization.

Background: The burden of chronic kidney disease is highest among older adults
but the significance of a diminished level of kidney function in this
heterogeneous population is poorly understood. We sought to examine the
relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and objective
physical performance in older adults.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 4,562 participants from The Irish
Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a national cohort of community-dwelling adults aged
≥50 years. We used multivariable linear or quantile regression to model the
association between categories of cystatin C (eGFRcys) or creatinine eGFR
(eGFRcr) and the following outcomes: gait speed, timed-up-and-go (TUG) and grip
strength. Relationships were further explored using natural eGFR splines. We
examined effect modification by age in the relationship between eGFR and gait
speed.
Results: Mean (SD) age was 61.8 (8.3) years, 53.6% were female and median (IQR)
eGFRcys was 82 (70-94) mL/min/1.73m2. In multivariable-adjusted models,
participants in the lowest eGFRcys category (< 45 mL/min/1.73m2) had 3.32 cm/s
(95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.02-6.62) slower mean gait speed, 1.32 kg
(95%CI 0.20-2.44) lower mean grip strength, and 0.31 seconds (95% CI -0.04 to
0.65) longer median TUG versus the reference group (eGFRcys ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2). 
The relationship between eGFRcys and outcomes appeared linear but varied by age. 
The association between eGFRcr and outcomes tended towards a U-shape.
Conclusions: Cystatin C eGFR was linearly related to poorer physical performance 
beyond middle age among community-dwelling adults. The non-linear relationships
observed with eGFRcr underscore the limitations of creatinine as a predictor of
frailty outcomes in older individuals.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of complications in
elderly patients with a hip fracture following integrated orthogeriatric
treatment. To discover factors that might be adjusted, in order to improve
outcome in those patients, we examined the association between baseline patient
characteristics and a complicated course.
METHODS: We included patients aged 70 years and older with a hip fracture, who
were treated at the Centre for Geriatric Traumatology (CvGT) at Ziekenhuisgroep
Twente (ZGT) Almelo, the Netherlands between April 2011 and October 2013. Data
registration was carried out using the clinical pathways of the CvGT database.
Based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, patients were
divided into high-risk (HR, ASA 3 ≥, n = 341) and low-risk (LR, ASA 1-2, n = 111)
groups and compared on their recovery. Multivariate logistic regression was used 
to identify risk factors for a complicated course.
RESULTS: The analysis demonstrated that 49.6% (n = 224) of the patients
experienced a complicated course with an in-hospital mortality rate of 3.8%
(n = 17). In 57.5% (n = 196) of the HR patients, a complicated course was seen
compared to 25.2% (n = 28) of the LR patients. The most common complications in
both groups were the occurrence of delirium (HR 25.8% vs. LR 8.1%, p ≤ 0.001),
anemia (HR 19.4% vs. LR 6.3%, p = 0.001), catheter-associated urinary tract
infections (CAUTIs) (HR 10.6% vs. LR 7.2%, p = 0.301) and pneumonia (HR 10.9% vs.
LR 5.4%, p = 0.089). Independent risk factors for a complicated course were
increasing age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p = 0.023), delirium risk VMS Frailty 
score (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.04-2.37, p = 0.031) and ASA score ≥3 (OR 3.62, 95% CI
2.22-5.91, p ≤ 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: After integrated orthogeriatric treatment, a complicated course was 
seen in 49.6% of the patients with a hip fracture. The in-hospital mortality rate
was 3.8%. Important risk factors for a complicated course were increasing age,
poor medical condition and delirium risk VMS Frailty score. Awareness of risk
factors that affect the course during admission can be useful in optimizing care 
and outcomes. In the search for possible areas for improvement in care, targeted 
preventive measures to mitigate delirium, and healthcare-associated infections
(HAIs), such as CAUTIs and pneumonia are important.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review sarcopenia in chronic kidney
disease (CKD). We aim to present how definitions of sarcopenia from the general
population may pertain to those with CKD, its assessment by clinicians and
emerging therapies for sarcopenia in CKD. For this review, we limit our
description and recommendations to patients with CKD who are not on dialysis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Poorer parameters of lean mass, strength and physical function
are associated with worsening patient-centered outcomes such as limiting
mobility, falls and mortality in CKD; however, the magnitude of these
associations are different in those with and without CKD. Sarcopenia in CKD is a 
balance between skeletal muscle regeneration and catabolism, which are both
altered in the uremic environment. Multiple pathways are involved in these
derangements, which are briefly reviewed. Differences between commonly used terms
cachexia, frailty, protein-energy wasting, dynapenia and sarcopenia are
described. Therapeutic options in predialysis CKD are not well studied;
therefore, we review exercise options and emerging pharmacological therapies.
SUMMARY: Sarcopenia, now with its own International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision (ICD-10) code, is of importance clinically and should be accounted 
for in research studies in patients with CKD. Multiple therapies for sarcopenia
are in development and will hopefully be available for our patients in the
future.

An elevated systolic but not diastolic blood pressure level represents a common
finding in elderly patients and is associated with an increased risk for
developing coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery
disease, progressive cognitive decline and renal failure. Although less
frequently, elderly patients manifest not only with systolic but also diastolic
hypertension. Also in this case, the elderly patient will present an increased
risk for developing hypertension-related abnormalities. Based on several trials
conducted in patients ≥65 years and one single trial in patients ≥80 years the
most recent European guidelines recommend antihypertensive treatment in elderly
hypertensive patients with a systolic blood pressure ≥60 mmHg, with a systolic
target between 140 and 150 mmHg. In fit elderly patients <80 years treatment may 
be considered at a systolic level ≥140 mmHg with a target SBP <140 mmHg if
treatment is well tolerated. Despite of the above, at least three issues related 
to antihypertensive drug treatment in aged individuals are still debated,
particularly after the publication of a recent large scale clinical trial that
included also 2.636 patients ≥75 years and a study in nursing home residents
≥80 years, i.e. the frailest oldest patients: (1) the blood pressure threshold at
which antihypertensive drug should be initiated, (2) the blood pressure targets
of the therapeutic intervention, and (3) the approach to frail elderly
hypertensive patients. This review will critically review the evidence available 
so far on these important issues as well as the position of current guidelines
and consensus statements.

With growing numbers of elderly multiple myeloma patients, reliable tools to
assess their vulnerability are required. The objective of the analysis herein was
to develop and validate an easy to use myeloma risk score (revised Myeloma
Comorbidity Index) that allows for risk prediction of overall survival and
progression-free survival differences in a large patient cohort. We conducted a
comprehensive comorbidity, frailty and disability evaluation in 801 consecutive
myeloma patients, including comorbidity risks obtained at diagnosis. The cohort
was examined within a training and validation set. Multivariate analysis
determined renal, lung and Karnofsky Performance Status impairment, frailty and
age as significant risks for overall survival. These were combined in a weighted 
revised Myeloma Comorbidity Index, allowing for the identification of fit
(revised Myeloma Comorbidity Index ≤3 [n=247, 30.8%]), intermediate-fit (revised 
Myeloma Comorbidity Index 4-6 [n=446, 55.7%]) and frail patients (revised Myeloma
Comorbidity Index >6 [n=108, 13.5%]): these subgroups, confirmed via validation
analysis, showed median overall survival rates of 10.1, 4.4 and 1.2 years,
respectively. The revised Myeloma Comorbidity Index was compared to other
commonly used comorbidity indices (Charlson Comorbidity Index, Hematopoietic Cell
Transplantation-Specific Comorbidity Index, Kaplan-Feinstein Index): if each were
divided in risk groups based on 25% and 75% quartiles, highest hazard ratios,
best prediction and Brier scores were achieved with the revised Myeloma
Comorbidity Index. The advantages of the revised Myeloma Comorbidity Index
include its accurate assessment of patients' physical conditions and simple
clinical applicability. We propose the revised Myeloma Comorbidity Index to be
tested with the "reference" International Myeloma Working Group frailty score in 
multicenter analyses and future clinical trials. The study was registered at the 
German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS-00003868).

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the significant clinical
predictors of incident heart failure (HF) and its prognostic effect on long-term 
outcomes among community-based patients with established atrial
fibrillation (AF).
BACKGROUND: AF is associated with an increased risk of HF. However, in this
population, little focus is placed on risk stratification for and the prevention 
of HF.
METHODS: Patients with AF but without HF at baseline enrolled in the ORBIT-AF
(Outcomes Registry for Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation) registry were
included. Separate multivariable-adjusted Cox frailty regression models were used
to identify significant predictors of HF incidence and determine the associated
risk of adverse clinical events.
RESULTS: The study included 6,545 participants with AF from 173 participating
sites. Incident HF developed in 236 participants (3.6%) over the 2-year follow-up
period; ejection fraction was preserved (>40%) in 64%, reduced (≤40%) in 13.5%,
and missing in 22.5%. In multivariable analysis, traditional HF risk factors
(age, coronary artery disease, renal dysfunction, and valvular disease), presence
of permanent AF (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.60 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18 to
2.16]; reference group: paroxysmal AF), and elevated baseline heart rate (HR:
1.07 [95% CI: 1.02 to 1.13] per 5 beats/min higher heart rate) were independently
associated with incident HF risk. Incident HF among patients with AF was
independently associated with higher risk of mortality, all-cause
hospitalization, and bleeding events.
CONCLUSIONS: Incident HF among patients with AF is common, is more likely to be
HF with preserved ejection fraction, and is associated with poor long-term
outcomes. Traditional HF risk factors, AF type, and baseline heart rate are
independent clinical predictors of incident HF.

Joint Model for Mortality and Hospitalization.

Chen Y, Guo W, Kotanko P, Usvyat L, Wang Y.

Modeling hospitalization is complicated because the follow-up time can be
censored due to death. In this paper, we propose a shared frailty joint model for
survival time and hospitalization. A random effect semi-parametric proportional
hazard model is assumed for the survival time and conditional on the follow-up
time, hospital admissions or total length of stay is modeled by a generalized
linear model with a nonparametric offset function of the follow-up time. We
assume that the hospitalization and the survival time are correlated through a
latent subject-specific random frailty. The proposed model can be implemented
using existing software such as SAS Proc NLMIXED. We demonstrate the feasibility 
through simulations. We apply our methods to study hospital admissions and total 
length of stay in a cohort of patients on hemodialysis. We identify age, albumin,
neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and vintage as significant risk factors for 
mortality, and age, gender, race, albumin, NLR, pre-dialysis systolic blood
pressure (preSBP), interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) and equilibrated Kt/V (eKt/V)
as significant risk factors for both hospital admissions and total length of
stay. In addition, hospitalization admissions is positively associated with
vintage.

The scope of this article is to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors
associated with the frailty of elderly people with chronic kidney disease on
hemodialysis. This involved a correlational, cross-sectional study conducted in a
dialysis center in the state of São Paulo. The sample consisted of 60
participants. The Participant Characterization Instrument was used for extracting
sociodemographic and clinical data and the Edmonton Frail Scale was used to
evaluate the level of frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
identify the factors associated with frailty. The mean age of the 60 patients
included was 71.1 (± 6.9) years, predominantly male (70%), of which 36.7% were
classified as frail. With respect to the factors associated with frailty among
the variables of gender, age, self-reported skin color, schooling, monthly per
capita income, hemodialysis time, number of associated diseases, falls in the
year, hematocrit level, parathyroid hormone and use of calcitriol, it was found
that only the monthly per capita income was significantly associated with frailty
(OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.1-0.9; p = 0.04). There was an association between frailty
and income, showing that the elderly most at risk of frailty were those with
lower income.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older
adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive
impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of
life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in
increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in
hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients 
with pre-dialysis CKD.
METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385
patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated 
tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive
frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial.
Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of ≤24. We determined the
prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages 
G4-G5, not on dialysis.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5
had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control
group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most
pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function 
(p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of
stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment
in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects
of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of
cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes
deserves further study.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

Background: The contribution of cardiovascular dysfunction to frailty in older
adults is uncertain. This study aimed to define the relationship between frailty 
and cardiovascular structure and function, and determine whether these
associations are independent of coexisting abnormalities in other organ systems.
Methods: We studied 3,991 older adults (mean age 75.6±5.0 years; 59% female) from
the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study in whom the following six
organ systems were uniformly assessed: cardiac (by echocardiography), vascular
(by ankle-brachial-index and pulse-wave-velocity), pulmonary (by spirometry),
renal (by estimated glomerular filtration rate), hematologic (by hemoglobin), and
adipose (by body mass index and bioimpedance). Frailty was defined by the
presence of ≥3 of the following: low strength, low energy, slowed motor
performance, low physical activity, or unintentional weight loss.
Results: Two hundred eleven (5.3%) participants were frail. In multivariable
analyses adjusted for demographics, diabetes, hypertension, and measures of other
organ system function, frailty was independently and additively associated with
left ventricular hypertrophy (odds ratio [OR] = 1.72; 95% confidence interval
[CI] = 1.30-2.40), reduced global longitudinal strain (reflecting systolic
function; OR = 1.68; 95% CI = 1.16-2.44), and greater left atrial volume index
(reflecting diastolic function; OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.13-2.27), which together
demonstrated the greatest association with frailty (OR = 2.10; 95% CI =
1.57-2.82) of the systems studied. Lower magnitude associations were observed for
vascular and pulmonary abnormalities, anemia, and impaired renal function.
Cardiovascular abnormalities remained associated with frailty after excluding
participants with prevalent cardiovascular disease.
Conclusions: Abnormalities of cardiac structure and function are independently
associated with frailty, and together show the greatest association with frailty 
among the organ systems studied.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney
function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in
community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level,
and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0
(normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Frailty status
was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle
weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of
having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were more frail
(odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition,
individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or
hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of
frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. 
Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty 
in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI
1.13-14.1) CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a
higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Geriatr

Dysregulation of skeletal remodeling is a component of renal osteodystrophy.
Previously, we showed that activin receptor signaling is differentially affected 
in various tissues in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether a ligand
trap for the activin receptor type 2A (RAP-011) is an effective treatment of the 
osteodystrophy of the CKD-mineral bone disorder. With a 70% reduction in the
glomerular filtration rate, CKD was induced at 14 weeks of age in the ldlr-/-
high fat-fed mouse model of atherosclerotic vascular calcification and diabetes. 
Twenty mice with CKD, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated
activin A were treated with RAP-011, wherease 19 mice were given vehicle twice
weekly from week 22 until the mice were killed at 28 weeks of age. The animals
were then evaluated by skeletal histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography,
mechanical strength testing, and ex vivo bone cell culture. Results in the CKD
groups were compared with those of the 16 sham-operated ldlr-/- high fat-fed
mice. Sham-operated mice had low-turnover osteodystrophy and skeletal frailty.
CKD stimulated bone remodeling with significant increases in osteoclast and
osteoblast numbers and bone resorption. Compared with mice with CKD
and sham-operated mice, RAP-011 treatment eliminated the CKD-induced increase in 
these histomorphometric parameters and increased trabecular bone fraction.
RAP-011 significantly increased cortical bone area and thickness. Activin
A-enhanced osteoclastogenesis was mediated through p-Smad2 association with c-fos
and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Thus, an
ActRIIA ligand trap reversed CKD-stimulated bone remodeling, likely through
inhibition of activin-A induced osteoclastogenesis.

The incidence of infective endocarditis (IE) rises in industrialized countries.
Older people are more affected by this severe disease, notably because of the
increasing number of invasive procedures and intracardiac devices implanted in
these patients. Peculiar clinical and echocardiographic features, microorganisms 
involved, and prognosis of IE in elderly have been underlined in several studies.
Additionally, elderly population appears quite heterogeneous, from healthy people
without past medical history to patients with multiple diseases or who are even
bedridden. However, the management of IE in this population has been poorly
explored, and international guidelines do not recommend adapting the therapeutic 
strategy to the patient's functional status and comorbidities. Yet, if IE should 
be treated according to current recommendations in the healthiest patients,
concerns may rise for older patients who suffer from several chronic diseases,
especially renal failure, and are on polypharmacy. Treating frailest patients
with high-dose intravenous antibiotics during a prolonged hospital stay as
recommended for younger patients could also expose them to functional decline and
toxic effect. Likewise, the place of surgery according to the aging
characteristics of each patient is unclear. The aim of this article is to review 
the recent data on epidemiology of IE and its peculiarities in the elderly. Then,
its management and various therapeutic approaches that can be considered
according to and beyond guidelines depending on patient comorbidities and frailty
are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: Failure-to-rescue (FTR) (defined as death from a major
complication) is considered as an index of hospital quality in trauma patients.
However, the role of frailty in FTR events remains unclear. We hypothesized that 
FTR rate is higher in elderly frail trauma patients.
METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of all elderly (age ≥ 65 years) 
trauma patients presenting at our level one trauma center. Patient's frailty
status was calculated utilizing the Trauma Specific Frailty Index (TSFI) within
24 hours of admission. Patients were stratified into non-frail, pre-frail, and
frail. FTR was defined as death from a major complication (respiratory,
infectious, cardiac, and renal). Binary logistic regression analysis was
performed after adjusting for age, gender, injury severity (ISS), and vital
parameters to assess the relationship between frailty status and FTR.
RESULTS: A total of 368 elderly trauma patients were evaluated of which 25% (n = 
93) were non-frail, 38% (n = 139) pre-frail, and 37% (n = 136) frail. Overall,
30% of the patients developed in-hospital complications; of them, mortality
occurred in 26% of the patients (FTR group). In the FTR group, 69% of the
patients were frail compared to 17% pre-frail and 14% non-frail (p = 0.002). On
multivariate regression analysis for predictors of FTR, frail status was an
independent predictor of FTR (OR [95% CI] = 2.67 [1.37-5.20]; p = 0.004). On
sensitivity analysis, positive predictive value of TSFI for FTR was 69% and
negative predictive value for FTR was 67%.
CONCLUSION: In elderly trauma patients, the presence of frailty increased the
odds of FTR almost threefold as compared to non-frail. Although FTR has been
considered as an indicator of health care quality, the findings of this study
suggest that frailty status independently contributes to FTR. This needs to be
considered in the future development of quality metrics, particularly in the case
of geriatric trauma patients.

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its
impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
is less defined.
METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 
trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three
groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR
≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were
analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors
of 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the
PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767
(30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 
(12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted
Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with
severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher
prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of
death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate
and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% 
in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild
RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus
none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other
significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass
index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction,
oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male
sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year
mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is
required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a perioperative metastatic spinal
tumor frailty index (MSTFI) that could predict morbidity, mortality, and length
of stay.
METHODS: A large inpatient hospitalization database was searched from 2002 to
2011 to identify 4583 patients with spinal metastasis from breast (21.1%), lung
(34.1%), thyroid (3.8%), renal (19.9%), and prostate (21.1%) cancer who underwent
surgery. A multiple logistic regression model identified 9 independent parameters
that were used to construct the MSTFI: anemia, chronic lung disease,
coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary circulation disorders, renal
failure, malnutrition, emergent/urgent admission, and anterior/combined surgical 
approach. Patients with 0 points were categorized as "not frail," 1 as "mildly
frail," 2 as "moderately frail," and ≥3 as "severely frail."
RESULTS: The overall perioperative complication rate was 19.3% and in-patient
mortality was 3.0%. Compared with patients with no frailty, patients with
moderate frailty (odds ratio [OR] 5.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]
2.44-10.86), and severe frailty (OR 5.74; 95% CI 2.69-12.24) had significantly
increased odds of inpatient mortality (all P < 0.001). Similarly, patients with
mild frailty (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.33-2.66), moderate frailty (OR 3.83; 95% CI
2.71-5.41), and severe frailty (OR 6.97; 95% CI 4.98-9.74) had significantly
increased odds of developing a major in-hospital complication (all P < 0.001).
Length of stay also increased significantly by MSTFI (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In surgically treated patients with spinal metastasis, certain
perioperative parameters may significantly predict the risk of major in-hospital 
complications and mortality.

Dialysis care is often associated with poor outcomes including low quality of
life (QOL). To improve patient-reported outcomes, incorporation of the patient's 
needs and perspective into the medical care they receive is essential. This
article provides a framework to help clinicians integrate symptom assessment and 
other measures such as QOL and frailty scores into a clinical approach to the
contemporary supportive care of patients with advanced CKD. This approach
involves (1) defining our understanding of kidney supportive care,
patient-centered dialysis, and palliative dialysis; (2) understanding and
recognizing common symptoms associated with advanced CKD; (3) discussing the
concepts of physical function, frailty, and QOL and their role in CKD; and (4)
identifying the structural and process barriers that may arise when
patient-centered dialysis is being introduced into clinical practice.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem that is associated
with excess morbidity, mortality, and health resource utilization. The
progression of CKD is defined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and
leads to a variety of metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypertension,
anemia, and mineral bone disorder. Lower glomerular filtration rate also bears a 
strong relationship with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, end-stage
renal disease, and death. Patterns of CKD progression include linear and
nonlinear trajectories, but kidney function can remain stable for years in some
individuals. Addressing modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD is
needed to attenuate its associated morbidity and mortality. Developing effective 
risk prediction models for CKD progression is critical to identify patients who
are more likely to benefit from interventions and more intensive monitoring.
Accurate risk-prediction algorithms permit systems to best align health care
resources with risk to maximize their effects and efficiency while guiding
overall decision making.

Disturbances of water and electrolyte balance are commonly encountered in older
patients due to a multitude of physiological changes and preexisting morbidities 
with hyponatremia being the most common disorder. Even mild chronic hyponatremia 
can lead to cognitive deficits and gait instability and is associated with an
increased rate of falls and fractures. Additionally, experimental and
epidemiological data suggest that hyponatremia promotes bone resorption and
therefore increases the risk of osteoporosis. Furthermore, osteoporosis and
sarcopenia can be stimulated by hypomagnesemia. Hypernatremia often only results 
in unspecific symptoms but the condition is associated with a clearly increased
mortality. As electrolyte disturbances have a high prevalence in the geriatric
population and can contribute to geriatric syndromes and frailty, relevant
electrolyte alterations should be excluded in all geriatric patients, in
particular after a change in medication schedules.

INTRODUCTION: Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) and hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) 
are typically associated and are likely to represent a spectrum of the same
disease. The causes of both entities range from benign to life-threatening
conditions. Ischaemic causes are known to be fatal without emergency surgical
intervention.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: In this case a 93year old male experienced acute abdominal 
pain radiating to his back, with nausea and vomiting and a 2-week history of
altered bowel habit. Examination revealed abdominal tenderness and distension. He
had deranged white cell count (WCC) and renal function. Computed tomography (CT) 
revealed PI with associated HPVG. The cause was due to ischaemic pathology. The
patient was managed conservatively with antibiotics and was discharged 7days
later with resolution of his abdominal pain and WCC.
DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of HPVG secondary to PI is poorly understood but
usually indicates intestinal ischaemia, thought to carry a mortality of around
75%. HPVG in the older patient usually necessitates emergency surgery however
this is not always in the patient's best interest.
CONCLUSION: There are few reported cases of patient survival following
conservative management of PI and HPVG secondary to ischaemic pathology. This
case demonstrates the possibility of managing this condition without aggressive
surgical intervention especially when surgery would likely result in mortality
due to frailty and morbidity. Further work is required to identify suitable
patients.

Frailty with sarcopenia in cirrhosis causes liver transplant wait-list attrition 
and deaths. Regular physical activity is needed to protect patients with
cirrhosis from frailty. We subjectively assess physical performance in selecting 
patients for transplant listing, but we do not know whether clinical assessments 
reflect the extent of activity patients actually perform. To investigate this
question, 53 wait-listed patients self-assessed their performance of ordinary
physical tasks using the Rosow-Breslau survey, and clinicians assessed their
physical performance status with the Karnofsky index. We compared these
assessments with actual activity measured using an accelerometer/thermal sensing 
armband worn from 4 to 7 days. We found that their measured activity was among
the lowest reported in chronic disease, similar to that of patients with advanced
chronic pulmonary disease or renal failure. Their percentages of waking hours
spent in sedentary, light, and moderate-vigorous activity were 75.9% ± 18.9%,
18.9% ± 14.3%, and 4.9% ± 6.9%, respectively. Higher mean sedentary and lower
mean moderate-vigorous activity was significantly associated with 9 wait-list
deaths (P = 0.004). Compared with a range of 7000-13,000 steps/day in healthy
adults, patients' mean steps/day were 3164 ± 2842. Both their activity percentage
and step data were typical of other severely inactive populations. Neither their 
Rosow-Breslau scores (mean 2.3 ± 0.8, maximum 3.0) nor their Karnofsky scores
(mean 79 ± 12, maximum 100) suggested major impairment or showed a correlation
with patients' actual physical performance. In conclusion, physical activity in
patients with cirrhosis wait-listed for transplantation is highly sedentary.
Self-assessments and provider assessments of physical activity do not reliably
indicate actual performance. Whether the gap between assessed and actual
performance may be favorably modified by interventions to improve activity and
ameliorate frailty merits further study. Liver Transplantation 22 1324-1332 2016

The recent epidemiologic data pointed out, that the general number of patients on
hemodialysis is steadily increasing, especially in group of elderly patients over
75 years old. The geriatric syndromes are a multietiological disorder related to 
physiological aging and partly associated with comorbid conditions. Frailty,
falls, functional decline and disability, cognitive impairment and depression are
main geriatric syndromes and occurs in patients with impaired renal function more
often than among general population. The causes of higher prevalence of those
syndromes are not well known, but uremic environment and overall renal
replacement therapy may have an important impact on its progress. The patient
with geriatric syndrome require comprehensive treatment as well as physical
rehabilitation, psychiatric cure and support in everyday activities. Herein below
we would like to review recent literature regarding to particular features of
main geriatric syndromes in a group of nephrological patients.

BACKGROUND: Patient-centered quality outcomes such as disposition after surgery
are increasingly being scrutinized. Preoperative factors predictive of nonhome
discharge (DC) may identify at-risk patients for targeted interventions. This
study examines the association among preoperative risk factors, frailty, and
nonhome DC after elective vascular surgery procedures in patients living at home.
METHODS: The 2011-2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was
queried to identify all home-dwelling patients who underwent elective vascular
procedures (endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair, suprainguinal and
infrainguinal bypasses, peripheral endovascular interventions, carotid
endarterectomy, and stent). Preoperative frailty was measured using the modified 
frailty index (mFI; derived from Canadian Study of Health and Aging). Univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the
association of frailty and nonhome DC.
RESULTS: Of 15,843 home-dwelling patients, 1,177 patients (7.4%) did not return
home postoperatively. Frailty (mFI > 0.25) conferred a significantly increased
2-fold risk of nonhome DC disposition for each procedure type. Frailty, female
gender, open procedures, increasing age, end-stage renal disease, and occurrence 
of any postoperative complication were associated with increased risk of nonhome 
DC. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, frailty increased the odds of
nonhome DC by 60% (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4-1.8) after
adjusting for other covariates. In the presence of complications, the risk of
nonhome DC was 27.5% in frail versus 16.5% in nonfrail patients (P < 0.001). In
the absence of complications, although absolute risk was lower, frail patients
were nearly twice as likely to not return home (frail 5.5% vs. nonfrail 2.75%,
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail home-dwelling patients undergoing elective vascular procedures
are at high risk of not returning home after surgery. Preoperative frailty
assessment appears to hold potential for counseling regarding postsurgery
disposition and DC planning.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

PURPOSE: Our objective was to determine the impact of preoperative frailty, as
measured by validated Risk Analysis Index (RAI), on the occurrence of
postoperative complications after urologic surgeries in a national database
comprised of diverse practice groups and cases.
STUDY DESIGN: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database 
was queried from 2005 to 2011 for a list of abdominal, vaginal, transurethral and
scrotal urological surgeries using Current Procedural Terminology codes. The
study population was subdivided into two groups based on the nature of procedures
performed: complex procedures (inpatient) and simple procedures (outpatient).
Risk Analysis Index score was calculated using preoperative NSQIP variables to
determine preoperative frailty. Major postoperative morbidities (pulmonary,
cardiovascular, renal and infectious), mortality, return to operating room,
discharge destination and readmission to the hospital were examined.
RESULTS: The study identified 42,715 patients who underwent urological
procedures, 25,693 complex and 17,022 simple procedures. Mean RAI score (range)
was 7.75 (0-53). The majority of patients scored low on the RAI (90.57 % with
RAI < 10). As the RAI score increased, there was a significant increase in
postoperative complication and mortality rate (both p < 0.0001). Similarly, the
rate of return to operating room and hospital readmission rate increased as RAI
increased (both p < 0.0001). Additionally, rate of discharge to home decreased.
Interestingly, mortality rate in patients with high RAI did not differ comparing 
simple to complex procedures (p = 0.90), whereas complications were significantly
greater in the complex operation (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Increase in frailty, as measured by RAI score, is associated with
increased postoperative complications and mortality. RAI may allow for rapid
identification and counseling of patients who are at high risk of adverse
perioperative outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) can detect geriatric
problems and potentially improve survival, physical, and cognitive state of
patients, as well as increase an older person's chances of staying at home
longer. In older people, the number and severity of comorbidity increase with age
and are an important determinant of survival. The aim of the study was to assess 
to which extent CGA and comorbidities could be seen as determinants of survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study analyzed data from two hospitals that included 
geriatric assessments of patients aged 70 years and more with cancer linked to
mortality. Logistic regression was used to model survival predictors.
RESULTS: Two hundred and five various cancer patients (47% females) with a median
age of 79 were included. They presented with a lot of undiagnosed geriatric
problems. Screening scales (G8, SEGA), cognitive, and psychological disorders,
and low albumin levels appeared to be independent survival factors. A frailty
profile classification was associated with higher mortality. The average
comorbidity was graded 2 according to the Charlson scale. By the geriatric
cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS-G), the arithmetic average number of
affected organ systems was 5 (range 0-10) in all patients. Cardiovascular
disorders were the most common comorbidity. Renal insufficiency and anaemia were 
negatively associated with survival.
CONCLUSION: Old cancer patients present a lot of comorbidities and newly
diagnosed geriatric problems. Several tools provide determinants of survival in
old cancer patients. Prospective trials evaluating the utility of a CGA to guide 
interventions to improve quality of cancer care in older adults are justified.

Skeletal muscle mass and muscle function are negatively affected by a variety of 
conditions inherent to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to dialysis treatment.
Skeletal muscle mass and function serve as indicators of the nutritional and
clinical state of CKD patients, and low values or derangements over time are
strong predictors of poor patient outcomes. However, muscle size and function can
be affected by different factors, may decline at different rates, and may have
different patient implications. Therefore, operational definitions of frailty and
sarcopenia have emerged to encompass these 2 dimensions of muscle health, i.e.,
size and functionality. The aim of this review is to appraise available methods
for assessment of muscle mass and functionality, with an emphasis on their
accuracy in the setting of CKD patients. We then discuss the selection of
reference cutoffs for defining conditions of muscle wasting and dysfunction.
Finally, we review definitions applied in studies addressing sarcopenia and
frailty in CKD patients and discuss their applicability for diagnosis and
monitoring.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with
postoperative delirium in patients undergoing urological surgery.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated pre- and postoperative risk factors for
postoperative delirium in consecutive 215 patients who received urological
surgery between August 2013 and November 2014. Preoperative factors included
patient demographics, comorbidities, and frailty assessment. Frailty was measured
by handgrip strength, fatigue scale of depression, fall risk assessment, and gait
speed (the timed Get-up and Go test). Postoperative factors included types of
anesthesia, surgical procedure, renal function and serum albumin decline, blood
loss, surgery time, highest body temperature, and complications. Uni- and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess pre- and
postoperative predictors for the development of postoperative delirium.
RESULTS: Median age of this cohort was 67 years. Ten patients (4.7%) experienced 
postoperative delirium. These patients were significantly older, had weak
handgrip strength, a higher fall risk assessment score, slow gait speed, and
greater renal function decline compared with patients without delirium.
Multivariate analysis revealed slow gait speed (>13.0 s) and rapid renal function
decline (>30%) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow gait speed and rapid renal function decline after urological
surgery are significant factors for postoperative delirium. These data will be
helpful for perioperative patient management. This study was registered as a
clinical trial: UMIN: R000018809.

BACKGROUND: Although influence of technical complications in association to
hospital length of stay has been studied extensively in esophageal resection,
nontechnical factors responsible for prolonged length of stay have not been
reported. Using the NSQIP dataset, we hypothesized that we would be able to
identify factors associated with prolonged length of stay after esophagectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data from 2005 to
2012 were reviewed for CPT codes for esophagectomy. Outlier status for length of 
stay was defined as >75th percentile. Logistic regression was used to predict
outlier status and linear regression to discern factors contributing to longer
lengths of stay.
RESULTS: A total of 3,538 cases were reviewed. The 75th percentile for length of 
stay was 17 days. Preoperative predictors of hospital stay outliers include
emergency surgery and frailty index (odds ratios = 3.7 and 3.6; p < 0.001). Deep 
organ space infection and progressive renal insufficiency had the highest
likelihood of prolonged length of stay (odds ratios = 5.2 and 5.1; p < 0.001).
Failure to wean off of ventilator in 48 hours, urinary tract infection, and
pneumonia were associated with length of stay outlier (odds ratios = 3.7, 2.7,
and 2.7; all p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary tract infection and pneumonia after esophagectomy are
associated with longer hospital stays. Although meticulous surgical technique
remains paramount, our study demonstrates that postoperative nontechnical
complications factor into prolonged hospital stays. Focus on such factors can
lead to reductions in hospital stays.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With aging of the general population, patients who
enter dialysis therapy will more frequently have geriatric impairments and a
considerable comorbidity burden. The most vulnerable among these patients might
benefit from conservative therapy. Whether assessment of geriatric impairments
would contribute to the decision-making process of dialysis initiation is
unknown.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A systematic Medline and Embase
search was performed on December 1, 2015 to identify studies assessing the
association between risk of mortality or hospitalization and one or more
geriatric impairments at the start of dialysis therapy, including impairment of
cognitive function, mood, performance status or (instrumental) activities of
daily living, mobility (including falls), social environment, or nutritional
status.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were identified that assessed one or more geriatric
impairments with respect to prognosis. The quality of most studies was moderate. 
Only seven studies carried out an analysis of elderly patients (≥70 years old).
Malnutrition and frailty were systematically assessed, and their relation with
mortality was clear. In addition, cognitive impairment and functional outcomes at
the initiation of dialysis were related to an increased mortality in most
studies. However, not all studies applied systematic assessment tools, thereby
potentially missing relevant impairment. None of the studies applied a geriatric 
assessment across multiple domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric impairment across multiple domains at dialysis initiation 
is related to poor outcome. However, information in the elderly is sparse, and a 
systematic approach of multiple domains with respect to poor outcome has not been
performed. Because a geriatric assessment has proved useful in predicting outcome
in other medical fields, its potential role in the ESRD population should be the 
subject of future research.

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with
destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial
cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However,
surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis
rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on
hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal
kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree
decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior
instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to
adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical 
motion.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of sarcopenia as a frailty assessment tool for
patients with aortic stenosis undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR)
or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: The study cohort comprised 295 patients who underwent either SAVR (n =
156) or TAVR (n = 139). The mean preoperative Society of Thoracic Surgeons
mortality risk score was 4.7%. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were
used to calculate gender-standardized total psoas area (TPA), as a validated
measure of sarcopenia.
RESULTS: For the entire cohort, independent predictors of a composite measure of 
30-day death, stroke, renal failure, prolonged ventilation, and deep wound
infection included preoperative STS major morbidity and mortality risk score
(odds ratio [OR], 91.1; P = .02) and TPA (OR, 0.5; P = .024). Two-year survival
was 85.7% in patients with sarcopenia, compared with 93.8% in patients without
sarcopenia (P = .02). Independent predictors of late survival included TPA
(hazard ratio, 0.47; P = .02). Male sex (OR, 0.52; P = .04) and TPA (OR, 0.6; P =
.001) were predictive of high resource utilization. A separate analysis by
treatment group found that TPA predicted high resource utilization after SAVR
(OR, 0.4; P < .001), but not after TAVR (P = .66).
CONCLUSIONS: CT scan-derived measurement of TPA as an objective frailty
assessment tool predicts early morbidity and mortality, high resource
utilization, and late survival after treatment for aortic stenosis. The
correlation observed between sarcopenia and resource utilization after SAVR
versus TAVR suggests that this simple and reproducible risk assessment tool also 
may help identify those patients who will derive optimal benefit from
catheter-based therapy.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis for frailty and longitudinal cohort analysis for
mortality.
SETTING: Cardiovascular Health Study.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals (N = 2,977; mean age 77.9 ± 4.7, 40%
male, 83% white).
MEASUREMENTS: The predictor was serum FGF-23 concentration (C-terminal
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the outcomes were frailty status
(determined according to frailty phenotype criteria of weight loss, weakness,
exhaustion, slowness, and low physical activity) and mortality. Multinomial
logistic regression was used to assess the cross-sectional association between
FGF-23 and frailty and prefrailty, adjusting for demographic characteristics,
cardiovascular disease and risk factors, and kidney markers. Proportional hazards
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between
FGF-23, frailty, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 64 ± 17 mL/min per 
1.73 m(2) . Median FGF-23 was 70.3 RU/mL (interquartile range 53.4-99.2); 52%
were prefrail, and 13% were frail. After multivariate adjustment, each doubling
in FGF-23 concentration was associated with 38% (95% confidence interval (CI) =
17-62%) higher odds of frailty than of nonfrailty and 16% (95% CI = 3-30%) higher
odds of prefrailty. FGF-23 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.10-1.23) and
frailty (HR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.57-2.12) were independently associated with
mortality, but neither association was meaningfully attenuated when adjusted for 
the other.
CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of older adults, higher FGF-23 was independently
associated with prevalent frailty and prefrailty. FGF-23 and frailty were
independent and additive risk factors for mortality. FGF-23 may be a marker for
functional outcomes.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

[Hyponatremia in the elderly: its role in frailty].

[Article in French]

Hanotier P.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in elderly patients. The
incidence is about 7% in elderly healthy people but can exceed 40% in
hospitalized patients. Considering all its aetiologies hyponatremia is associated
with increased mortality and appears as a factor of poor prognosis. Alteration in
the regulation of water homeostasis in the elderly result from multiple
consequence of aging: change in body composition, alteration in renal function
and hormonal changes. The high frequency of nutritional problems, particularly
protein malnutrition predisposes the elderly to the development of hyponatremia. 
Although diuretics especially thiazides are implicated as a frequent cause of
hyponatremia on geriatric medicine, normovolemic hyponatremia and more
particularly the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis is the most common cause.
The aetiology of this syndrome can be determined in only approximately half of
the cases. Cancers and medications, principally psychotropic agents commonly
prescribed in geriatrics are the most frequent aetiologies. Hyponatremia could be
a factor of frailty in geriatrics. Mild to moderate hyponatremia is generally
considered asymptomatic but recent studies reported that asymptomatic
hyponatremia contributes to neurological troubles like cognitive disorders,
posture and gait impairments. Hyponatremia could be an independent risk factor of
falls and could be associated with the development of osteoporosis. This review
of the literature emphasizes the importance of screening and a systematic
management of hyponatremia in the elderly people, even in the minor forms and
those considered as asymptomatic.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acute pancreatitis (AP) in elderly may have an aggressive
course due to co-morbidity high rate and severe presentation. We retrospectively 
evaluated AP severity and its underlying factors in a group of elderly patients
compared with an adult population sample.
METHODS: Forty-two elderly patients (65-102years) and 48 controls (19-64years)
admitted at our Unit for biliary or alcoholic AP were retrospectively enrolled.
AP severity was evaluated by the Atlanta classification and Ransom score.
Laboratory investigations and demographic data were collected. Comparison between
the two groups was performed by t-test, ANOVA or Fisher's exact test. A
multinomial logistic regression was used to determine factors affecting AP
severity.
RESULTS: Elderly patients showed more severe Atlanta (1.81±0.75 vs 1.29±0.46;
p=0.007) and higher Ransom (2.52±1.57 vs 0.75±0.73; p<0.0001) scores. No death
was observed. Elderly patients consumed more drugs than controls, had higher
rates of cardiovascular, pulmonary and renal co-morbidity, showed higher
creatinine (1.09±0.41 vs 0.81±0.18; p=0.004) and lower calcium levels (8.43±0.48 
vs 8.88±0.44; p=0.002). We observed only one case of fluid necrosis in an old
patient. Non-necrotic fluid collections were more common in the elderly (40.5% vs
12.5%; p=0.003). At multivariate analysis, AP severity was influenced by white
blood cell-count (WBC: OR=1.94; p=0.048), aspartate-transaminase-levels (AST:
OR=1.97; p=0.02), serum lactate-dehydrogenase (LDH: OR=1.07; p=0.047) and Ransom 
score (OR=70.4; p=0.036) in elderly, while only Ransom score correlated in
controls (OR=66.04; p<0.001). The etiology (biliary/alcoholic) did not influence 
the severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients usually undergo a severe AP course, but without
increase of mortality. High WBC, LDH, AST and Ransom score at the onset may
predict AP severity.

Inequalities between genders in access to transplantation have been demonstrated.
We aimed to validate this gender inequality in a large pediatric population and
to investigate its causes. This cohort study included 6454 patients starting
renal replacement therapy before 18 years old, in 35 countries participating in
the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology/European Renal
Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry. We used
cumulative incidence competing risk and proportional hazards frailty models to
study the time to receive a transplant and hierarchical logistic regression to
investigate access to preemptive transplantation. Girls had a slower access to
renal transplantation because of a 23% lower probability of receiving preemptive 
transplantation. We found a longer follow-up time before renal replacement
therapy in boys compared with girls despite a similar estimated glomerular
filtration rate at first appointment. Girls tend to progress faster toward
end-stage renal disease than boys, which may contribute to a shorter time
available for pretransplantation workup. Overall, medical factors explained only 
70% of the gender difference. In Europe, girls have less access to preemptive
transplantation for reasons that are only partially related to medical factors.
Nonmedical factors such as patient motivation and parent and physician attitudes 
toward transplantation and organ donation may contribute to this inequality. Our 
study should raise awareness for the management of girls with renal diseases.

BACKGROUND: HIV may amplify immunological, physiological and functional changes
of ageing. We determined associations of frailty phenotype, a T-cell senescence
marker (p16(INK4a) expression), age and demographics with exposures of the
intracellular metabolites (IM) and endogenous nucleotides (EN) of
tenofovir/emtricitabine (TFV/FTC), efavirenz (EFV), atazanavir (ATV) and
ritonavir (RTV).
METHODS: Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples for drug, IM and EN
concentrations were collected at four time points in HIV+ adults receiving
TFV/FTC with EFV or ATV/RTV. Subjects underwent frailty phenotyping and
p16(INK4a) expression analysis. Non-compartmental analysis generated an area
under the curve (AUC) for each analyte. Spearman rank correlation and
Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to assess associations between AUC, demographics
and ageing markers, adjusting for multiple comparisons with the Holm procedure.
RESULTS: Subjects (n=79) ranged in age from 22-73 years (median 48 years); 48
were African-American, 24 were female, 54 received EFV. Three subjects (range
51-60 years) demonstrated frailty, with 17 subjects (range 26-60 years)
demonstrating pre-frailty. Negative associations were observed between p16(INK4a)
expression and each of FTC-triphosphate (r=-0.45), deoxyadenosine triphosphate
(dATP; r=-0.47) and deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP; r=-0.57) AUCs (P-values
<0.02). TFV and FTC AUCs were larger among subjects with lower renal function or 
higher chronological age (P-values ≤0.05). No associations were observed for EFV,
ATV or RTV AUCs.
CONCLUSIONS: Associations of IM/EN exposure and p16(INK4a) expression observed
here suggest that senescence may alter drug phosphorylation, metabolism or
transport. This finding warrants further mechanistic study to ensure optimal
treatment in the ageing HIV+ population. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01180075.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement
can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light
chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies
have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We
evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in
France.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered
in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 
with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored
for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as
renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and 
causes of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334
(23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72
years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was
observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation
was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis,
67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were 
malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and
cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty 
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high
BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is
poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of
death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In-center hemodialysis (HD) is often the default
dialysis modality for older patients. Few centers use assisted peritoneal
dialysis (PD), which enables treatment at home. This observational study compared
quality of life (QoL) and physical function between older patients on assisted PD
and HD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Patients on assisted PD who were
>60 years old and on dialysis for >3 months were recruited and matched to
patients on HD (needing hospital transport) by age, sex, diabetes, dialysis
vintage, ethnicity, and index of deprivation. Frailty was assessed using the
Clinical Frailty Scale. QoL assessments included Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS), Short Form-12, Palliative Outcomes Symptom Scale (renal), Illness
Intrusiveness Rating Scale, and Renal Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire
(RTSQ). Physical function was evaluated by Barthel Score and timed up and go
test.
RESULTS: In total, 251 patients (129 PD and 122 HD) were recruited. In unadjusted
analysis, patients on assisted PD had a higher prevalence of possible depression 
(HADS>8; PD=38.8%; HD=23.8%; P=0.05) and higher HADS depression score (median:
PD=6; HD=5; P=0.05) but higher RTSQ scores (median: PD=55; HD=51; P<0.01). In a
generalized linear regression model adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, dialysis
vintage, and frailty, assisted PD continued to be associated with higher RTSQ
scores (P=0.04) but not with other QoL measures.
CONCLUSIONS: There are no differences in measures of QoL and physical function
between older patients on assisted PD and comparable patients on HD, except for
treatment satisfaction, which is higher in patients on PD. Assisted PD should be 
considered as an alternative to HD for older patients, allowing them to make
their preferred choices.

Consequences of aging are gaining clinical relevance. In transplantation, aging
and immunosenescence impact treatment and outcomes. The impact of aging, however,
will critically depend on distinguishing healthy, chronological aging from
biological aging that may result into frailty. Approximately 15% of individuals
older than 65 years are frail, and it is expected that this condition will gain
more clinical relevance with an expected increase to greater than 20% over the
next 5 years. Clearly, frailty impacts various general aspects of health care and
organ transplantation in particular including patient selection, waitlist
management and treatment after transplantation. In general, frailty has been
characterized by a compromised physiological reserve and an augmented
vulnerability. In comparison to healthy aging, inflammatory markers and cytokines
are increased in frail older adults. Thus, modifications of the immune response, 
in addition to physical limitations and changes of metabolism, are likely to
impact outcomes after transplantation. Here, we provide a risk assessment of
frailty at the time of transplant evaluation and review effects on outcomes and
recovery after transplantation. Moreover, we summarize our current understanding 
of the pathophysiology of frailty and consequences on immune responses and
metabolism.

OBJECTIVES: To determine factors associated with hospitalisation after
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among older adults in England, and to
investigate how these factors have contributed to increasing hospitalisations
over time.
DESIGN: Cohort study.
SETTING: Primary and secondary care in England.
POPULATION: 39,211 individuals from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, who 
were eligible for linkage to Hospital Episode Statistics and mortality data, were
aged ≥ 65 and had at least 1 CAP episode between April 1998 and March 2011.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The association between hospitalisation within 28 days of 
CAP diagnosis (a 'post-CAP' hospitalisation) and a wide range of comorbidities,
frailty factors, medications and vaccinations. We examined the role of these
factors in post-CAP hospitalisation trends. We also looked at trends in post-CAP 
mortality and length of hospitalisation over the study period.
RESULTS: 14 comorbidities, 5 frailty factors and 4 medications/vaccinations were 
associated with hospitalisation (of 18, 12 and 7 considered, respectively).
Factors such as chronic lung disease, severe renal disease and diabetes were
associated with increased likelihood of hospitalisation, whereas factors such as 
recent influenza vaccination and a recent antibiotic prescription decreased the
odds of hospitalisation. Despite adjusting for these and other factors, the
average predicted probability of hospitalisation after CAP rose markedly from 57%
(1998-2000) to 86% (2009-2010). Duration of hospitalisation and 28-day mortality 
decreased over the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors we describe enable identification of patients at
increased likelihood of post-CAP hospitalisation and thus in need of proactive
case management. Our analyses also provide evidence that while comorbidities and 
frailty factors contributed to increasing post-CAP hospitalisations in recent
years, the trend appears to be largely driven by changes in service provision and
patient behaviour.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility and safety of a
balloon-expandable, re-collapsible sheath for TAVR patients, including those with
small iliofemoral access (≤5.0 mm).
BACKGROUND: The recommended iliofemoral diameter for the CoreValve TAVR system is
≥6.0 mm, but the lowest limit has not been determined.
METHODS: Of 322 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR from 1/2014 to 8/2015 at 
two institutions, 64 underwent transfemoral CoreValve implantation, using an
11/19-French balloon-expandable, re-collapsible sheath, which has a 4.45 mm outer
diameter (OD) on arterial entry, expands to 7.67 mm, then re-collapses upon
removal. Valve sizing and vascular access were determined by computed tomography,
and outcomes were assessed using the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2
(VARC-2) definitions.
RESULTS: Thirteen of 64 patients had a minimal iliofemoral artery luminal
diameter (MLD) of ≤5.0 mm (mean 4.38+/-0.59 mm, range 3.1-5.0 mm), with vessel
calcification ≤90° to 360° and tortuosity <45° to >90°. At the MLD point, the
sheath-to-artery ratios, based on the fully expanded 7.67 mm OD, ranged
1.53-2.47, higher than previously reported ratios that risk vascular
complications. Major comorbidities included chronic renal failure, severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, extreme thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis, prior cardiac
surgery, poor ventricular function, and frailty. All 64 patients had TAVR with IV
sedation and local anesthesia, with 0% sheath malfunction, 0% vascular
complications, and 0% bleeding in-hospital and at 30 days per VARC-2 definitions.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR using a balloon-expandable, re-collapsible sheath is safe,
including in small iliofemoral access ≤5.0 mm, thus considerably expanding the
population suitable for transfemoral approach. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Intermediate- or low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis were excluded from
earlier transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) clinical trials; however, 
they are already being treated by TAVI despite a lack of data regarding the
safety and efficacy in these patients. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy
of TAVI in patients at intermediate or low risk. Patients undergoing TAVI during 
2008 to 2014 were included into a shared database (n = 1,327). Procedural
outcomes were adjudicated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 2
definitions. Patients were stratified according to their Society of Thoracic
Surgeons (STS) score into 3 groups: high (STS ≥8, n = 223, 17%), intermediate
(STS 4 to 8; n = 496, 38%), or low risk (STS <4; n = 576, 45%). Low-risk patients
were significantly younger and more likely to be men compared to intermediate-
and high-risk patients. Baseline characteristics differed significantly between
the groups with a gradual increase in the rates of previous bypass surgery,
stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, lung disease, and frailty
scores, from low to high risk groups. Compared with intermediate- and high-risk
patients, low-risk patients were more likely to undergo TAVI through the
transfemoral route (81% vs 88% vs 95%, p <0.001) and under conscious sedation
(69% vs 72% vs 81%, <0.001). There were no significant differences in the rates
of procedural complications apart from acute kidney injury (19% vs 17% vs 13%, p 
= 0.03) and stroke rates (4.5% vs 2% vs 2.3%, p = 0.1). Short- and long-term
mortality rates were significantly higher for intermediate- (hazard ratio [HR]
1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 2.9) and high-risk patients (HR 4.1, 95%
CI 2.7 to 6.4) than low-risk patients also after multivariate adjustment (HR 1.6,
95% CI 1 to 2.6 and HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 4.5, respectively; all p <0.05). In
conclusion, TAVI for intermediate- and low-risk patients is safe and associated
with improved outcome compared with high-risk patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients of all ages undergoing hemodialysis (HD) have
a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and worse cognitive function than
healthy controls, and those with dementia are at high risk of death. Frailty has 
been associated with poor cognitive function in older adults without kidney
disease. We hypothesized that frailty might also be associated with poor
cognitive function in adults of all ages undergoing HD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: At HD initiation, 324 adults
enrolled (November 2008 to July 2012) in a longitudinal cohort study (Predictors 
of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in ESRD) were classified into three groups 
(frail, intermediately frail, and nonfrail) based on the Fried frailty phenotype.
Global cognitive function (3MS) and speed/attention (Trail Making Tests A and B
[TMTA and TMTB, respectively]) were assessed at cohort entry and 1-year
follow-up. Associations between frailty and cognitive function (at cohort entry
and 1-year follow-up) were evaluated in adjusted (for sex, age, race, body mass
index, education, depression and comorbidity at baseline) linear (3MS, TMTA) and 
Tobit (TMTB) regression models.
RESULTS: At cohort entry, the mean age was 54.8 years (SD 13.3), 56.5% were men, 
and 72.8% were black. The prevalence of frailty and intermediate frailty were
34.0% and 37.7%, respectively. The mean 3MS was 89.8 (SD 7.6), TMTA was 55.4 (SD 
29), and TMTB was 161 (SD 83). Frailty was independently associated with lower
cognitive function at cohort entry for all three measures (3MS: -2.4 points; 95% 
confidence interval [95% CI], -4.2 to -0.5; P=0.01; TMTA: 12.1 seconds; 95% CI,
4.7 to 19.4; P<0.001; and TMTB: 33.2 seconds; 95% CI, 9.9 to 56.4; P=0.01; all
tests for trend, P<0.001) and with worse 3MS at 1-year follow-up (-2.8 points;
95% CI, -5.4 to -0.2; P=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: In adult incident HD patients, frailty is associated with worse
cognitive function, particularly global cognitive function (3MS).

INTRODUCTION: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) are earlier frail than
people in the general population. Although this may be explained by lifelong
unfavourable social, psychological and clinical causes, underlying physiological 
pathways might be considered too. Biological measures can help identify
pathophysiological pathways. Therefore, we examined the association between
frailty and a range of serum markers on inflammation, anaemia, the metabolic
system, micronutrients and renal functioning.
METHODS: Participants (n = 757) with borderline to severe ID (50+) were recruited
from three Dutch ID care and support services.
RESULTS: Frailty was measured with a frailty index, a measure based on the
accumulation of deficits. Linear regression analyses were performed to identify
associations between frailty and biochemical measures independent of age, gender,
level of ID and the presence of Down syndrome. Frailty appears associated with
inflammation (IL-6 and CRP), anaemia, metabolic markers (glucose, cholesterol and
albumin) and renal functioning (cystatin-C and creatinine).
DISCUSSION: These results are in line with results observed in the general
population. Future research needs to investigate the causal relation between
biochemical measures and frailty, with a special focus on inflammation and
nutrition. Furthermore, the possibility to screen for frailty using biochemical
measures needs to be used.

The accumulation of deficits with increasing age results in a decline in the
functional capacity of multiple organs and systems. These changes can have a
significant influence on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of prescribed 
drugs. Although alterations in body composition and worsening renal clearance are
important considerations, for most drugs the liver has the greatest effect on
metabolism. Age-related change in hepatic function thereby causes much of the
variability in older people's responses to medication. In this review, we propose
that a decline in the ability of the liver to inactivate toxins may contribute to
a proinflammatory state in which frailty can develop. Since inflammation also
downregulates drug metabolism, medication prescribed to frail older people in
accordance with disease-specific guidelines may undergo reduced systemic
clearance, leading to adverse drug reactions, further functional decline and
increasing polypharmacy, exacerbating rather than ameliorating frailty status. We
also describe how increasing chronological age and frailty status impact liver
size, blood flow and protein binding and enzymes of drug metabolism. This is used
to contextualise our discussion of appropriate prescribing practices. For
example, while the general axiom of 'start low, go slow' should underpin the
initiation of medication (titrating to a defined therapeutic goal), it is
important to consider whether drug clearance is flow or capacity-limited. By
summarising the effect of age-related changes in hepatic function on medications 
commonly used in older people, we aim to provide a guide that will have high
clinical utility for practising geriatricians.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) in the elderly is a complex condition. It
has a direct impact on the underuse of antithrombotic therapy reported in this
population.
DISCUSSION: All patients aged ≥75 years with AF have an individual yearly risk of
stroke >4 %. However, the risk of hemorrhage is also increased. Moreover, in this
population it is common the presence of other comorbidities, cognitive disorders,
risk of falls and polymedication. This may lead to an underuse of anticoagulant
therapy. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are at least as effective as
conventional therapy, but with lesser risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The
simplification of treatment with these drugs may be an advantage in patients with
cognitive impairment. The great majority of elderly patients with AF should
receive anticoagulant therapy, unless an unequivocal contraindication. DOACs may 
be the drugs of choice in many elderly patients with AF. In this manuscript, the 
available evidence about the management of anticoagulation in elderly patients
with AF is reviewed. In addition, specific practical recommendations about
different controversial issues (i.e. patients with anemia, thrombocytopenia, risk
of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal dysfunction, cognitive impairment, risk of
falls, polymedication, frailty, etc.) are provided.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a clinically recognized syndrome of decreased
physiological reserve. The heightened state of vulnerability in these patients
confers a greater risk of adverse outcomes after even minor stressors. Our aim
was to assess the prevalence and prognostic significance of the frailty phenotype
in patients referred for heart transplantation.
METHODS: Consecutive patients referred or on the waiting list for heart
transplantation from March 2013 underwent frailty assessment. Frailty was defined
as a positive response to 3 or more of the following 5 components: weak grip
strength, slowed walking speed, poor appetite, physical inactivity, and
exhaustion. In addition, markers of disease severity were obtained, and all
patients underwent cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and depression
(Depression in Medical Illness-10) screening.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients (83 men:37 women; age, 53 ± 12 years, range,
16-73 years; left ventricular ejection fraction, 27 ± 14%) underwent frailty
assessment. Thirty-nine of 120 patients (33%) were assessed as frail. Frailty was
associated with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure, lower body
mass index, elevated intracardiac filling pressures, lower cardiac index, anemia,
hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, cognitive impairment, and depression (all ρ 
< 0.05). Frailty was independent of age, sex, heart failure duration, left
ventricular ejection fraction, or renal function. Frailty was an independent
predictor of increased all-cause mortality: 1 year actuarial survival was 79 ± 5%
in the nonfrail group compared with only 54 ± 9% for the frail group (P < 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is prevalent among patients with advanced symptomatic heart 
failure referred for heart transplantation and is associated with increased
mortality.

BACKGROUND: Frailty predicts mortality after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The
standard frailty scales, such as the Fried score, consist of a variety of
questionnaires and physical tests. Our aim was to investigate easily available
clinical data and blood markers to predict frailty at discharge, in elderly
patients after ACS.
METHODS: A total of 342 patients older than 65 years, survivors after ACS, were
included. A high number of clinical variables were collected. In addition, blood 
markers potentially linked to frailty and related to the processes of
inflammation, coagulation, hormonal dysregulation, nutrition, renal dysfunction, 
and heart dysfunction were determined. Frailty was evaluated using the Fried
score at discharge. The main outcome was frailty defined by a Fried score ≥ 3
points. Secondary endpoints were mortality and myocardial infarction at 30-month 
median follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were frail. Seven clinical variables or
biomarkers predicted frailty: age ≥ 75 years, female, prior ischemic heart
disease, admission heart failure, haemoglobin ≤ 12.5 g/dL, vitamin D ≤ 9 ng/mL,
and cystatin-C ≥ 1.2 mg/L. This model based on clinical data and biomarkers
showed an excellent discrimination accuracy for frailty (C-statistic = 0.818).
During the follow-up, 105 patients died and 137 died or suffered myocardial
infarction. The clinical data and biomarker model (C-statistics = 0.730 and
0.691) performed better than the Fried score (C-statistics = 0.676 and 0.650) for
death and death or myocardial infarction, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Easy available clinical data and biomarkers can identify frail
patients at discharge after ACS and predict outcomes better than the standard
Fried's frailty scale.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the
elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in
comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly
individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength,
body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and
endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined
outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were
assessed.
METHODS: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient
drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12
months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc
Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail
and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition
(DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years 
old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After 
some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30
to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; 
IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 
14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 
2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the 
casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that
frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney
disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either
worse endothelial function or mortality.

The prevalence of anemia in old patients is 20%. Anemia is mostly multifactorial 
associated with multiple comorbidities that are frequently observed in people of 
65 years or older. Chronic renal failure, inflammatory diseases, nutrient
deficiencies and especially iron deficiency are the most associated conditions
with anemia. Anemia represents a prognosis marker of general health in old
people. Thus anemia is associated with higher rates of morbidities (such as
unplanned hospitalizations) and greatest mortality. Therefore anemia could be
considered either as a consequence of chronic diseases or a prognosis marker of
their severity. The prognosis of chronic cardiac failure is for example worst in 
anemic patients. Finally anemia is listed as a component of the frailty.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established technique for
the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Data on long-term TAVI
outcomes, both hemodynamic and clinical, in real-world practice settings are
limited. We aim to explore the long-term clinical results in patients with severe
symptomatic aortic stenosis using multiple catheter-based options: 360
TAVI-treated patients were followed up for ≤5 years. The Medtronic CoreValve was 
used in 71% and the Edwards SAPIEN in 26%. The primary end point was all-cause
mortality during follow-up. Outcomes were assessed based on the Valve Academic
Research Consortium 2 criteria. The mean ± SD patient age was 82.1 ± 6.9 years
(56.4% women). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 7.5 ± 4.7. The clinical
efficacy end point and time-related valve safety at 3 years was 50% and 81.7%,
respectively. The calculated 3- and 5-year survival rates were 71.6% and 56.4%,
respectively. Five-year follow-up data were obtained for 54 patients alive; 96.2%
of alive patients were in the New York Heart Association class I and II, 4 years 
after TAVI. No gender differences in all-cause mortality rates were observed (p =
0.58). In multivariate analysis, hospitalization 6 months previous to TAVI
(hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 3.15, p = 0.01),
frailty (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.2, p = 0.02), acute kidney injury (HR 1.93,
95% CI 1.03 to 3.61, p = 0.04), and moderate or more paravalvular aortic
regurgitation after TAVI (HR 4.26, 95% CI 2.54 to 7.15, p <0.001) were
independent predictors for all-cause mortality. In conclusion, long-term outcomes
of TAVI are encouraging. Prevention and early identification of paravalvular leak
and acute renal failure after the procedure would improve short- and long-term
outcomes.

AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to 
complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and
functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total
number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and
assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD
0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified
Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P =
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good
construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the
potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for
patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

BACKGROUND: Older adults are at increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), its
thromboembolic complications, and bleeding. A significant percentage of
octogenarians do not receive anticoagulation therapy. The objective of this study
was to investigate the effect of thromboembolic risk, bleeding risk, and frailty 
on the anticoagulation status of octogenarians hospitalized with AF.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 682 hospitalized patients aged 
80 years and older with AF or atrial flutter in Montreal, Québec. Consumption of 
warfarin or a new oral anticoagulant was documented. Medical record data were
used to determine each patient's frailty status using the Clinical Frailty Scale 
(CFS) and to evaluate the risk of stroke (CHADS2 [Congestive Heart Failure,
Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack]) and bleeding
(HAS-BLED [Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history 
or predisposition, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly (> 65 years)
Drugs/alcohol concomitantly]). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression 
analyses were used to examine the effect of frailty status and the risk of stroke
and bleeding on the probability of receiving anticoagulation therapy.
RESULTS: Seventy percent of octogenarians with AF received anticoagulation
therapy (n = 475). A high risk of stroke (CHADS2 = 3 compared with CHADS2 = 1,
odds ratio [OR], 3.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-11.77), and the absence
of severe frailty (CFS < 7; OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.84-6.33) were independently
associated with anticoagulant use in multivariable analyses. A high risk of
bleeding (HAS-BLED score ≥ 3; OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.12-0.86) was associated with
the absence of anticoagulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a higher prevalence of appropriate
anticoagulation among octogenarians with AF than reported in previous studies.
Further work is needed to develop and disseminate tools to optimize the use of
anticoagulants in this high-risk population.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) is
increasingly performed in nonagenarians. There is scarce evidence on the
feasibility and safety of balloon-expandable TAVI in this patient population. A
total of 734 patients who underwent balloon-expandable TAVI at our institute were
included in the study. We compared 136 patients who were aged at least 90 years
at the time of TAVI (mean age 92.4 ± 2.4 years) with the remaining 598 younger
patients (mean age 79.7 ± 7.8 years). Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 end
points were compared between the 2 groups. Diabetes mellitus, coronary artery
disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and chronic lung disease were
significantly less prevalent in patients aged ≥90 years. In contrast, the
prevalence of frailty, chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation was
significantly higher in these patients. Device success was 96% in both groups.
All-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year was 2.9% and 12.5% versus 2.8% and
12.3% in patients aged ≥90 and <90, respectively (p = 0.95 for both). All major
complication rates were similar between groups. Nonagenarians had higher rates of
minor vascular complications (13.2% vs 7.7%; p = 0.04). In conclusion, performing
balloon-expandable TAVI in carefully selected group of nonagenarians is feasible 
and offers clinical benefit comparable to patients aged <90 years. Advanced age, 
in the absence of significant co-morbidities, should not deter clinicians from
evaluating patients for TAVI for severe AS.

It is known that the common physiological denominator of the ageing process is an
attenuation of functional performance with respect to the situation of young
people and adults. However, since the first cohort-based longitudinal studies, it
has not been possible to establish a "linear" relationship between age and
glomerular filtration in all cases. This does not mean that there is no
physiological ageing process at all; in addition to those already elucidated, its
mechanisms include cell senescence, podocyte dysfunction, a vitamin D deficiency,
and homozygotic forms of the MYH9 gene. The aim of the present work was to
analyse the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and, where possible, the
correlation between CKD, defined by an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), plasma
25(OH)D3 levels and the MYH9 gene in a population of elderly and very elderly
persons. These parameters have not been evaluated previously in populations of
elderly and very elderly patients. It is concluded that a moderate decrease in
the eGFR occurs with age. This does not imply the presence of CKD in elderly
people, since in most individuals the reduced eGFR is not accompanied by anaemia,
and no individuals show hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia or a high Alb/Cr ratio.
Here we observed a lower Hb level and an elevated Alb/Cr ratio in subjects
heterozygotic for the MYH9 gene. This could be interpreted in the sense that the 
gene could exert some protective effect on renal function, whereas the
heterozygotic form (allele A) of the MYH9 gene could be considered a very early
marker, a new risk factor for the appearance of CKD, or a sign of renal frailty
in elderly people.

OBJECTIVES: In elderly hemodialysis patients, protein-energy wasting is
associated with poor outcome; however, the association between body mass index
(BMI) changes over time, and survival has been seldom studied in this
particularly frail population.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study recruited 502 hemodialysis patients
aged ≥75 years from the French cohort ARNOS and followed them from 2005 to 2009. 
BMI changes over time were modeled by individual linear regression models.
Survival analyses used frailty Cox models.
RESULTS: The population average age was 80.9 years. Forty-one percent of the
patients died during follow-up. A 1 kg/m(2) lower baseline BMI was associated
with a 4% increase in the risk of death over the study period (hazard ratio [HR] 
1.04, 95% confidence interval [1.01-1.08], P = .02). A 5% BMI loss per year was
associated with a 52% increase in the risk of death (HR 1.52, 95% confidence
interval [1.32-1.75], P < .001). In patients who lost weight (>5% BMI loss per
year), the lower was the baseline BMI, the higher was the HR for death. There was
a similar trend in the patients with stable weight (5% BMI loss-5% BMI gain per
year). In patients who gained weight, the HR was unexpectedly higher than in
those with stable weight.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly hemodialysis patients, the impact of the BMI percent
change on survival was stronger than that of the baseline BMI. Patients with
stable weight had longer survivals than patients who lost or gained weight. Thus,
in this population, BMI changes should be regularly assessed. Further studies
should assess the safety of weight gain strategies.

BACKGROUND: The elderly form an expanding proportion of patients with chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide. The increased physiological
frailty and functional morbidity associated with the aging process pose unique
challenges when planning optimal management of an older patient needing renal
replacement therapy (RRT).
AIMS: This position paper discusses current evidence regarding the optimal
management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly with an emphasis on
hemodialysis since it is the most common modality used in older patients. Further
research is needed to define relevant patient-reported outcome measures for
end-stage renal disease including functional assessments and psychological
impacts of various forms of RRT. For those older patients who have opted for
dialysis treatment, it is important to study the strategies that encourage
greater uptake of home-based dialysis therapies and optimal vascular access.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of advanced chronic kidney disease in the elderly can
be challenging but also extremely rewarding. The key issue is adopting a
patient-focused and individualized approach that seeks to achieve the best
outcomes based on a comprehensive holistic assessment of what is important to the
patient.

BACKGROUND: Time in therapeutic range (TTR) of international normalized ratio
(INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 is important for the safety and effectiveness of warfarin
anticoagulation. There are few data on TTR among patients with atrial
fibrillation (AF) in community-based clinical practice.
METHODS: Using the US Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial
Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF), we examined TTR (using a modified Rosendaal method)
among 5,210 patients with AF on warfarin and treated at 155 sites. Patients were 
grouped into quartiles based on TTR data. Multivariable logistic regression
modeling with generalized estimating equations was used to determine patient and 
provider factors associated with the lowest (worst) TTR.
RESULTS: Overall, 59% of the measured INR values were between 2.0 and 3.0, with
an overall mean and median TTR of 65% ± 20% and 68% (interquartile range [IQR]
53%-79%). The median times below and above the therapeutic range were 17% (IQR
8%-29%) and 10% (IQR 3%-19%), respectively. Patients with renal dysfunction,
advanced heart failure, frailty, prior valve surgery, and higher risk for
bleeding (ATRIA score) or stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score) had significantly lower TTR
(P < .0001 for all). Patients treated at anticoagulation clinics had only
slightly higher median TTR (69%) than those not (66%) (P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AF in US clinical practices, TTR on warfarin is 
suboptimal, and those at highest predicted risks for stroke and bleeding were
least likely to be in therapeutic range.

Falls and mineral and bones disorders are both implicated in the occurrence of
pathological fractures in patients undergoing chronic dialysis. However, data on 
falls among this population are rare. We carried out a prospective study during
four weeks and included 70 patients on chronic hemodialysis with the main
objectives being to evaluate the incidence of falls and factors related to it. At
the end of the four weeks, 16 patients (22.86%) fell at least once, with a total 
of 17 falls during 4 weeks, giving an incidence of 3.2 falls per patient/year.
The mean age was 40 ± 16 years. Five patients (31.2%) had a past history of
pathological fractures. Ten patients (62.5%) presented intra- and post-dialysis
hypotension, six (37.5%) was diagnosed of gait disorders and two (12.5%) had
sensory deficit of the lower limbs. Six patients (37.5%) presented frailty.
Hypotension (P=0.004), frailty (P=0.047) and sensory deficit (P=0.049) were
significantly associated with the occurrence of falls. The incidence of falls is 
relatively high in our hemodialysis patients and real risk factors exist. Hence, 
it is important to implement programs for falls prevention to reduce their
incidence and impact.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition 
with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more
frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other
chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in
pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an
outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was
modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was
used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed 
using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.
RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were
significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those 
who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of
frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was
significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower
physical and mental quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in
pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential
role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of
life.

BACKGROUND: Hospitalised older patients are complex. Comorbidity and polypharmacy
complicate frailty. Significant numbers have dementia and/or cognitive
impairment. Pain is highly prevalent. The evidence base for pain management in
cognitively impaired individuals is sparse due to methodological issues. A wealth
of expert opinion is recognised potentially providing a useful evidence base for 
guiding clinical practice. The study aimed to gather expert opinion on pain
management in cognitively impaired hospitalised older people.
METHODS: Consultant Geriatricians listed as dementia leads in the National
Dementia Audit were contacted electronically and invited to respond. The
questionnaire sought information on their role, confidence and approach to pain
management in cognitively impaired hospitalised patients. Responses were analysed
using a mixed methods approach.
RESULTS: Respondents considered themselves very confident in the clinical field. 
Awareness of potential to do harm was highly evident. Unequivocally responses
suggested paracetamol is safe and should be first choice analgesic, newer opiates
should be used preferentially in renal impairment and nefopam is unsafe. A
grading of the safety profile of specific medications became apparent, prompting 
requirement for further evaluation and holistic assessment.
CONCLUSION: The lack of consensus reached highlights the complexity of this
clinical field. The use of paracetamol first line, newer opiates in renal
impairment and avoidance of nefopam are immediately transferrable to clinical
practice. Further review, evaluation and comparison of the risks associated with 
other specific analgesics are necessary before a comprehensive clinical guideline
can be produced.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

Body composition in chronic kidney disease.

USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

BACKGROUND: Falls among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have
significant consequences for quality of life and functional independence,
morbidity, healthcare utilization and even mortality, but studies on the etiology
of falls within large HD cohorts are limited.
METHODS: Falls during the past 12 months were ascertained for a prevalent
multi-center HD cohort (n = 762) aged 20-92 years, and associations with
demographic and treatment characteristics, comorbidities, cognitive function,
prescribed medications, balance tests, frailty and depressive symptoms were
assessed.
RESULTS: Falls were sustained by 28.4% of participants. In multivariable-adjusted
analyses, participants classified as frail were over two times more likely to
report falls [odds ratio (OR): 2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-4.71, P =
0.01], and participants with a CES-D score 18+ and/or prescribed antidepressants 
were over 80% more likely to be fallers (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.23-2.74, P = 0.003) 
than were participants with a CES-D score <18 and no prescribed antidepressants.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty and depressed mood, factors that are potentially modifiable,
are prominently associated with falls.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and
nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney
disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia
are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here.
RECENT FINDINGS: The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among
the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The
association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD 
stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely
associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger
associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy
supplementation combined with low-protein diet for the management of CKD may
prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but
dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis 
therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum
bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23 mEq/l for
nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A
benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven.
SUMMARY: Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and
integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing
comorbidities.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients 
on dialysis; however, previous studies have not taken into account the severity
of frailty as a predictor of outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess if
there was an association between the degree of frailty and mortality among
patients on incident dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A cohort study of incident chronic
dialysis patients was conducted between January of 2009 and June of 2013 (last
follow-up in December of 2013). On the basis of overall clinical impression, the 
Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score was determined for patients at the start of
dialysis by their primary nephrologist. This simple scale allocates a single
point to different states of frailty (1, very fit; 2, well; 3, managing well; 4, 
vulnerable; 5, mildly frail; 6, moderately frail; 7, severely frail or terminally
ill) with an emphasis on function of the assessed individual. The primary outcome
was time to death. Patients were censored at the time of transplantation.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 390 patients with completed CFS scores (mean age
of 63±15 years old). Most were Caucasian (89%) and men (67%), and 30% of patients
had ESRD caused by diabetic nephropathy. The median Charlson Comorbidity Index
score was 4 (interquartile range =3-6), and the median CFS score was 4
(interquartile range =2-5). There were 96 deaths over 750 patient-years at risk. 
In an adjusted Cox survival analysis, the hazard ratio associated with each
1-point increase in the CFS was 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.43;
P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher severity of frailty (as defined by the CFS) at dialysis
initiation is associated with higher mortality.

Bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3) is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) member of the bombesin receptor family. Several studies have suggested an 
association between obesity, alterations in glucose metabolism, diabetes and the 
BRS-3 receptor. In this study, we focused on patients simultaneously diagnosed
with obesity and type 2 diabetes (OB/T2D). The analysis of BRS-3 expression in
the skeletal muscle of these patients revealed a marked decrease in the
expression of BRS-3 at the mRNA (23.6 ± 1.3-fold downregulation, p<0.0001) and
protein level (49 ± 7% decrease, p<0.05) compared to the normal patients (no
obesity and diabetes). Moreover, in cultured primary myocytes from patients with 
OB/T2D, the synthetic BRS-3 agonist, [D-Try6,β-Ala11,Phe13,Nle14]bombesin6-14,
significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), p90RSK1, protein kinase B (PKB) and p70s6K. Specifically, the
ligand at 10-11 M induced the maximal phosphorylation of MAPKs (p42, 159 ± 15% of
the control; p44, 166 ± 11% of the control; p<0.0001) and p90RSK1 (148 ± 2% of
the control, p<0.0001). The basal phosphorylation levels of all kinases were
reduced (p<0.05) in the patients with OB/T2D compared to the normal patients.
Furthermore, the BRS-3 agonist stimulated glucose transport, which was already
detected at 10-12 M (133 ± 9% of the control), reached maximal levels at 10-11 M 
(160 ± 9%, p<0.0001) and was maintained at up to 10-8 M (overall mean, 153 ± 7%; 
p < 0.007). This effect was less promiment than that attained with 10-8 M insulin
(202 ± 9%, p = 0.009). The effect of the agonist on glycogen synthase a activity 
achieved the maximum effect at 10-11 M (165 ± 16% of the control; p<0.0001),
which did not differ from that observed with higher concentrations of the
agonist. These results suggest that muscle cells isolated from patients with
OB/T2D have extremely high sensitivity to the synthetic ligand, and the effects
are particularly observed on MAPK and p90RSK1 phosphorylation, as well as glucose
uptake. Moreover, our data indicate that BRS-3 may prove to be useful as a
potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with OB/T2D.

AIM: Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on its impact
on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different
self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these patients has not been
attempted before.
METHODS: A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural centre was
recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered
to these patients. Clinical and dialysis-related laboratory parameters were
collected. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis
complications were performed, and variables demonstrating significant
correlations were entered into multivariate regression models to determine their 
independent associations.
RESULTS: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail
Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and
Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic
dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire showed significant association with each
other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated
significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher Liu's
comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and creatinine
levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The other five
questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important
dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis
identified an independently negative association between serum albumin and the
simple FRAIL scale results (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study establishing the utility of different
self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients.
The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a closer relationship with
dialysis-related complications.

Optimal glycaemic control in elderly people with type 2 diabetes: what does the
evidence say?

The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is rising in an ageing
population through a combination of lifestyle changes and greater longevity.
However, by excluding participants aged over 70 years, most major interventional 
trials on which current diabetes therapeutic guidelines are based have failed to 
provide specific evidence to support the prescribed management of diabetes in
elderly people. While diabetes per se has a significant impact on the elderly
person, the side effects of medications, particularly hypoglycaemia, prevent
optimisation of diabetes treatment. Hypoglycaemia is associated with significant 
morbidity, to which elderly people are often more vulnerable because of factors
such as the effects of ageing, progressive renal impairment, frailty,
polypharmacy and cognitive decline. T2DM is associated with accelerated cognitive
decline in some individuals, and recurrent severe hypoglycaemia has been
implicated as a potential contributory factor. Although the evidence for
selection of appropriate glycaemic targets in elderly patients is sparse, it is
now acknowledged that prevention of hypoglycaemia must influence
individualisation of treatment goals in this vulnerable group. This should also
be reflected by the choice of anti-diabetes agents that are initiated when diet
and lifestyle advice is ineffective. Recently developed international guidelines,
which have specifically addressed the management of diabetes in elderly people,
highlight the importance of a pragmatic management approach rather than
attempting to achieve a generic glycated haemoglobin goal and are summarised in
this article.

BACKGROUND: Frailty in older age is known to be associated with cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk. However, the extent to which frailty is associated with the
CVD risk profile has been little studied. Our aim was to examine the associations
of a range of cardiovascular risk factors with frailty and to assess whether
these are independent of established CVD.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study of a socially representative sample of 1622
surviving men aged 71-92 examined in 2010-2012 across 24 British towns, from a
prospective study initiated in 1978-1980. Frailty was defined using the Fried
phenotype, including weight loss, grip strength, exhaustion, slowness and low
physical activity.
RESULTS: Among 1622 men, 303 (19%) were frail and 876 (54%) were pre-frail.
Compared with non-frail, those with frailty had a higher odds of obesity (OR
2.03, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.99), high waist circumference (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.67 to
3.17), low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.47 to 
3.54) and hypertension (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.54). Prevalence of these
factors was also higher in those with frailty (prevalence in frail vs non-frail
groups was 46% vs 31% for high waist circumference, 20% vs 11% for low HDL and
78% vs 65% for hypertension). Frail individuals had a worse cardiovascular risk
profile with an increased risk of high heart rate, poor lung function (forced
expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)), raised white cell count (WCC), poor renal
function (low estimated glomerular filtration rate), low alanine transaminase and
low serum sodium. Some risk factors (HDL-C, hypertension, WCC, FEV1, renal
function and albumin) were also associated with being pre-frail. These
associations remained when men with prevalent CVD were excluded.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was associated with increased risk of a range of
cardiovascular factors (including obesity, HDL-C, hypertension, heart rate, lung 
function, renal function) in older people; these associations were independent of
established CVD.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Testosterone among Patients with End-Stage Renal
Disease.

The prevalence of low testosterone level is particularly high among patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been associated with mortality. In
populations without ESRD, low testosterone level has also been associated with a 
number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low
muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty. However, there
is controversy regarding what constitutes low testosterone level in the aging
population and at what level replacement therapy with testosterone is indicated. 
There are no randomized controlled trials investigating long-term outcomes of
testosterone replacement therapy in populations with or without ESRD. Available
trial results suggest equivocal improvements in sexual function. Muscle mass and 
bone mineral density appear to improve, but results in physical function and
performance are mixed and there are no data on fracture prevention. Some recent
data suggest harm when testosterone was given to men with limited mobility.
Finally, there is little evidence that testosterone adds to existing
erythropoietin agents in the treatment of anemia in ESRD. Due to lack of evidence
supporting long-term use of testosterone, the authors recommend against the
routine use of testosterone in ESRD patients with low testosterone levels.
Testosterone treatment can be considered in those with low bone mass and total
testosterone level <200 ng/dl, or in younger patients with sexual complaints with
total testosterone level lower than the reference range. It is important to
engage patients in discussion of risks and benefits before initiating
testosterone therapy; testosterone therapy should be discontinued if the intended
treatment effect is not observed after short-term use.

Renal functional reserve and renal recovery after acute kidney injury.

Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.

Renal functional reserve (RFR) represents the capacity of the kidney to increase 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to certain physiological or
pathological stimuli or conditions. Once baseline GFR is determined, RFR can be
assessed clinically after an oral protein load or intravenous amino acid
infusion. In clinical practice, baseline GFR displays variable levels due to diet
or other factors. RFR is the difference between peak 'stress' GFR induced by the 
test (p.o. or i.v.) and the baseline GFR. In clinical scenarios where
hyperfiltration is present (high baseline GFR due to pregnancy, hypertension or
diabetic nephropathy, in solitary kidney or kidney donors), RFR may be fully or
partially used to achieve normal or supranormal renal function. Since commonly
used renal function markers, such as GFR, may remain within normal ranges until
50% of nephrons are lost or in patients with a single remnant kidney, the RFR
test may represent a sensitive and early way to assess the functional decline in 
the kidney. RFR assessment may become an important tool to evaluate the ability
of the kidney to recover completely or partially after a kidney attack. In case
of healing with a defect and progressive fibrosis, recovery may appear complete
clinically, but a reduced RFR may be a sign of a maladaptive repair or
subclinical loss of renal mass. Thus, a reduction in RFR may represent the
equivalent of renal frailty or susceptibility to insults. The main aim of this
article is to review the concept of RFR, its utility in different clinical
scenarios, and future perspective for its use.

The prevalence of aortic valve stenosis (AS) is growing in developed countries
because its prevalence increases with age. A growing number of elderly patients
are currently referred to specialized centres to be evaluated for potential
therapeutic strategies. Indeed, two techniques are nowadays able to treat
high-risk AS patients: TAVI and surgical replacement (AVR). It is the purpose of 
the present review to summarize current knowledge on safety and efficacy of AVR
and TAVI in high-risk patients; to focus on some aspects of recently published
guidelines; to emphasize the growing importance of pre-operative individual risk 
assessment, which is considered the real crucial point for patient selection and 
trial's comparisons. Indeed, it is worth of noting that currently adopted
risk-scores do not show satisfactory performances. Accordingly, it becomes of
utmost importance to investigate several baseline but still neglected patients'
characteristics (e.g. frailty, functional status, co-morbid conditions, etc.), as
well as their pathogenetic relationships with interventional results and
follow-up prognosis. All these items are emphasized in the present review.
Finally, we have tried to anticipate future scenarios in terms of both ongoing
clinical trials and improvements of risk-scores.

OBJECTIVE: Current preoperative assessments for cardiac surgery, such as the
European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II and the Society of
Thoracic Surgeons risk score, are limited in their ability to predict
postoperative outcomes. This is thought to be due to the reliance on
chronological age as a predictor of health. In geriatrics, frailty assessments
have been developed as a tool in determining physiologic functioning capacity.
Whether or not frailty predicts postoperative outcomes independent of existing
cardiac preoperative risk scores remains unknown.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review to determine the association of frailty
with negative postoperative outcomes such as major adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We
searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, and Ageline from inception until
July 2013 and screened 5913 abstracts for potential inclusion. Of these, 6
studies examined the relationship between objective frailty assessments and
postoperative outcomes. Our included studies evaluated 4756 patients undergoing
cardiac surgery.
RESULTS: Frailty, defined using multiple criteria, had a strong positive
relationship with the risk of MACCE (odds ratio, 4.89; 95% confidence interval,
1.64-14.60). Relationships were stronger in older patients undergoing
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) than younger patients undergoing
coronary artery bypass grafting and valvular surgery (hazard ratio for frailty in
TAVR, 3.31-4.89 vs hazard ratio for non-TAVR, 1.10-3.16).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients deemed frail, determined using an objective assessment
tool, have a higher likelihood of experiencing mortality, morbidity, functional
decline, and MACCE following cardiac surgery, regardless of definition. Further
study is needed to determine which components of frailty are most predictive of
negative postoperative outcomes before integration in risk prediction scores.

Hemodialysis (HD) is routinely offered to patients with end-stage renal disease
in the United States who are ineligible for other renal replacement modalities.
The frequency of HD among the US population is greater than all other countries, 
except Taiwan and Japan. In US, patients are often dialyzed irrespective of age, 
comorbidities, prognosis, or decision-making capacity. Determination of when
patients can no longer dialyze is variable and can be dialysis-center specific.
Determinants may be related to progressive comorbidities and frailty, mobility or
access issues, patient self-determination, or an inability to tolerate the
treatment safely for any number of reasons (e.g., hypotension, behavioral
issues). Behavioral issues may impact the safety of not only patients themselves,
but also those around them. In this article the authors present the case of an
elderly patient on HD with progressive cognitive impairment and combative
behavior placing him and others at risk of physical harm. The authors discuss the
medical, ethical, legal, and psychosocial challenges to care of such patients who
lack decision-making capacity with a focus on variable approaches by regions and 
culture. This manuscript provides recommendations and highlights resources to
assist nephrologists, dialysis personnel, ethics consultants, and palliative
medicine teams in managing such patients to resolve conflict.

IMPORTANCE: The Frailty Index (FI) is a known predictor of adverse outcomes in
geriatric patients. The usefulness of the FI as an outcome measure in geriatric
trauma patients is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the usefulness of the FI as an effective assessment tool in 
predicting adverse outcomes in geriatric trauma patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2-year (June 2011 to February 2013)
prospective cohort study at a level I trauma center at the University of Arizona.
We prospectively measured frailty in all geriatric trauma patients. Geriatric
patients were defined as those 65 years or older. The FI was calculated using 50 
preadmission frailty variables. Frailty in patients was defined by an FI of 0.25 
or higher.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was in-hospital
complications. The secondary outcome measure was adverse discharge disposition.
In-hospital complications were defined as cardiac, pulmonary, infectious,
hematologic, renal, and reoperation. Adverse discharge disposition was defined as
discharge to a skilled nursing facility or in-hospital mortality. Multivariate
logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between the FI and
outcomes.
RESULTS: In total, 250 patients were enrolled, with a mean (SD) age of 77.9 (8.1)
years, median Injury Severity Score of 15 (range, 9-18), median Glasgow Coma
Scale score of 15 (range, 12-15), and mean (SD) FI of 0.21 (0.10). Forty-four
percent (n = 110) of patients had frailty. Patients with frailty were more likely
to have in-hospital complications (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-6.0; P = .001)
and adverse discharge disposition (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4; P = .001).
The mortality rate was 2.0% (n = 5), and all patients who died had frailty.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The FI is an independent predictor of in-hospital
complications and adverse discharge disposition in geriatric trauma patients.
This index should be used as a clinical tool for risk stratification in this
patient group.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors can minimize the hypoglycaemic burden and
enhance safety in elderly people with diabetes.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among elderly people is
increasing. Often associated with disabilities/comorbidities, T2DM lowers the
chances of successful aging and is independently associated with frailty and an
increased risk of hypoglycaemia, which can be further exacerbated by
antihyperglycaemic treatment. From this perspective, the clinical management of
T2DM in the elderly is challenging and requires individualization of optimum
glycaemic targets depending on comorbidities, cognitive functioning and ability
to recognize and self-manage the disease. The lack of solid evidence-based
medicine supporting treatment guidelines for older people with diabetes further
complicates the matter. Several classes of medicine for the treatment of T2DM are
currently available and different drug combinations are often required to achieve
individualized glycaemic goals. Many of these drugs, however, carry disadvantages
such as the propensity to cause weight gain or hypoglycaemia. Dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, a recent addition to the pharmacological
armamentarium, have become widely accepted in clinical practice because of their 
efficacy, low risk of hypoglycaemia, neutral effect on body weight, and
apparently greater safety in patients with kidney failure. Although more
information is needed to reach definitive conclusions, growing evidence suggests 
that DPP-4 inhibitors may become a valuable component in the pharmacological
management of elderly people with T2DM. The present review aims to delineate the 
potential advantages of this pharmacological approach in the treatment of elderly
people with T2DM.

BACKGROUND: A well-accepted definition of frailty includes measurements of
physical performance, which may limit its clinical utility.
STUDY DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, we compared prevalence and patient
characteristics based on a frailty definition that uses self-reported function to
the classic performance-based definition and developed a modified
self-report-based definition.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prevalent adult patients receiving hemodialysis in 14
centers around San Francisco and Atlanta in 2009-2011.
INDEX TESTS: Self-report-based frailty definition in which a score lower than 75 
on the Physical Function scale of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)
was substituted for gait speed and grip strength in the classic definition;
modified self-report definition with optimized Physical Function score cutoff
points derived in a development (one-half) cohort and validated in the other
half.
REFERENCE TEST: Performance-based frailty defined as 3 of the following: weight
loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed.
RESULTS: 387 (53%) patients were frail based on self-reported function, of whom
209 (29% of the cohort) met the performance-based definition. Only 23 (3%) met
the performance-based definition of frailty only. The self-report definition had 
90% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 54% positive predictive value, 93% negative
predictive value, and 72.5% overall accuracy. Intracellular water per kilogram of
body weight and serum albumin, prealbumin, and creatinine levels were highest
among nonfrail individuals, intermediate among those who were frail by
self-report, and lowest among those who also were frail by performance. Age,
percentage of body fat, and C-reactive protein level followed an opposite
pattern. The modified self-report definition had better accuracy (84%; 95% CI,
79%-89%) and superior specificity (88%) and positive predictive value (67%).
LIMITATIONS: Our study did not address prediction of outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the self-report-based but not the
performance-based definition of frailty may represent an intermediate phenotype. 
A modified self-report definition can improve the accuracy of a
questionnaire-based method of defining frailty.

BACKGROUND: Although individuals with kidney disease, including those dependent
on dialysis, often present clinically with signs and symptoms consistent with
frailty, there is limited information about sociodemographic and clinical risk
factors that may be associated.
METHODS: Seven hundred forty-five patients undergoing hemodialysisbetween 2009
and 2011 in 7 Atlanta dialysis clinics and 7 San Francisco bay area dialysis
clinics were assessed using the validated Fried frailty index (recent
unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk
speed, low physical activity) that defines frailty as the presence of 3 or more
criteria. Study coordinators interviewed participants; measured grip strength,
walk speed, and body composition; and reviewed records for clinical and
laboratory parameters. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the
association of patient characteristics with frailty.
RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, peripheral vascular disease and cardiac diseases, 
including dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, pericarditis, and
cardiac arrest, were associated with higher odds for frailty, whereas black race 
and higher serum albumin concentration were associated with lower odds for
frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: In multivariable analyses, the risk for frailty in patients
undergoing hemodialysis, as assessed by the presence of 3 or more criteria that
comprise the Fried frailty index, was increased in association with peripheral
vascular disease and cardiac conditions, such as dysrhythmia and atrial
fibrillation, and was decreased for those with higher serum albumin concentration
and for blacks compared with whites. Among patients who met the Fried definition 
of frailty, 78% scored as frail on walk speed and 56% scored as frail on grip
strength, the 2 physical performance measures.

BACKGROUND: Preliminary study to assess the risk profile and outcomes of patients
aged over 90years at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention.
METHODS: A database search was performed to identify patients 90years or over at 
the time of percutaneous coronary intervention. Risk profile scores (Charlson
Comorbidity Index, SYNTAX, Logistic clinical SYNTAX, New York PTCA score and
frailty indices) were evaluated on 24 consecutive patients in order to determine 
the best predictor for survival. Between both groups (survivors and
non-survivors) unpaired Student's t-test was used to determine statistical
significance.
RESULTS: The New York PTCA score was significantly higher in those patients that 
died in hospital (n=5) when compared to those who survived to discharge (n=19)
(NY PTCA score of 20.9±5.4 vs. 4.5±0.8, p<0.001) and this was also seen with
mortality at 12months. The level of co-morbidity (Charlson index) was similar in 
patients who died in hospital (n=5) compared with those who survived to discharge
(n=19, Charlson comorbidity index of 3.4±0.7 vs.3.9±0.6, p=0.70). This trend was 
also observed at 1year. The average level of frailty (by the CSHA Clinical
Frailty Scale), SYNTAX score and logistic clinical SYNTAX were not significantly 
different between the two groups both at discharge and at 12months. Choosing an
arbitrary New York PTCA score of 9%, nearly two thirds of patients above this
level died, whereas no patient below this level of risk died in hospital.
CONCLUSION: This small observational study found that nonagenarians who underwent
PCI had relatively low comorbidity and SYNTAX scores. The specific coronary
intervention (New York PTCA) risk score appears to have more predictive power in 
this small group of patients than the other three scores. Crucially, the factors 
that determine risk by New York PTCA score - haemodynamic instability, shock,
pulmonary oedema, renal failure, etc. - are commonly encompassed by an
"end-of-bed" assessment of the patient and these patients that pass this test
ought not to be denied PCI on the basis of their advanced years.

Author information:

Center, Baltimore VA Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in 
individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on 
their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of
cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that
highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid
conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating
cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including
microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally,
studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected
in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with
worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk
of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible
short-term effects on markers of physical performance.
SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to

BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides
(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with occlusive or aneurysmal vascular disease are repeatedly 
exposed to intravascular (IV) contrast for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. We
sought to determine the long-term impact of cumulative iodinated IV contrast
exposure (CIVCE) on renal function; the latter was defined by means of National
Kidney Foundation (NKF) criteria.
METHODS: We performed a longitudinal study of consecutive patients without renal 
insufficiency at baseline (NFK stage I or II) who underwent interventions for
arterial occlusive or aneurysmal disease. We collected detailed data on any IV
iodinated contrast exposure (including diagnostic or therapeutic angiography,
cardiac catheterization, IV pyelography, computed tomography with IV contrast,
computed tomographic angiography); medication exposure throughout the observation
period; comorbidities; and demographics. The primary end point was the
development of renal failure (RF) (defined as NFK stage 4 or 5). Analysis was
performed with the use of a shared frailty model with clustering at the patient
level.
RESULTS: Patients (n = 1274) had a mean follow-up of 5.8 (range, 2.2-14) years.
In the multivariate model with RF as the dependent variable and after adjusting
for the statistically significant covariates of baseline renal function (hazard
ratio [HR], 0.95; P < .001), diabetes (HR, 1.8; P = .007), use of an
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (HR, 0.63; P = .03), use of antiplatelets
(HR, 0.5; P = .01), cumulative number of open vascular operations performed (HR, 
1.2; P = .001), and congestive heart failure (HR, 3.2; P < .001), CIVCE remained 
an independent predictor for RF development (HR, 1.1; P < .001). In the
multivariate survival analysis model and after adjusting for the statistically
significant covariates of perioperative myocardial infarction (HR, 3.9; P <
.001), age at entry in the cohort (HR, 1.05; P = .035), total number of open
operations (HR, 1.51; P < .001), and serum albumin (HR, 0.47; P < .001), CIVCE
was an independent predictor of death (HR, 1.07; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative IV contrast exposure is an independent predictor of RF
and death in patients with occlusive and aneurysmal vascular disease.

The increase proportion of older persons is continuously growing in worldwide,
especially in Japan. Subsequently, the number of older adults with type 2
diabetes is also increasing. Older adults with diabetes are at substantial risk
of frailty, cognitive impairment, and physical disability. They are also at
greater risk for polypharmacy, depression, urinary incontinence, injurious fall, 
and persistent pain. Thus, older patients are a very heterogenous group of
individuals. Hypoglycemia is a frequent adverse effect of treatment with
sulfonylurea, glinides, or insulin in older adults with diabetes. In this review,
we describe the efficacy and safety of some anti-diabetic oral agents used in
older adults with type 2 diabetes, including an incretin-based drug dipeptidyl
peptidase 4(DPP4) inhibitors.

Thoughtful decision-making in a patient with cancer and kidney disease requires a
comprehensive discussion of prognosis and therapy options for both conditions
framed by the individual's preferences and goals of care. An estimate of overall 
prognosis is generated that includes the patient's clinical presentation and
parameters associated with adverse outcomes, such as age, performance status,
frailty, malnutrition, and comorbidities. Empathic communication of this
information using a shared decision-making approach can lead to an informed
decision that respects patient autonomy and is consistent with the patient's
"big-picture" goals and personal values.

OBJECTIVE: Despite demonstration of the superior outcomes of transcatheter aortic
valve implantation (TAVI) versus optimal medical therapy for severe left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, studies comparing TAVI and surgical aortic
valve replacement (AVR) in this high-risk group have been lacking.
METHODS: We performed propensity matching for age, gender, baseline
comorbidities, previous interventions, priority at hospital admission, frailty
score, New York Heart Association class, EuroSCORE, and associated cardiac
diseases. Next, the 30-day mortality and procedure-related morbidity of 162
patients (81 TAVI vs 81 AVR) with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(ejection fraction ≤ 35%) were analyzed at the Italian National Institute of
Health.
RESULTS: The 30-day mortality was comparable (P = .37) between the 2 groups. The 
incidence of periprocedural acute myocardial infarction (P = .55), low output
state (P = .27), stroke (P = .36), and renal dysfunction (peak creatinine level, 
P = .57) was also similar between the 2 groups. TAVI resulted in significantly
greater postprocedural permanent pacemaker implantation (P = .01) and AVR in more
periprocedural transfusions (P < .01) despite a similar transfusion rate per
patient (2.8 ± 3.7 for TAVI vs 4.4 ± 3.8 for AVR; P = .08). The postprocedural
intensive care unit stay (median, 2 days after TAVI vs 3 days after AVR; P =
.34), intermediate care unit stay (median, 0 days after both TAVI and AVR; P =
.94), and hospitalization (median, 11 days after TAVI vs 14 days after AVR; P =
.51) were comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, both 
TAVI and AVR are valid treatment options, with comparable hospital mortality and 
periprocedural morbidity. Comparisons of the mid- to long-term outcomes are
mandatory.

BACKGROUND: Frailty, a multidimensional syndrome entailing loss of energy,
physical ability, cognition, and health, plays a significant role in elderly
morbidity and mortality. No study has examined frailty in relation to mortality
after femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We examined the association of a modified frailty index
abbreviated from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index to 1- and
2-year mortality rates after a femoral neck fracture. Specifically we examined:
(1) Is there an association of a modified frailty index with 1- and 2-year
mortality rates in patients aged 60 years and older who sustain a low-energy
femoral neck fracture? (2) Do the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
indicate that the modified frailty index can be a potential tool predictive of
mortality and does a specific modified frailty index value demonstrate increased 
odds ratio for mortality? (3) Do any of the individual clinical deficits
comprising the modified frailty index independently associate with mortality?
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 697 low-energy femoral neck fractures in
patients aged 60 years and older at our Level I trauma center from 2005 to 2009. 
A total of 218 (31%) patients with high-energy or pathologic fracture,
postoperative complication including infection or revision surgery, fracture of
the contralateral hip, or missing documented mobility status were excluded. The
remaining 481 patients, with a mean age of 81.2 years, were included. Mortality
data were obtained from a state vital statistics department using date of birth
and Social Security numbers. Statistical analysis included unequal variance
t-test, Pearson correlation of age and frailty, ROC curves and area under the
curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics, and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: One-year mortality analysis found the mean modified frailty index was
higher in patients who died (4.6 ± 1.8) than in those who lived (3.0 ± 2; p <
0.001), which was maintained in a 2-year mortality analysis (4.4 ± 1.8 versus 3.0
± 2; p < 0.001). In ROC analysis, the area under the curve was 0.74 and 0.72 for 
1- and 2-year mortality, respectively. Patients with a modified frailty index of 
4 or greater had an odds ratio of 4.97 for 1-year mortality and an odds ratio of 
4.01 for 2-year mortality as compared with patients with less than 4. Logistic
regression models demonstrated that the clinical deficits of mobility,
respiratory, renal, malignancy, thyroid, and impaired cognition were
independently associated with 1- and 2-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients aged 60 years and older sustaining a femoral neck fracture,
with a higher modified frailty index, had increased 1- and 2-year mortality
rates, and the ROC analysis suggests that this tool may be predictive of
mortality. Patients with a modified frailty index of 4 or greater have increased 
risk for mortality at 1 and 2 years. Clinical deficits of mobility, respiratory, 
renal, malignancy, thyroid, and impaired cognition also may be independently
associated with mortality. The modified frailty index may be a useful tool in
predicting mortality, guiding patient and family expectations and elucidating
implant/surgery choices. Further prospective studies are necessary to strengthen 
the predictive power of the index.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical
function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness
and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a
heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of
this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general
population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science,
CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD
and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text
review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. 
From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in
patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with
increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. 
In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher 
risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished
physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may 
lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to
understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with
clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of falls, with
subsequent complications including fractures, loss of independence,
hospitalization, and institutionalization. Factors associated with falls are
poorly understood in this population. We hypothesized that insights derived from 
studies of the elderly might apply to adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis;
we focused on frailty, a phenotype of physiological decline strongly associated
with falls in the elderly.
METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study of 95 patients undergoing
hemodialysis (1/2009-3/2010), the association of frailty with future falls was
explored using adjusted Poisson regression. Frailty was classified using the
criteria established by Fried et al., as a combination of five components:
shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed.
RESULTS: Over a median 6.7-month period of longitudinal follow-up, 28.3% of study
participants (25.9% of those under 65, 29.3% of those 65 and older) experienced a
fall. After adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidity, disability, number of
medications, marital status, and education, frailty independently predicted a
3.09-fold (95% CI: 1.38-6.90, P=0.006) higher number of falls. This relationship 
between frailty and falls did not differ for younger and older adults (P=0.57).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, a validated construct in the elderly, was a strong and
independent predictor of falls in adults undergoing hemodialysis, regardless of
age. Our results may aid in identifying frail hemodialysis patients who could be 
targeted for multidimensional fall prevention strategies.

Studies Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

Needing assistance with activities of daily living (ADL) is an early indicator of
functional decline and has important implications for individuals' quality of
life. However, correlates of need for ADL assistance have received limited
attention among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD). A multicenter 
cohort of 742 prevalent HD patients was assessed in 2009-2011 and classified as
frail, prefrail and nonfrail by the Fried frailty index (recent unintentional
weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk speed, low
physical activity). Patients reported need for assistance with 4 ADL tasks and
identified contributing symptoms/conditions (pain, balance, endurance, weakness, 
others). Nearly 1 in 5 patients needed assistance with 1 or more ADL.
Multivariable analysis showed increased odds for needing ADL assistance among
frail (odds ratio [OR] 11.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.50-23.41; P < 0.001)
and prefrail (OR 1.93; 95% CI 1.01-3.68; P = 0.046) compared with non-frail
patients. In addition, the odds for needing ADL assistance were lower among
blacks compared with whites and were higher among patients with diabetes, lung
disease, and stroke. Balance, weakness, and "other" (frequently dialysis-related)
symptoms/conditions were the most frequently named reasons for ADL difficulty. In
addition to interventions such as increasing physical activity that might delay
or reverse the process of frailty, the immediate symptoms/conditions to which
individuals attribute their ADL difficulty may have clinical relevance for
developing targeted management and/or treatment approaches.

BACKGROUND: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated
risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly
associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and
frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established.
METHODS: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test
of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of
frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting
for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for
the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty
status.
RESULTS: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49
(36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of
participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for 
eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61
points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all
comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p
= 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated with worse frailty
status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).
CONCLUSIONS: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and
frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD
patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted
interventions.

Displaced intracapsular fractures of the neck of femur are routinely treated in
the elderly with either cemented or uncemented hemiarthroplasty. Recent evidence 
suggests a superior outcome with the use of cement, but uncemented prostheses are
still employed for those with multiple co-morbidities or particular frailty. In
Scotland, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recommendations 
are used to identify which patients should receive a cemented prosthesis. These
are simply based upon the presence of cardiorespiratory disease, particularly in 
the frail elderly patient. Between January 2007 and June 2010, a total of 1397
patients with neck-of-femur fractures presented to our unit. Retrospective
analysis was performed with particular attention given to the rate of
postoperative periprosthetic fracture. As many as 546 fractures were treated with
hemiarthroplasty, of which 183 were treated with a cemented Exeter Trauma Stem
(ETS) and 363 were treated with an uncemented Austin-Moore prosthesis (AMP). At
the time of our retrospective analysis, we found that 15 (4%) patients treated
with an uncemented prosthesis went on to sustain a periprosthetic fracture. There
were no periprosthetic fractures in the cemented group (p=0.004). Data analysis
by case-note review of those patients sustaining a periprosthetic fracture was
then performed. Seven (50%) suffered from confusion secondary to dementia, six
(43%) had a history of significant cardiac disease (recent myocardial infarction 
(MI) or cardiac failure) and two (14%) had known renal impairment. The mean time 
to fracture after uncemented hemiarthroplasty was 2 years. The majority (80%)
were fractures which required further surgery. Revision surgery in these patients
was associated with an overall complication rate of 42% (mainly deep infection
and haemorrhage requiring transfusion). Two of the patients had a fracture that
could be treated conservatively. It is concluded that, in conjunction with the
treating senior anaesthetist, cemented implants should be considered in all
patients, especially those who are deemed to be frail and with multiple
co-morbidities. A periprosthetic fracture rate of 14% at a mean of 2 years after 
uncemented hemiarthroplasty represents a potentially unacceptable risk for such a
frail population. In particular, we feel that the AMP should not be used for
treating displaced intracapsular neck-of-femur fractures.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether higher cystatin C would be associated with
greater frailty in men aged 65 and older.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study.
SETTING: Six U.S. sites.
PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of community-dwelling men aged 65 and older
enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study (mean age 73.8; 9.8%
frail and 47.2% intermediate frailty; N = 1,602).
MEASUREMENTS: Serum cystatin C, creatinine, and frailty were measured. Frailty
was analyzed as an ordinal outcome of robust, intermediate frailty, and frail
using a multinomial logistic regression model, and the base model was adjusted
for age, race, and clinical site.
RESULTS: Higher cystatin C was associated with seven times greater odds of being 
frail than being robust (odds ratio (OR) quartile 4 vs 1 = 7.12, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 3.76-13.46) and 2.4 times greater odds of intermediate frailty
than robust (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.70-3.32). The association was 
attenuated but persisted after adjusting for multiple possible confounders. In
contrast, neither higher serum creatinine (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.36, 95% CI =
0.78-2.40) nor lower creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR
quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.54-1.87) was associated in a graded manner
with greater odds of frailty.
CONCLUSION: Higher cystatin C, but not creatinine-based measures, was associated 
with greater odds of frailty in this cohort of older men.

Evidence has recently been building that the presence of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is an independent contributor to decline in physical and cognitive
functions in older adults. CKD affects 45% of persons older than 70 years of age 
and can double the risk for physical impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and
frailty. To increase awareness of this relatively new concept of CKD as a risk
factor for accelerated aging, we review studies on the association of CKD with
physical function, frailty, and cognitive function. We also present a summary of 
the proposed mechanisms for these associations.

An appropriate treatment of elderly rheumatic patients implements comprehensive
diagnostics and exclusion diagnostics of e.g. coronary heart disease,
osteoporosis, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2 and thyroid gland
dysfunction. Furthermore, the complex disease situation might require the
integration of other faculties or might be a reason for inpatient treatment. The 
complexity in the treatment of multimorbid elderly patients suffering from
rheumatism not only rises with increasing age but also constitutes a considerable
challenge due to existing incapacities and preceding as well as currently
performed immunosuppressive therapies. The necessary treatment framework is
outlined from the perspective of rheumatologists and geriatricians. Typical
geriatric symptoms, such as malnutrition, immobility and frailty might be
enhanced if multimorbidity is simultaneously present.

BACKGROUND: Despite the widespread use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation
(TAVI), the role of sex on outcome after TAVI or surgical aortic valve
replacement (AVR) has been poorly investigated. We investigated the impact of sex
on outcome after TAVI or AVR.
METHODS: There were 2108 patients undergoing TAVI or AVR who were enrolled in the
Italian Observational Multicenter Registry (OBSERVANT). Thirty-day mortality,
major periprocedural morbidity, and transprosthetic gradients were stratified by 
sex according to interventions.
RESULTS: Female AVR patients showed a worse risk profile compared with male AVR
patients, given the higher mean age, prevalence of frailty score of 2 or higher, 
New York Heart Association class of 3 or higher, lower body weight, and
preoperative hemoglobin level (P ≤ .02). Similarly, female TAVI patients had a
different risk profile than male TAVI patients, given a higher age and a lower
body weight and preoperative hemoglobin level (P ≤ .005), but with a similar New 
York Heart Association class, frailty score, EuroSCORE (P = NS), a better left
ventricular ejection fraction and a lower prevalence of left ventricular ejection
fraction less than 30%, porcelain aorta, renal dysfunction, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, arteriopathy, and previous cardiovascular surgery or
percutaneous coronary intervention (P ≤ .01). Women showed a smaller aortic
annulus than men in both populations (P < .001). Female sex was an independent
predictor in the AVR population for risk-adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio
[OR], 2.34; P = .043) and transfusions (OR, 1.47; P = .003), but not for
risk-adjusted acute myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular complications,
permanent atrioventricular block (P = NS). Female sex was an independent
predictor in the TAVI population for risk-adjusted major vascular complications
(OR, 2.92; P = .018) and transfusions (OR, 1.93; P = .003), but proved protective
against moderate to severe postprocedural aortic insufficiency (P = .018).
CONCLUSIONS: Female sex is a risk factor for mortality after aortic valve
replacement, for major vascular complications after TAVI, and for transfusions
after both approaches.

Bone fracture risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher
than that in healthy subjects. Frailty caused by neuromuscular impairment as well
as bone fragility due to bone loss and impaired bone quality is thought to be
involved in the elevated fracture risk in CKD. Altered material and structural
properties might be attributed to the reduced bone strength. The structural
properties in CKD patients are characterized in 1) cortical thinning and cortical
porosity, and 2) irregular thickening and loss of connectivity in trabecular
bone. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that skeletal changes in the
structural properties may be initiated at earlier stage of CKD than we expected.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and serious condition in the elderly. AF
affects between 600,000 and one million patients in France, two-thirds of whom
are aged above 75 years. AF is a predictive factor for mortality in the elderly
and a major risk factor for stroke. Co-morbidities are frequent and worsen the
prognosis. The management of AF in the elderly should involve a comprehensive
geriatric assessment (CGA), which analyses both medical and psychosocial
elements, enabling evaluation of the patient's functional status and social
situation and the identification of co-morbidities. The CGA enables the detection
of "frailty" using screening tools assessing cognitive function, risk of falls,
nutritional status, mood disorders, autonomy and social environment. The
objectives of AF treatment in the elderly are to prevent AF complications,
particularly stroke, and improve quality of life. Specific precautions for
treatment must be taken because of the co-morbidities and age-related changes in 
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Preventing AF complications relies mainly
on anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulants are recommended in patients with AF aged
75 years or above after assessing the bleeding risk using the HEMORR2HAGES or
HAS-BLED scores. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are promising treatments,
especially due to a lower risk of intracerebral haemorrhage. However, their
prescriptions should take into account renal function (creatinine clearance
assessed with Cockcroft formula) and cognitive function (for adherence to
treatment). Studies including frail patients in "real life" are necessary to
evaluate tolerance of NOACs. Management of AF also involves the treatment of
underlying cardiomyopathy and heart rate control rather than a rhythm-control
strategy as first-line therapy for elderly patients, especially if they are
paucisymptomatic. Antiarrhythmic drugs should be used carefully in elderly
patients because of the frequency of metabolic abnormalities and higher risk of
drug interactions and bradycardia.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Uromodulin-associated kidney disease (UAKD) is an
autosomal dominant disease caused by uromodulin (UMOD) gene mutations. This study
explored genotype-phenotype correlations by examining the relationship between
the type of UMOD mutation and the age at onset of ESRD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: Extensive bibliographic research
was used to ascertain patient-level data of all patients with UAKD published up
to October 2011. Data included sex; ages at onset of hyperuricemia, gout, and
ESRD; and UMOD genotype. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards
models fitted with shared gamma frailty terms to adjust for within-family
correlations were used to model time to event.
RESULTS: Thirty-one peer-reviewed publications reporting on 202 patients from 74 
families with 59 different UMOD mutations were included. Median ages at onset of 
hyperuricemia, gout, and ESRD were 24, 40, and 56 years, respectively. Men
developed gout and ESRD significantly earlier than did women (age at ESRD was 50 
years for men and 60 for women; P=0.04, shared frailty model). Median ages at
ESRD development were lowest with Cys77Tyr (37.5 years) and highest with
Gln316Pro (65.5 years) UMOD mutations. Onset of ESRD was significantly earlier
with UMOD mutations located within the epidermal growth factor domains 2 and 3
(range, 45-52 years; P<0.01 and 0.04, respectively) compared with the
cysteine-rich domains (range, 60-65 years; by shared frailty model).
CONCLUSIONS: The UMOD genotype is related to the clinical phenotype of UAKD. This
finding may assist in counseling of patients.

The panoply of treatment algorithms, periodically released to improve guidance,
is one mean to face therapeutic uncertainty in pharmacological management of
hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, especially after metformin failure. Failure of 
recent guidelines to give advice on the use of specific antidiabetic drugs in
patients with co-morbidity may generate further uncertainty, given the frequent
association of type 2 diabetes with common comorbidity, including, although not
limited to obesity, cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, and frailty.
The Italian Association of Diabetologists (Associazione Medici Diabetologi, AMD) 
recognized the need to develop personalized treatment plans for people with type 
2 diabetes, taking into account the patients' individual profile (phenotype),
with the objective of the safest possible glycemic control. As not every subject 
with type 2 diabetes benefits from intensive glycemic control, flexible regimens 
of treatment with diabetes drugs (including insulin) are needed for reaching
individualized glycemic goals. Whether personalized diabetology will improve the 
quality healthcare practice of diabetes management is unknown, but specific
research has been launched.

The microcirculation plays an important role in bone health. Here, we examine
whether albuminuria, a marker of renal microvascular disease, is associated with 
the risk of hip fracture in older adults (age, 78 years). We find a small
independent association in women but not in men.INTRODUCTION: The microvascular
circulation plays an important role in bone physiology. Two studies of
middle-aged adults have found that albuminuria (>30 mg albumin/g creatinine), a
disorder of the renal microvasculature, is associated with fracture risk. Here,
we examine whether albuminuria is related to hip fracture risk and reduced hip
bone mineral density (BMD) in older adults with a mean age of 78 years.
METHODS: From the Cardiovascular Health Study (41 % male), 3,110 adults with
albuminuria testing were followed up for incident hip fracture for up to
9.5 years. BMD was performed in a subset of 1,208 participants.
RESULTS: There were 313 hip fractures during follow-up (7.7 % of men; 11.7 % of
women). The incidence rate for men, with and without albuminuria, was 1.43 and
0.93/100 person-years of follow-up (p = 0.02); for women, 1.84 and 1.33
(p = 0.04). After adjustment for osteoporosis-related factors, frailty and
falling, a doubling of albuminuria was significantly associated with hip fracture
risk in women (hazard ratio, 1.12, 95 % CI, 1.001-1.25), but not in men. In the
subcohort with BMD measurement, increased urine albumin levels were significantly
associated with decreased total hip BMD in men (-0.009 g calcium/cm(2) (-0.017,
-0.001); p = 0.04), but not in women.
CONCLUSIONS: In older women, albuminuria is associated with a small, but
statistically significant, increased risk of hip fracture independent of other
explanatory factors. No such risk appears to be present in men, although their
total hip BMD is lower in association with albuminuria.

The EVEREST II trial investigated the MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Menlo Park, CA)
in patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing surgical procedures.
Although mitral stenosis was not reported in this cohort, this trial excluded
patients receiving dialysis. We report a case of a 43-year-old HIV-positive,
dialysis-dependent patient with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and severe MR, who was
considered at high operative risk because of frailty. She was treated with a
MitraClip as part of the REALISM high-risk registry. Her symptomatic MR improved 
but severe symptomatic mitral stenosis developed 28 months after the MitraClip
procedure. At that point, she was felt to be a better operative candidate but
required open mitral valve replacement. Pathologic examination demonstrated
significant calcification of the leaflets around the MitraClip devices.

CKD is associated with impairments in health status, physical function, and
frailty. The aim of the current prospective cohort study was to determine whether
CKD predicted new LTCI need certification among community-dwelling older Japanese
adults. This was a prospective cohort study. We analyzed the cohort data from a
prospective study, The Japan Multicenter Aging Cohort for Care Prevention
(J-MACC). We followed 8063 elderly adults for 2 years, and we analyzed the
relationship between CKD and LTCI need. The outcome studied was new certification
for LTCI service need during a 2-year period. We measured serum creatinine (the
estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR), serum albumin, frailty checklist
scores, and body mass index. During the 2-year follow-up, 536 subjects (6.6%)
were newly certified as needing LTCI services. We stratified the cohort according
to eGFR quartile and performed multivariate analyses using an eGFR value of
71.4-83.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) as a reference. We found that subjects with eGFR
values <60.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) had a significantly elevated risk of LTCI service
need (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.44 [95% CI 1.12-1.86]). Our results indicate that 
CKD is independently associated with new LTCI service need certification and is
an important marker of frailty in older adults.

Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of
Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and
catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate
with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and
provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of
PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology
of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition)
due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent 
factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include
uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent
inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of
hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition,
comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the
dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW.

BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in management have been highlighted as contributory
factors in the death of many patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). However,
there is little evidence addressing the quality of care provided to patients with
milder AKI.
AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of care provided to a
non-select cohort of patients with AKI and evaluate discrepancies in causation,
recognition and management.
DESIGN: Retrospective inception cohort study.
METHODS: Demographic data were collected for all 1577 patients admitted to a
University Teaching Hospital during a 1-month period. Baseline, admission and
peak creatinine were correlated with mortality and length of hospital admission. 
AKI was classified according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
criteria. A retrospective case note review of all patients with AKI was carried
out to evaluate quality of documentation and clinical management of AKI.
Multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors for AKI.
RESULTS: Incidence of AKI on admission was 4.6%. A further 10.3% developed AKI
while in hospital. All cause mortality was 4-fold higher among patients with AKI 
compared with those without (19 vs. 3.8%; P < 0.001). Mortality was significantly
higher in those patients who developed AKI while an in-patient compared with
those with AKI on admission (27.3 vs. 11.8%; P < 0.001). Diabetes, clinician
perception of frailty, age and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor prior to admission were found to be independent risk factors for AKI.
AKI was unrecognized in 23.5% of patients, two-thirds of whom were discharged
without resolution of renal function. Significant weaknesses in management were
poorly kept fluid balance charts (48.2%), failure to withhold nephrotoxic drugs
(38.8%) and failure to act upon abnormal biochemistry (41%) in a timely fashion.
CONCLUSION: AKI is common in hospitalized patients and associated with a
significant increase in hospital stay and mortality. AKI is often found in
conjunction with other organ failure and in many cases is not preventable.
Nevertheless clinicians need to be more vigilant of small creatinine rises to
permit early intervention particularly among elderly and frail patients.

The present study examined the association between patient-reported anxiety and
postcardiac surgery mortality and major morbidity. Frailty Assessment Before
Cardiac Surgery was a prospective multicenter cohort study of elderly patients
undergoing cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass surgery and/or valve repair or
replacement) at 4 tertiary care hospitals from 2008 to 2009. The patients were
evaluated a mean of 2 days preoperatively with the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale, a validated questionnaire assessing depression and anxiety in
hospitalized patients. The primary predictor variable was a high level of
anxiety, defined by a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score of ≥ 11. The
main outcome measure was all-cause mortality or major morbidity (e.g., stroke,
renal failure, prolonged ventilation, deep sternal wound infection, or
reoperation) occurring during the index hospitalization. Multivariable logistic
regression analysis examined the association between high preoperative anxiety
and all-cause mortality/major morbidity, adjusting for the Society of Thoracic
Surgeons predicted risk, age, gender, and depression symptoms. A total of 148
patients (mean age 75.8 ± 4.4 years; 34% women) completed the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale. High levels of preoperative anxiety were present in 7% of
patients. No differences were found in the type of surgery and Society of
Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk across the preoperative levels of anxiety. After
adjusting for potential confounders, high preoperative anxiety was remained
independently predictive of postoperative mortality or major morbidity (odds
ratio 5.1, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 20.2; p = 0.02). In conclusion,
although high levels of anxiety were present in few patients anticipating cardiac
surgery, this conferred a strong and independent heightened risk of mortality or 
major morbidity.

Next to a high morbidity, patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) suffer
from a complex spectrum of clinical manifestations. Both the phenotype of
patients with ESRD as well as the pathophysiology of uremia show interesting
parallels with the general aging process. Phenotypically, patients with ESRD have
an increased susceptibility for both cardiovascular as well as infectious disease
and show a reduction in functional capacity as well as muscular mass
(sarcopenia), translating into a high prevalence of frailty also in younger
patients. Pathophysiologically, the immune dysfunction, telomere attrition and
the presence of low-grade inflammation in uremic patients also show parallels
with the aging process. System models of aging, such as the homeodynamic model
and reliability theory of Gavrilov may also have relevance for ESRD. The
reduction in the redundancy of compensatory mechanisms and the multisystem
impairment in ESRD explain the rapid loss of homeodynamic/homeostatic balance and
the increased susceptibility to external stressors in these patients. System
theories may also explain the relative lack of success of interventions focusing 
on single aspects of renal disease. The concept of accelerated aging, which also 
shares similarities with other organ diseases, may be of relevance both for a
better understanding of the uremic process, as well as for the design of
multidimensional interventions in ESRD patients, including an important role for 
early rehabilitation. Research into processes akin to both aging and uremia may
result in novel therapeutic approaches.

BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be
associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Given the high
prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD in the general population, in depth analysis
of this association is warranted.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We pooled individual participant data from 5 community-based
cohorts from Europe (second Nord-Trøndelag Health Study [HUNT2], Prevention of
Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease [PREVEND], and the Tromsø study) and the
United States (Atherosclerosis Risks in Communities [ARIC] and Cardiovascular
Health Study [CHS]) to assess the association of estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and CKD with objectively verified VTE. To estimate
adjusted hazard ratios for VTE, categorical and continuous spline models were fit
by using Cox regression with shared-frailty or random-effect meta-analysis. A
total of 1178 VTE events occurred over 599 453 person-years follow-up. Relative
to eGFR 100 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), hazard ratios for VTE were 1.29 (95% confidence
interval, 1.04-1.59) for eGFR 75, 1.31 (1.00-1.71) for eGFR 60, 1.82 (1.27-2.60) 
for eGFR 45, and 1.95 (1.26-3.01) for eGFR 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). In comparison
with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 5.0 mg/g, the hazard ratios for VTE 
were 1.34 (1.04-1.72) for ACR 30 mg/g, 1.60 (1.08-2.36) for ACR 300 mg/g, and
1.92 (1.19-3.09) for ACR 1000 mg/g. There was no interaction between clinical
categories of eGFR and ACR (P=0.20). The adjusted hazard ratio for CKD, defined
as eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or albuminuria ≥30 mg/g, (versus no CKD) was
1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.06). Associations were consistent in
subgroups according to age, sex, and comorbidities, and for unprovoked versus
provoked VTE, as well.
CONCLUSIONS: Both eGFR and ACR are independently associated with increased risk
of VTE in the general population, even across the normal eGFR and ACR ranges.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a physiological vulnerability status of the patient
which is associated with the increased number of hospitalization and death.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of frailty and its associated factors in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on conservative treatment (CT),
hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).
METHODS: Frailty was assessed in 146 patients (86 CT, 37 HD and 23 PD) and
characterized as muscle weakness and exhaustion--by the physical aspect and
vitality domains, respectively, evaluated in the SF-36 quality of life
instrument; physical inactivity--if he or she answered "never" or "hardly ever"
when asked about physical activity; and as unintentional weight loss (> 4.5 kg
per year). Patients were divided into three groups: non-fragile (NF), pre-fragile
(PF) and fragile (F). The demographic, clinical and laboratory data were
extracted from patient charts.
RESULTS: Frailty was diagnosed in 36% of patients on CT, 37.8% in HD and 47.8% in
PD. It was characterized in 36.8% of patients aged between 20 and 40 years and
40.3% of those between 41 and 60 years. Frailty was significantly associated with
the use of vitamin D (r = 0.16; p = 0.03), hemoglobin (r = -0.14; p = - 0.02) and
intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.16; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is common among patients with CKD on conservative treatment 
and dialysis, even in those who are not elderly. In the patients studied, the
phenotype of frailty was associated with no usage of vitamin D, lower serum
levels of hemoglobin and higher levels of parathyroid hormone.

BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and
its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we
hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between
earlier dialysis initiation and mortality.
METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis
Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident
patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for
vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization
through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the 
association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards
regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization.
RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73%.
In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with 
higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25-1.97]; P < .001) and time to first
hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45]; P < .001). While higher eGFR at
dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23]
per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically
significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the 
United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation.
Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier
initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described
association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.

Ghrelin as a human natural hormone is involved in fundamental regulatory
processes of eating and energy balance. Ghrelin signals the nutrient availability
from the gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system, up-regulates food 
intake and lowers energy expenditure mainly through hypothalamic mediators acting
both centrally and peripherally including the gastrointestinal tract (motility,
epithelium), promotes both neuro-endocrine and inflammatory signals to increase
skeletal muscle growth and decrease protein breakdown, and increases lipolysis
while body fat utilization is reduced. Ghrelin does more to exert its probably
sentinel role around "human energy": it influences through mainly
extra-hypothalamic actions the hedonic and incentive value of food, mood and
anxiety, sleep-wake regulation, learning and memory, and neurogenesis. Recently
numerous ghrelin gene-derived peptides were discovered, demonstrating the
complexity within the ghrelin/ghrelin receptor axis. For clinical applications,
not only the natural ghrelin and its slice variants, but also several modified or
artificial molecules acting at ghrelin-associated receptors were and are
developed. Current clinical applications are limited to clinical studies,
focusing mainly on cachexia in chronic heart failure, COPD, cancer, endstage-
renal-disease or cystic fibrosis, but also on frailty in elderly,
gastrointestinal motility (e.g., gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia,
postoperative ileus), after curative gastrectomy, anorexia nervosa, growth
hormone deficient patients, alcohol craving, sleep-wake regulation (e.g. major
depression), or sympathetic nervous activity in obesity. The results of
completed, preliminary studies support the clinical potential of ghrelin, ghrelin
gene-derived peptides, and artificial analogues, suggesting that larger clinical 
trials are demanded to move ghrelin towards an available and reimbursed
pharmaceutical intervention.

Testosterone levels decrease with age. This decline is steeper during "critical
illnesses". Cardiac surgery is a particular representative model of major
clinical condition producing stress responses similar to those observed during
severe nonsurgical illness. Cardiac revascularization with extracorporeal
circulation is characterized by marked postoperative complications such as
insulin resistance, a pro-inflammatory state, acute anemia and renal dysfunction.
These phenomena are more evident in older subjects, who are particularly
vulnerable in the post-operative state, a condition that has been recently termed
as "acute postoperative frailty". We recently showed that in older men with low
ejection fraction undergoing cardiac revascularization with extracorporeal
circulation, there is a profound decline in anabolic hormones, including
testosterone. After surgery testosterone concentration frequently declines to
less than 200 ng/dl, a situation suggestive of overt hypogonadism. Since men with
low testosterone levels have a high probability of developing mobility
limitations, we considered this a rationale for the perioperative use of
testosterone treatment in older men undergoing cardiac revasularization surgery. 
We hypothesized that testosterone supplementation at this time might attenuate
the impressive post-surgical catabolic hormonal milieu. The aim of this
manuscript is to elucidate an ongoing randomized clinical trial in older men (70+
years old) undergoing elective cardiovascular revascularization with
extracorporeal circulation. This randomized clinical trial will evaluate the
effects of intramuscular testosterone administration on clinical and functional
outcomes in this population. The study will also address potential mechanisms
underlying the expected beneficial effects of testosterone supplementation
including improvement of insulin sensitivity, markers of inflammatory status and 
improved hemoglobin levels.

BACKGROUND: Organ dysfunctions and medical complications, such as renal failure, 
liver impairment, coagulation disorders, cardiovascular and respiratory
illnesses, may hamper an adequate pain management in haematological patients.
AIM: To summarize current knowledge on pain management in hematological patients 
presenting major organ dysfunctions and comorbidity. We also attempted to provide
recommendations to optimize analgesia and to minimize side effects in the setting
of medically compromised and frail haematological patients.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literature, using relevant key words, was
conducted in PubMed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Pain in hematological patients is a common symptom and
is often multi-factorial. Most pharmacotherapeutic measures, including causal
therapies, analgesics and adjuvant agents routinely applied in pain management,
may also be used in the setting of clinical frailty and medical comorbidities;
however, comprehensive clinical and functional patient's evaluations and a
careful consideration of expected benefits and potential adverse events are
required.

Memorial Hospital, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: The risk of herpes zoster in the dialysis population relative to the 
general population is not known. The aim of this study was to perform a
population-based cohort study to investigate the risk of herpes zoster after the 
initiation of hemodialysis therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) in Taiwan, a country with the highest incidence of ESRD in the world.
STUDY DESIGN: Matched cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health
Insurance Research Database. 843 patients who were beginning hemodialysis therapy
in 1999-2003 were included as the study cohort and 3,372 patients without ESRD
matched for age and sex were included as a comparison cohort. A multivariate
frailty Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to adjust for
confounding and compare the 6-year herpes zoster-free survival rate between these
2 cohorts.
PREDICTORS: Hemodialysis.
OUTCOMES: Herpes zoster.
RESULTS: Mean years of follow-up were 4.73 and 5.49 for the hemodialysis and
comparison cohorts, respectively. 868 patients developed herpes zoster throughout
the study period, 294 from the hemodialysis cohort and 574 from the comparison
cohort. The incidence rate of herpes zoster (73.34 events/1,000 person-year) was 
significantly higher in the hemodialysis cohort than in the control cohort (31.03
events/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for potential confounders, the
adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.72-2.27).
LIMITATIONS: We expect that some patients with mild zoster chose not to seek
medical help.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients treated with long-term hemodialysis are at
an increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population.

PURPOSE: Hydration and urinary alkalinization are essential for reducing renal
dysfunction with high dose methotrexate (HDMTX). This report presents an analysis
of institutional methods used to achieve adequate urinary alkalinization and
output for patients receiving single agent HDMTX. Renal and metabolic parameters 
of tolerance were examined.
METHODS: Medical records of adult patients receiving HDMTX during the calendar
years of 2008-2009 were retrospectively reviewed to determine the time to achieve
urine pH > 7. Number of hospital days, bicarbonate dose, ordered hydration rate, 
urine output, and urine pH were assessed. A survival analysis model was run for
time to urine pH > 7 using preadmission oral bicarbonate as a predictor variable 
and including a frailty term. Observational statistics were performed for other
parameters.
RESULTS: The analysis included 79 encounters for ten patients. Urine pH > 7 was
achieved more rapidly in patients receiving preadmission oral bicarbonate
(P = 0.012). The number of patients receiving HDMTX on the same day as admission 
was greater for those receiving preadmission oral bicarbonate (47%) in comparison
to those who did not (2%), and they spent less time in the hospital. A standard
regimen for hydration and urinary alkalinization based on this project is
reported. The nature and frequency of adverse events were as expected for this
treatment.
CONCLUSION: At our institution, the time to achieve urinary alkalinization was
reduced for patients receiving preadmission oral bicarbonate which facilitated
chemotherapy infusion on the same day as admission and decreased the number of
calendar days that patients stayed in the hospital.

Older patients on dialysis have unique needs and characteristics and their
outcomes vary from that of their younger counterparts. Comparatively fewer will
start or be maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to younger patients, 
despite the fact that hemodialysis is often poorly tolerated. Barriers to PD for 
older patients include poor vision, frailty, cognitive dysfunction, accommodation
issues, and a bias from renal teams that older patients cannot do PD. The
development of assisted PD can overcome many of these barriers. The ability of
older patients to use PD as their dialysis modality should not be determined by
whether they live in an area where the nephrologist is a PD enthusiast. All
patients should be given nonbiased information so they can choose the dialysis
modality that gives them the best quality of life and suits their and their
family's lifestyle.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has a
positive predictive value for postoperative delirium (POD) after vascular
surgery.
METHODS: Between March and August 2010, 142 consecutive vascular surgery patients
were prospectively evaluated. Preoperatively, the GFI was obtained and
postoperatively patients were screened with the Delirium Observation Scale (DOS).
Patients with a DOS-score ≥3 points were assessed by a geriatrician. Delirium was
defined by the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Primary outcome variable was the incidence of 
POD. Secondary outcome variables were any surgical complication and hospital
length of stay (HLOS) (>7 days).
RESULTS: Ten patients (7%) developed POD. The highest incidence of POD was found 
after aortic surgery (17%) and amputation procedures (40%). Increased
comorbidities (p = 0.006), GFI score (p = 0.03), renal insufficiency (p = 0.04), 
elevated C-reactive protein (p = 0.008), high American Society of
Anaesthesiologists score (p = 0.05), a DOS-score of ≥3 points (p = 0.001),
post-operative intensive care unit admittance (p = 0.01) and HLOS ≥7 days (p =
0.005) were risk factors for POD. The GFI score was not associated with a
prolonged HLOS. A mean number of 2 ± 1 (range 0-5) complications were registered.
The receiver operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve for the GFI was 
0.70.
CONCLUSIONS: The GFI can be helpful in the early identification of POD after
vascular surgery in a select group of high-risk patients.

Physical inactivity contributes to the frailty and the decline in function that
develops over time among patients with end-stage renal disease. We assessed
physical activity among 1547 ambulatory patients new to dialysis in the United
States Renal Data System Comprehensive Dialysis Study. We used a self-reporting
Human Activity Profile that included Maximal and Adjusted Activity Scores and
compared results to established norms by age and gender. Physical activity was
found to be extremely low with scores for all age and gender categories below the
5th percentile of healthy individuals and 95% of patients had scores consonant
with low fitness. Older age, female gender, diabetes, atherosclerotic disease,
and a low level of education were associated with lower activity scores assessed 
by univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis. Higher serum albumin,
creatinine, and lower body mass index, but not hemoglobin levels, were associated
with greater physical activity. By multivariable analysis, patients on
hemodialysis using a catheter reported lower levels of physical activity compared
to those on peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis using an arteriovenous fistula, or 
with a graft. Lower Maximal and Adjusted Activity Scores were associated with
poor physical function and mental health. Hence, physical activity is
distressingly low among patients new to dialysis. Thus, strategies to enhance
activity in these patients should be explored.

Vitamin D deficiency: universal risk factor for multifactorial diseases?

In the Western world, the majority of morbidity and mortality are caused by
multifactorial diseases. Some risk factors are related to more than one type of
disease. These so-called universal risk factors are highly relevant to the
population, as reduction of universal risk factors may reduce the prevalence of
several types of multifactorial disease simultaneously. Vitamin D deficiency is
traditionally seen as an etiological factor in bone disorders such as rickets and
osteomalacia. Recent studies also suggest a role for vitamin D deficiency in
multifactorial disorders, including progressive renal function loss and
cardiovascular disease; it is also a risk factor for frailty. The potentially
pleiotropic effects of vitamin D analogues support the hypothesis that vitamin D 
deficiency is a universal risk factor. Here we review molecular actions of the
vitamin D receptor (VDR), to identify mechanisms and pathways for vitamin D
deficiency as a universal risk factor. To identify genes directly regulated by
the VDR, we searched for genes containing vitamin D response elements (VDREs). A 
further refinement was made by selecting only VDRE-containing genes with
documented modulation by VDR analogues in vivo. Our search yielded a limited
number of factors possibly related to pleiotropic effects of vitamin D, including
growth factors, hormones, inflammatory factors and factors related to calcium
homeostasis. Results from observational, intervention and mechanistic studies
indicate that vitamin D is a universal risk factor involved in diverse
multifactorial conditions. Further exploration of the multifaceted actions of
vitamin D may pave the way for disease-overriding intervention strategies.

Nephrologists care for an increasing number of elderly patients on hemodialysis. 
As such, an understanding of the overlap among complications of hemodialysis and 
geriatric syndromes is crucial. This article reviews hemodialysis management
issues including vascular access, hypertension, anemia and bone and mineral
disorders with an attention towards the distinct medical needs of the elderly.
Key concepts of geriatrics frailty, dementia and palliative care are also
discussed, as nephrologists frequently participate in decision-making directed
toward balancing longevity, functional status and the burden of therapy.

Comment in
    Circulation. 2010 May 4;121(17):1884-6.

BACKGROUND: The purported advantage of ABO-incompatible (ABO-I) listing is to
reduce wait times and wait-list mortality among infants awaiting heart
transplantation. We sought to describe recent trends in ABO-I listing for US
infants and to determine the impact of ABO-I listing on wait times and wait-list 
mortality.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study using Organ
Procurement and Transplant Network data, infants<12 months of age listed for
heart transplantation between 1999 and 2008 (n=1331) were analyzed. Infants
listed for an ABO-I transplant were compared with a propensity score-matched
cohort listed for an ABO-compatible transplant through the use of a Cox
shared-frailty model. The primary end point was time to heart transplantation.
The percentage of eligible infants listed for an ABO-I heart increased from 0%
before 2002 to 53% in 2007 (P<0.001 for trend). Compared with infants listed
exclusively for an ABO-compatible heart, infants with a primary ABO-I listing
strategy (n=235) were more likely to be listed 1A, to have congenital heart
disease and renal failure, and to require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
For the propensity score-matched groups (n=197 matched pairs), there was no
difference in wait-list mortality; however, infants with blood type O assigned an
ABO-I listing strategy were more likely to undergo heart transplantation by 30
days (31% versus 16%; P=0.007) with a less pronounced effect for infants with
other blood types.
CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of US infants listed for an ABO-I heart
transplantation has risen dramatically in recent years but still appears to be
preferentially used for sicker infant candidates. The ABO-I listing strategy is
associated with a higher likelihood of transplantation within 30 days for infants
with blood group O and may benefit a broader range of transplantation candidates.

Specific laboratory tests and physical findings are available to the practicing
clinician that should raise the suspicion of inflammation. Inflammation is
related to specific clinical outcomes. Once identified, changes in clinical
practice may affect the level of inflammation in individual and or groups of
dialysis patients with the hope that these changes may in turn affect outcome in 
a positive manner. Standard clinical tests and observations associated with
inflammation are hypoalbuminemia, erythropoietin resistance, decreased iron
saturation accompanied by high ferritin, frailty, low serum creatinine, reduced
total and LDL-cholesterol, and increased C reactive protein (CRP). Inflammation
is strongly associated with loss of physical function, dyslipidemia (low LDL- and
HDL-cholesterol, increased triglycerides), and anemia that is unresponsive to
erythropoietin. Inflammation is associated with cardiovascular events, increased 
hospitalization, and death. Correctible causes of inflammation are tunneled
dialysis catheters, arteriovenous grafts, catheter infection, periodontal
disease, poor water quality, and dialyzer incompatibility. Obesity also is a
source of cytokines but may be less amenable to treatment. Inflammation is
multifactorial in dialysis patients. Some sources are recognizable and
correctable, such as vascular access type, clinical infection, and water quality,
and some are not. Inflammation is strongly associated with outcome.

Health-related quality of life outcomes in chronic kidney disease.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania 15213, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney
disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated
criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to 
determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were
associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the
association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly
increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for
the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds 
of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation,
vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and
chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney
disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.
Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection
remain elusive.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the Eclat survey was to evaluate the frequency of frailty
in uncontrolled hypertensives and to individualize different frailty profiles.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was an observational, prospective, longitudinal survey
conducted in the cohort of uncontrolled hypertensive patients aged 55 years or
more. Morbid events having occurred between two visits at a 6-month interval were
reported. Patients with at least one event were considered to be frail.
Predictive factors of at least one event were identified (logistic regression).
The analysis was completed by a typological analysis (principal components
analysis and clustering).
RESULTS: At least one event occurred in 211 (9%) of 2306 patients (males 55%,
67+/-9 years old, blood pressure [BP]=160+/-11/93+/-8 mmHg, diabetes 23%):
cardiovascular (1.7%), gerontological (5.5%), onset of diabetes (1.3%), worsening
of renal impact (2%). Three frailty profiles were identified: patients at low
risk (n=1507, event rate=6%), with neither cardiovascular risk factors nor target
organ damage; patients at moderate risk (n=335, event rate=12%) with numerous
risk factors but no target organ damage and patients at high risk (n=243, event
rate=23%), the older ones, in bad general condition, with target organ damage,
sensorial deficits and cognitive disorders. In a population of uncontrolled
hypertensives aged 55 years or more, 9% could be considered as frailty.
CONCLUSION: Therapeutic measures might be adapted according to the frailty
profile of the patient. With respect to treatment management, healthcare
behaviour could differ depending on these frailty profiles.

In many longitudinal clinical studies, the level and progression rate of
repeatedly measured biomarkers on each subject quantify the severity of the
disease and that subject's susceptibility to progression of the disease. It is of
scientific and clinical interest to relate such quantities to a later
time-to-event clinical endpoint such as patient survival. This is usually done
with a shared parameter model. In such models, the longitudinal biomarker data
and the survival outcome of each subject are assumed to be conditionally
independent given subject-level severity or susceptibility (also called frailty
in statistical terms). In this article, we study the case where the conditional
distribution of longitudinal data is modeled by a linear mixed-effect model, and 
the conditional distribution of the survival data is given by a Cox proportional 
hazard model. We allow unknown regression coefficients and time-dependent
covariates in both models. The proposed estimators are maximizers of an exact
correction to the joint log likelihood with the frailties eliminated as nuisance 
parameters, an idea that originated from correction of covariate measurement
error in measurement error models. The corrected joint log likelihood is shown to
be asymptotically concave and leads to consistent and asymptotically normal
estimators. Unlike most published methods for joint modeling, the proposed
estimation procedure does not rely on distributional assumptions of the
frailties. The proposed method was studied in simulations and applied to a data
set from the Hemodialysis Study.

Diabetic foot ulcerations result from different physiopathological mechanisms; a 
clear understanding of them is crucial to reduce their incidence, provide early
care, and finally delay the amputation risk. The three main diabetes
complications involved in foot ulcerations are neuropathy, peripheral arterial
disease, and infection. The most common pathway to ulceration is peripheral
sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy, leading to loss of sensitivity, foot
deformities, high foot pressure, and dry skin. Peripheral arterial disease is
more frequent and more serious in the diabetic population. It delays
cicatrization and causes gangrene and finally amputation. Infection is also a
major complication of ulceration because of its risk of spreading into deep
tissue and bone, which increases the risk of amputation. Infection may also
generalize and become life-threatening. These complications preferentially affect
the foot because it is exposed to hyper pressure, neuropathy, and peripheral
arterial disease, which cause distal lesions, and the foot is exposed to a closed
atmosphere, a source of soaking and skin frailty. Diabetes itself may enhance the
risk of complications stemming from the disease's long-term progression and poor 
glucose control, thereby affecting ocular and renal functions. Finally, some
psychosocial situations such as depression syndrome or poor hygiene possibly
enhance diabetic foot occurrence.

Summary for patients in
    Ann Intern Med. 2008 Aug 19;149(4):I42.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) vitamin D]
concentration and hip fractures is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To see whether low serum 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations are
associated with hip fractures in community-dwelling women.
DESIGN: Nested case-control study.
SETTING: 40 clinical centers in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: 400 case-patients with incident hip fracture and 400 control
participants matched on the basis of age, race or ethnicity, and date of blood
draw. Both groups were selected from 39 795 postmenopausal women who were not
using estrogens or other bone-active therapies and who had not had a previous hip
fracture.
MEASUREMENTS: Serum 25(OH) vitamin D was measured and patients were followed for 
a median of 7.1 years (range, 0.7 to 9.3 years) to assess fractures.
RESULTS: Mean serum 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations were lower in case-patients
than in control participants (55.95 nmol/L [SD, 20.28] vs. 59.60 nmol/L [SD,
18.05]; P = 0.007), and lower serum 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations increased hip
fracture risk (adjusted odds ratio for each 25-nmol/L decrease, 1.33 [95% CI,
1.06 to 1.68]). Women with the lowest 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations (< or =47.5
nmol/L) had a higher fracture risk than did those with the highest concentrations
(> or =70.7 nmol/L) (adjusted odds ratio, 1.71 [CI, 1.05 to 2.79]), and the risk 
increased statistically significantly across quartiles of serum 25(OH) vitamin D 
concentration (P for trend = 0.016). This association was independent of number
of falls, physical function, frailty, renal function, and sex-steroid hormone
levels and seemed to be partially mediated by bone resorption.
LIMITATIONS: Few case-patients were nonwhite women. Bone mineral density and
parathyroid hormone levels were not accounted for in the analysis.
CONCLUSION: Low serum 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations are associated with a
higher risk for hip fracture.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between markers of vitamins B12, B6 and
folate deficiency and the geriatric syndrome of frailty.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of baseline measures from the combined Women's
Health and Aging Studies.
SETTING: Baltimore, Maryland.
PARTICIPANTS: Seven hundred three community-dwelling women, aged 70-79.
MEASUREMENTS: Frailty was defined by five-component screening criteria that
include weight, grip strength, endurance, physical activity and walking speed
measurements and modeled as binary and 3-level polytomous outcomes. Independent
variables serum vitamin B6, vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid, total homocysteine, 
cystathionine and folate were modeled continuously and as abnormal versus normal.
RESULTS: Serum biomarker levels varied significantly by race. All analyses were
race-stratified and results are reported only for Caucasian women due to small
African American sample size. In polytomous logistic regression models of 3-level
frailty, Caucasian women with increasing MMA, defined either continuously or
using a predefined threshold, had 40-60% greater odds of being prefrail (p-values
< 0.07) and 1.66-2.33 times greater odds of being frail (p-values < 0.02)
compared to nonfrails after adjustment for age, education, low serum carotenoids,
alcohol intake, cardiovascular disease and renal impairment. Both binary and
polytomous frailty models evaluating vitamin B12 as the main exposure estimated
odds ratios that were similar in trend yet slightly less significant than the MMA
results.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that vitamin B12 deficiency may contribute to 
the frailty syndrome in community-dwelling older women. Future studies are needed
to explore these relationships longitudinally.

Patients with heart failure (HF) are at increased risk for frailty, and
identification is challenging. The authors assessed the distance on the 6-minute 
walk test (6MWT) as a measure of frailty in 60 older HF patients (ejection
fraction <or= 40%) compared with frailty phenotype (FP). Scores were dichotomized
to frail (F) or nonfrail (NF), and the results of 6MWT were dichotomized to low
endurance (LE) or normal endurance (NE). FP and 6MWT results were in moderate
agreement (kappa=0.57, confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.79; age-adjusted
kappa=0.54, 95% CI, 0.33-0.76);25% of participants were classified as F/LE, and
55% were classified as NF/NE. Discordance was asymmetric (McNemar P=.006); 18% of
participants were NF/LE. There were no differences between the NF/LE and other
groups in age, sex, body mass index, or physical activity level. Results in the
NF/LE group differed from those in the NF/NE group by a slower 8-foot walking
speed (P=.02), weaker grip strength (P=.056), and worse renal function (P=.01)
and from those in the F/LE group by faster 8-foot walking speed (P<.001). The
6MWT may be useful to identify frailty and those in transition to frailty.

Anemia signifies an underlying disease and is associated with poor clinical
outcomes. In elderly patients, in whom anemia has a high prevalence (greater than
10 percent), neither the hemoglobin threshold for concern nor the identity of the
anemia-causing disease is easily established. This is an important shortfall,
because even mild anemia can compromise patient well-being and survival,
regardless of the underlying cause. This review discusses definitions of "normal"
hemoglobin levels in adults, common causes of anemia in people aged 65 years and 
older (eg, nutritional deficiency, renal insufficiency, inflammatory disorders,
and myelodysplastic syndrome), and potential consequences of anemia in elderly
patients (eg, poorer cognitive status, increased frailty, and an elevated risk of
hospitalization and of complications during hospitalization). We also outline a
practical initial diagnostic approach that helps determine appropriate treatment,
and we weigh therapeutic options in light of new safety concerns regarding
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

New advances in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) change the
perspective from which many of its features and treatment are viewed. Calcium,
phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D have been shown to be
important determinants of survival associated with kidney diseases. Now ROD
dependent and independent of these factors is linked to survival more than just
skeletal frailty. This review focuses on recent discoveries that renal injury
impairs skeletal anabolism decreasing the osteoblast compartment of the skeleton 
and consequent bone formation. This discovery and the discovery that PTH
regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche alters our view of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) from that of a disease to
that of a necessary adaptation to renal injury that goes awry. Furthermore, ROD
is shown to be an underappreciated factor in the level of the serum phosphorus in
CKD. The discovery and the elucidation of the mechanism of hyperphosphatemia as a
cardiovascular risk in CKD change the view of ROD. It is now recognized as more
than a skeletal disorder, it is an important component of the mortality of CKD
that can be treated.

Care, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of seniors are starting renal replacement therapy.
Many may experience a loss of functional independence including mobility
impairment. Seniors on dialysis commonly have multiple comorbidities that are
associated with an increased risk for falls in the general population. Falls lead
to serious injury, loss of independence, hospitalization and
institutionalization. Despite such morbidity, little attention has been directed 
toward this marker of frailty in the dialysis population. In this brief
preliminary report, we set out to determine the prevalence of falls among seniors
on dialysis.
METHODS: A cross-sectional interview based survey was used to determine one year 
fall prevalence in patients aged 65 years and older receiving in center
hemodialysis therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 135 ambulatory seniors were interviewed. Thirty-seven (27%)
people reported having fallen in the past 12 months. An additional 21(16%)
reported a fall prior to the past year. Four percent recalled a fall associated
fracture or head injury requiring treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Falls are very common amongst seniors on hemodialysis. Further
prospective study of the incidence and risk factors for falls in this population 
is needed to allow targeted interventions.

BACKGROUND: Anemia is viewed as a negative prognostic factor in the elderly
population; its independent impact on survival is unclear.
METHODS: Baseline hemoglobin quintiles and anemia, as defined by the World Health
Organization criteria, were assessed in relation to mortality in the
Cardiovascular Health Study, a prospective cohort study with 11.2 years of
follow-up of 5888 community-dwelling men and women 65 years or older, enrolled in
1989-1990 or 1992-1993 in 4 US communities.
RESULTS: A total of 1205 participants were in the lowest hemoglobin quintile
(<13.7 g/dL for men; <12.6 g/dL for women), and 498 (8.5%) were anemic (<13 g/dL 
for men; <12 g/dL for women). A reverse J-shaped relationship with mortality was 
observed; age-, sex-, and race-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval
[CI]) in the first and fifth quintiles, compared with the fourth quintile, were
1.42 (95% CI, 1.25-1.62) and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.09-1.42). After multivariate
adjustment, these hazard ratios were 1.33 (95% CI, 1.15-1.54) and 1.17 (95% CI,
1.01-1.36). The demographic- and fully-adjusted hazard ratios of anemia for
mortality were 1.57 (95% CI, 1.38-1.78) and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.19-1.54). Adjustment 
for causes and consequences of anemia (renal function, inflammation, or frailty) 
did not reduce associations.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower and higher hemoglobin concentrations and anemia by World
Health Organization criteria were independently associated with increased
mortality. The World Health Organization criteria did not identify risk as well
as a lower hemoglobin value. Additional study is needed on the clinically valid
definition for and causes of anemia in the elderly and on the increased mortality
at the extremes of hemoglobin concentrations.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of functional disability in the
elderly. Pain and loss of motion induce a vicious circle, leading to instability,
frailty and ultimately invalidity. Currently, there is no treatment to reverse or
slow the disease progression to a clinically meaningful extent. Thus, the primary
goal of OA treatment in the elderly is pain relief and preservation of joint
function. For this, pharmacological, non-pharmacological and if necessary
surgical treatment regimes must form an integrated concept. However, the real
challenge is polymorbidity and other age-related or age-associated factors, which
influence the course of disease and its therapy unfavorably. The changes in
pharmacokinetics and -dynamics in the elderly can be compensated for the
nonopioid and opioid-analgesics by the well known "start low, go slow" approach. 
More problematic are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are
most often used for symptomatic treatment of OA: Patients over 65 have an
enhanced susceptibility to the gastrointestinal and renal side effects of NSAIDs;
all NSAIDs, not only coxibs, increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with
such a disease; number and severity of drug interactions is elevated due to
age-associated polypharmacy. Thus, NSAIDs, including coxibs, should be used with 
great caution for treatment of OA in the elderly.

BACKGROUND: Physiologic changes and disease-related alterations in organ function
occur with aging. These changes can affect drug pharmacokinetics in older
persons.
OBJECTIVE: This article reviews age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and their
clinical relevance.
METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted using the terms elderly and
pharmacokinetics. Other reviews were also included for literature searching. The 
review includes literature in particular from 1990 through April 2004. Some
articles from before 1990 were included to help illustrate principles of
age-related pharmacokinetics.
RESULTS: There are minor changes in drug absorption with aging. The effect of
aging on small-bowel transporter systems is not yet fully established.
Bioavailability of highly extracted drugs often is increased with age.
Transdermal absorption may be delayed, especially in the case of water-soluble
compounds. Fat-soluble drugs may distribute more widely and water-soluble drugs
less extensively in older persons. Hepatic drug metabolism shows wide
interindividual variation, and in many cases, there is an age-related decline in 
elimination of metabolized drugs, particularly those eliminated by the cytochrome
enzyme system. Any decrement in cytochrome enzyme metabolism appears
nonselective. Synthetic conjugation metabolism is less affected by age.
Pseudocapillarization of the sinusoidal endothelium in the liver, restricting
oxygen diffusion, and the decline in liver size and liver blood flow may
influence age-related changes in rate of hepatic metabolism. Frailty,
physiological stress, and illness are important predictors of drug metabolism in 
older individuals. Inhibition of drug metabolism is not altered with aging, but
induction is reduced in a minority of studies. Renal drug elimination typically
declines with age, commensurate with the fall in creatinine clearance. Renal
tubular organic acid transport may decline with age, while the function of the
organic base transporter is preserved but may be less responsive to stimulation.
CONCLUSION: Changes in pharmacokinetics occur due to age-related physiologic
perturbations. These changes contribute to altered dose requirements in older
persons, particularly in the case of drugs eliminated by the kidney.
Interindividual variation, disease, frailty, and stress may overshadow
age-related changes.

Many patients with high blood pressure receive multiple medications for
hypertension and other conditions, placing them at risk for adverse drug
interactions. Additionally, as the prevalence of hypertension increases with age,
factors like greater frailty, comorbidity of the elderly requiring polypharmacy, 
and reduced hepatic and renal clearance rates for the elimination of drugs
increase the likelihood of drug interactions. Angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) are the most recent class of agents for the treatment of hypertension. Due
to a favourable side effect profile, this class of drugs deserves increased
attention. This article reviews drug interactions of ARBs and suggests measures
for reducing the risk of adverse events when drugs are co-administered. MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, Cochrane library, and CINAHL were searched. Reported and likely clinical 
relevant interactions of ARBs with concomitantly given drugs are summarised in
Table 2 and 3. Compared to other classes of antihypertensive agents, the ARBs
appear to have a low potential for drug interactions; however, interactions with 
this class occur and variations within the class have been detected, mainly due
to different affinities for cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.

A new category of patients aged >75 yrs, namely the elderly, is now being freely 
admitted to hemodialysis (HD) and this category is becoming predominant. The
absence of systematic studies makes this patient category almost
indistinguishable from other categories, even though its peculiarity is now
evident. At least 30-40% of individuals in this age bracket are expected to be
dependent and/or frail, but the incidence of frailty is likely to be higher in
the elderly undergoing HD. Due to severe physical and/or mental impairment and
often because of strong social hardships, these patients rarely experience
clinical stability and are dependent on third parties for their survival. Their
care produces complex problems for welfare services and this has proved
responsible for modifying the organization of renal care units. These repeated
patient admissions to hospital are filling nephrology facilities, and the
dialysis management -- mainly concerning outpatients -- requires a much greater
use of facilities and staff than normal if compared to average dialysis patients.
In 112 elderly patients consecutively admitted to the dialysis program over a
period of 10 yrs, we identified 35 dependent or frail patients (31.2%), even
taking into consideration only extreme degrees of infirmity. Dependence proved to
be the only clinical parameter associated with survival (mortality at 6 months
23.6 vs. 10.6%, p<0.01; Kaplan-Meier survival curves, p<0.03 log-rank test),
while comorbidities -- in particular cardiovascular -- that usually affect
dialysis mortality rates, did not seem to be discriminating risk factors in the
elderly. More precisely, with the confirmation of these data through wider case
studies, the idea will be reinforced that, also in dialysis, the elderly must be 
constantly monitored for dependence and frailty, as is the case in any
exclusively geriatric field. Prevention, as well as a therapeutic approach
specifically modeled on these conditions, could help to improve the prognosis of 
this patient category, which is particularly difficult to deal with and is
becoming predominant in dialysis units.

USA. xueling@umich.edu

To account for the correlation between failure and censoring, we propose a new
frailty model for clustered data. In this model, the risk to be censored is
affected by the risk of failure. This model allows flexibility in the direction
and degree of dependence between failure and censoring. It includes the
traditional frailty model as a special case. It allows censoring by some causes
to be analyzed as informative while treating censoring by other causes as
noninformative. It can also analyze data for competing risks. To fit the model,
the EM algorithm is used with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations in the
E-steps. Simulation studies and analysis of data for kidney disease patients are 
provided. Consequences of incorrectly assuming noninformative censoring are
investigated.

The use of frailty models in genetic studies: application to the relationship
between end-stage renal failure and mutation type in Alport syndrome. European

BACKGROUND: Alport syndrome (AS) is a severe hereditary disease usually
transmitted as an X dominant trait and involving a mutation of the COL4A5 gene.
It leads to end-stage renal failure (ESRF), but this progression is
heterogeneous. Mutations of the COL4A5 gene have been characterised in numerous
families using molecular biology. Our objective was to evaluate the interfamilial
heterogeneity of the disease and to study relationships between mutation types
and progression to ESRF in the European Community Alport Syndrome Concerted
Action group (ECASCA) registry database.
METHODS: We used the frailty model framework. Frailty models have been developed 
to analyse censored data with non-independent observations. Random effects are
introduced in a Cox proportional regression model to take into account the
intracluster correlations. In this study, ESRF is considered a censored event and
the intrafamilial correlations are taken into account in the frailty models.
RESULTS: These approaches allow us to demonstrate the existence of an
interfamilial heterogeneity; the role of the mutation type explains the
interfamilial variability. In particular, the results suggest that some mutation 
types are associated with a higher risk of ESRF for males.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of characterising the mutation at
the molecular level in genetic studies, to understand the relationship between
genotype and phenotype. The frailty models constitute an attractive approach in
this context, when the phenotype is characterised by a censored end-point.

BACKGROUND: Statistical analysis for correlated censored data allows to study
censored events in clustered structure designs. Considering a possible
correlation among failure times of the same group, standard methodology is no
longer applicable. We investigated proposed models in this context to study
familial data about a genetic disease, Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome is a
severe hereditary disease due to abnormal collagenous chains. Renal failure is
the main symptom of the disease. It progresses toward end-stage renal failure
(IRT) according to a high time variability. As shown by genetic studies,
mutations of COL4A5 gene are involved in the X-linked Alport Syndrome. Due to the
large range of the mutation types, the aim of this study was to search for a
possible genetic origin of the heterogeneity of the disease severity.
METHODS: Marginal survival models and mixed effects survival models (so-called
frailty models) were proposed to take into account the possible non independence 
of the observations. In this study, time until end-stage renal failure is a
rightly censored end point. Possible intra-familial correlations due to shared
environmental and/or genetic factors could induce dependence among familial
failure times. In this paper, we fit marginal and frailty proportional hazards
models to evaluate the effect of mutation type on the risk of IRT and an
interfamilial heterogeneity of failure times.
RESULTS: In this study, the use of these models allows to show the presence of an
interfamilial heterogeneity of the failure times to IRT. Moreover, the results
suggest that some mutation types are linked to a higher risk of fast evolution to
IRT, which explains partially the interfamilial heterogeneity of the failure
times.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows the interest of marginal and frailty models to
evaluate the heterogeneity of censored responses and to study relationships
between a censored criterion and covariables. This study puts forward the
importance of characterizing the mutation at a molecular level to understand the 
relationship between genotype and phenotype.

Survival differences among older dialysis patients in the southeast.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta,
GA.

Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic dialysis have
higher mortality in the United States than in many other countries. While
increasing age, white race, male sex, and/or diabetes are considered risk factors
for survival, few studies of older dialysis patients have simultaneously
considered multiple predictor variables and their interactions. Using information
contained in the 1982 to 1986 ESRD Network 20 database for Georgia and South
Carolina, we studied hospitalizations and survival of 1,354 blacks and 965 whites
who were age 60 years or older when they began dialysis therapy. Survival time
was modeled using the Cox life-table regression method. Older blacks' median age 
at dialysis initiation was 67.4, compared with 68.7 for older whites (P = 0.001).
Blacks were more likely than whites (P < 0.001) to have hypertension-related or
diabetes-related ESRD. White patients experienced approximately 25% more
hospitalization when adjustment was made for patient-days at risk. Separate
multivariate survival models were required for patients with diabetes-related
versus non-diabetes-related ESRD. Among diabetics, mortality was higher among
whites and among patients who were older when they began dialysis. Among patients
with non-diabetes-related ESRD, mortality was higher among patients who were
older when they began dialysis, but the age effect was much stronger for white
males. Our hospitalization and mortality data support the view that unmeasured
severity (or frailty) differences characterize white as compared with black
dialysis patients. Among non-diabetes-related ESRD patients, the age effect on
survival was more severe in white males than in blacks or in white females. The
high mortality we observed among older dialysis patients in Georgia and South
Carolina warrants further study; the data may in part reflect patients' lower
socioeconomic status compared with age, race, and sex-matched controls.

Regression with frailty in survival analysis.

In studies of survival, the hazard function for each individual may depend on
observed risk variables but usually not all such variables are known or
measurable. This unknown factor of the hazard function is usually termed the
individual heterogeneity or frailty. When survival is time to the occurrence of a
particular type of event and more than one such time may be obtained for each
individual, frailty is a common factor among such recurrence times. A model
including frailty is fitted to such repeated measures of recurrence times.

[Development of "mixed connective tissue disease" (MCTD) from discoid lupus
erythematosus].

[Article in German]

Bauer R, Schultz-Ehrenburg U, Orfanos CE.

A patient with discoid lupus erythematosus is reported which turned into a mixed 
connective tissue disease (MCTD) within five months. THe patient developed a
severe polysymptomatic clinical picture with frailty, myositis, generalized
erythema and livedo racemosa features, but without renal involvement. Combined
therapy with prednisolone and azathioprine led to rapid regression of all
symptoms. After releasing from the hospital a mitigated relapse could be
controlled by increasing the dose of cortico-steroids. No other relapse occurred 
during the following year. Since the onset of disease the indirect
immunofluorescence showed antinuclear antibodies of the speckled pattern. Also we
could mark antibodies against ENA. We regard this finding as an indication, that 
in patients with discoid lupus erythematosus and antinuclear antibodies of the
speckled pattern the risk of progressing into MCTD had to be considered. Repeated
controls for symptoms of other collagenoses, therefore, should follow for a
period of two years.
