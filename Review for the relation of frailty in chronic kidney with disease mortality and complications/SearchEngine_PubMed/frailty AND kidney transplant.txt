BACKGROUND: Frail kidney transplant (KT) recipients have higher risk of adverse
post-KT outcomes. Yet, there is interest in measuring frailty at KT evaluation
and then using this information for post-KT risk stratification. Given long wait 
times for KT, frailty may improve or worsen between evaluation and KT. Patterns, 
predictors, and post-KT adverse outcomes associated with these changes are
unclear.
METHODS: 569 adult KT candidates were enrolled in a cohort study of frailty
(11/2009-09/2017) at evaluation and followed-up at KT. Patterns of frailty
transitions were categorized as: 1) binary state change (frail/nonfrail); 2)
3-category state change (frail/intermediate/nonfrail); and 3) raw score change
(-5 to 5). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models were
used to test whether patterns of frailty transitions were associated with adverse
post-KT outcomes.
RESULTS: Between evaluation and KT, 22.0% became more frail, while 24.4% became
less frail. Black race (RRR=1.98, 95%CI:1.07-3.67) was associated with
frail-to-nonfrail transition; diabetes (RRR=2.56, 95%CI:1.22-5.39) was associated
with remaining stably frail. Candidates who became more frail between 3-category 
states (HR=2.27, 95%CI:1.11-4.65) or frailty scores (HR=2.36, 95%CI:1.12-4.99)
had increased risk of post-KT mortality and had higher odds of length of stay
(LOS) ≥2 weeks (3-category: OR=2.02, 95%CI:1.20-3.40; scores: OR=1.92,
95%CI:1.13-3.25).
CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of KT candidates experienced change in frailty between
evaluation and KT, and those transitions were associated with mortality and
longer LOS. Monitoring changes in frailty from evaluation to admission may
improve post-KT risk stratification.

BACKGROUND: Restoration of kidney function after kidney transplant generally
improves cognitive function. It is unclear whether frail recipients, with higher 
susceptibility to surgical stressors, achieve such post-transplant cognitive
improvements or whether they experience subsequent cognitive decline as they age 
with a functioning graft.
METHODS: In this two-center cohort study, we assessed pretransplant frailty
(Fried physical frailty phenotype) and cognitive function (Modified Mini-Mental
State Examination) in adult kidney transplant recipients. To investigate
potential short- and medium-term effects of frailty on post-transplant cognitive 
trajectories, we measured cognitive function up to 4 years post-transplant. Using
an adjusted mixed effects model with a random slope (time) and intercept
(person), we characterized post-transplant cognitive trajectories by
pretransplant frailty, accounting for nonlinear trajectories.
RESULTS: Of 665 recipients (mean age 52.0 years) followed for a median of 1.5
years, 15.0% were frail. After adjustment, pretransplant cognitive scores were
significantly lower among frail patients compared with nonfrail patients (89.0
versus 90.8 points). By 3 months post-transplant, cognitive performance improved 
for both frail (slope =0.22 points per week) and nonfrail (slope =0.14 points per
week) recipients. Between 1 and 4 years post-transplant, improvements plateaued
among nonfrail recipients (slope =0.005 points per week), whereas cognitive
function declined among frail recipients (slope =-0.04 points per week). At 4
years post-transplant, cognitive scores were 5.8 points lower for frail
recipients compared with nonfrail recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: On average, both frail and nonfrail recipients experience short-term
cognitive improvement post-transplant. However, frailty is associated with
medium-term cognitive decline post-transplant. Interventions to prevent cognitive
decline among frail recipients should be identified.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) candidates often present with multiple
comorbidities. These patients also have a substantial burden of frailty, which is
also associated with increased mortality. However, it is unknown if frailty is
merely a surrogate for comorbidity, itself an independent domain of risk, or if
frailty and comorbidity have differential effects. Better understanding the
interplay between these 2 constructs will improve clinical decision making in KT 
candidates.
OBJECTIVE: To test whether comorbidity is equally associated with waitlist
mortality among frail and nonfrail KT candidates and to test whether measuring
both comorbidity burden and frailty improves mortality risk prediction.
METHODS: We studied 2,086 candidates on the KT waitlist (November 2009 - October 
2017) in a multicenter cohort study, in whom frailty and comorbidity were
measured at evaluation. We quantified the association between Charlson
comorbidity index (CCI) adapted for end-stage renal disease and waitlist
mortality using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model and tested whether
this association differed between frail and nonfrail candidates.
RESULTS: At evaluation, 18.1% of KT candidates were frail and 51% had a high
comorbidity burden (CCI score ≥2). Candidates with a high comorbidity burden were
at 1.38-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.89) increased risk of waitlist mortality. However,
this association differed by frailty status (p for interaction = 0.01): among
nonfrail candidates, a high comorbidity burden was associated with a 1.66-fold
(95% CI 1.17-2.35) increased mortality risk; among frail candidates, here was no 
statistically significant association (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.44-1.29). Adding this
interaction between comorbidity and frailty to a mortality risk estimation model 
significantly improved prediction, increasing the c-statistic from 0.640 to 0.656
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Nonfrail candidates with a high comorbidity burden at KT evaluation 
have an increased risk of waitlist mortality. Importantly, comorbidity is less of
a concern in already high-risk patients who are frail.

Center-specific survival outcomes of kidney transplant recipients are an
important quality measure, with several challenges. Existing methods based on
restricted mean lifetime tend to focus on short- and medium-term clinical
outcomes and may fail to capture long-term effects associated with quality of
follow-up care. In this report, we propose methods that combine a lognormal
frailty model and piecewise exponential baseline rates to compare the mean
survival time across centers. The proposed methods allow for the consistent
estimation of mean survival time as opposed to restricted mean lifetime and,
within this context, permits more accurate profiling of long-term center-specific
outcomes. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are derived, and
finite-sample properties are examined through simulation. The proposed methods
are then applied to national kidney transplant data. The novelty of the proposed 
techniques arises from several angles. We utilize mean survival, in contrast to
the most previous works that considered the restricted mean. Few previous studies
have used the integrated survival function as a basis for center effects. Few
provider profiling methods use a random effects model to estimate fixed center
effects.

Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is rare and characterized endoscopically by
distal esophageal ulceration, blackening, and necrosis. It typically arises in
patients with multiple comorbidities who have significant systemic disease and
frailty. Specific precipitating events are variable. Evidence suggests a
multifactorial etiology likely involving esophageal ischemia in the setting of
corrosive injury from gastric contents and impaired tissue repair mechanisms. In 
the transplant setting, immunosuppression likely plays a substantial role. We
report a case of AEN in a 70-year-old man following a renal transplant.

This study investigated geographical variations of access to renal
transplantation using three outcomes (access to the transplant waiting list,
access to renal transplantation after waitlisting and access to renal
transplantation after dialysis start). Associations of patient-related and
regional variables with the studied outcomes were assessed using a Cox shared
frailty model and a Fine and Gray model. At the study endpoint (December 31,
2015), 26.3% of all 18-90-year-old patients who started dialysis in the 22
mainland and four overseas French regions in 2012 (n = 9312) were waitlisted and 
15.1% received a kidney transplant. The geographical disparities of access to
renal transplantation varied according to the studied outcome. Patients from the 
Ile-de-France region had the highest probability of being waitlisted, but were
less likely to receive a kidney transplant. Two regional factors were associated 
with the access to the waiting list and to renal transplantation from dialysis
start: the incidence of preemptive kidney transplantation and of ESRD. The use of
different outcomes to evaluate access to kidney transplantation could help
healthcare policy-makers to select the most appropriate interventions for each
region in order to reduce treatment disparities.

BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated the Timed Up and Go Test's (TUGT) ability
to forecast postoperative outcomes for several surgical specialties. Evaluations 
of the TUGT for waitlist and posttransplant outcomes have yet to be examined in
kidney transplantation.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic utility of the TUGT and its associations with
waitlist and posttransplant outcomes for kidney transplant candidates.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Single-center, prospective study of 518 patients who
performed TUGT during their transplant evaluation between 9/1/2013-11/30/2014.
TUGT times were evaluated as a continuous variable or 3-level discrete
categorical variable with TUGT times categorized as long (>9 seconds), average
(8-9 seconds), or short (5-8 seconds).
RESULTS: Transplanted individuals had shorter TUGT times than those who remained 
on the waitlist (8.99 vs 9.79 seconds, P < 0.001). Bivariable and multivariable
logistic regression showed that after adjusting for age, there was no association
between TUGT times and probability of waitlist removal (OR 0.997 [0.814-1.221]), 
prolonged length of stay posttransplant (OR 1.113 [0.958-1.306] for deceased
donor, OR 0.983 [0.757-1.277] for living donor), and 30-day readmissions (OR
0.984 [0.845-1.146] for deceased donor, OR 1.254 [0.976-1.613] for living donor).
CONCLUSIONS: The TUGT was not associated with waitlist removal or prolonged
hospitalization for kidney transplant candidates. Alternative assessments of
global health, such as functional status or frailty, should be considered for
evaluation of potential kidney transplant candidates.

BACKGROUND: Up to 31% of kidney transplant (KT) recipients experience early
hospital readmission (EHR). We hypothesized that EHR among older KT recipients is
higher than younger recipients due to increased comorbidities and higher
prevalence of frailty.
METHODS: We identified 22,458 older (age ≥65) and 86,372 younger (18 to < 65)
first-time KT recipients (December 1, 1999 - December 31, 2014) using United
States Renal Data System data. We estimated the association between patient-level
characteristics and EHR (30 days post-KT discharge) with modified Poisson
regression among older and younger KT recipients, separately. We estimated the
association between graft loss and mortality and EHR using Cox proportional
hazards.
RESULTS: EHR was more common in older KT recipients (30.1 vs. 27.6%; p < 0.001). 
Risk factors for EHR that differed by recipient age included female sex, African 
American race, diabetes, smoking, dialysis vintage, donor age, and length of
stay. Risk of graft loss associated with EHR was greater among older KT
recipients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.64, 95% CI 1.51-1.77, p < 0.001) than
younger KT recipients (aHR 1.43, 95% CI 1.38-1.48, p < 0.001; interaction p <
0.01). However, the risk of mortality associated with EHR was greater among
younger recipients (aHR 1.52, 95% CI 1.47-1.57, p < 0.001) than that in older
-recipients (aHR 1.40, 95% CI 1.34-1.47, p < 0.001; interaction p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Older KT recipients are more likely to experience EHR and are at a
higher risk of graft loss after EHR than younger recipients. Targeted
interventions to prevent EHR and subsequent graft loss in this population should 
be identified.

Kidney transplant wait-list management is becoming increasingly complex. We
introduced a novel wait-list management strategy at our center, the Transplant
Readiness Assessment Clinic (TRAC), whereby patients whose Kidney Allocation
Scores surpass a threshold are actively managed. From January 1, 2016 through
June 30, 2017, we evaluated 195 patients through TRAC. Compared to pre-TRAC
systems at our institution, TRAC resulted in a higher proportion of activation at
18 months (38% vs 22%-26%, P < 0.0001), despite being enriched in patients with
long dialysis duration. TRAC also resulted in a higher proportion of wait-list
removal (15% vs 8%-9%, P < 0.05) although combined wait-list removal and death on
wait-list did not differ (18% vs 16%-17%). Median time to activation was 356 days
from TRAC evaluation. Of the transplant barriers, need for cardiovascular studies
was the most common (31%), followed by other medical issues (23%), poor
functional status (13%), and psychosocial issues (10%). By concentrating center
resources on patients most likely to be transplanted after activation and
performing active patient management close to the time of transplant, TRAC has
the potential to significantly enhance kidney transplant success in regions with 
long wait-times.

Depressive symptoms and frailty are each independently associated with morbidity 
and mortality in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. We hypothesized that having
both depressive symptoms and frailty would be synergistic and worse than the
independent effect of each. In a multicenter cohort study of 773 KT recipients,
we measured the Fried frailty phenotype and the modified 18-question Center for
Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Using adjusted Poisson regression
and survival analysis, we tested whether depressive symptoms (CES-D score > 14)
and frailty were associated with KT length of stay (LOS), death-censored graft
failure (DCGF), and mortality. At KT admission, 10.0% of patients exhibited
depressive symptoms, 16.3% were frail, and 3.6% had both. Recipients with
depressive symptoms were more likely to be frail (aOR = 3.97, 95% CI: 2.28-6.91, 
P < 0.001). Recipients with both depressive symptoms and frailty had a 1.88 times
(95% CI: 1.70-2.08, P < 0.001) longer LOS, 6.20-fold (95% CI:1.67-22.95,
P < 0.01) increased risk of DCGF, and 2.62-fold (95% CI:1.03-6.70,
P = 0.04) increased risk of mortality, compared to those who were nonfrail and
without depressive symptoms. There was only evidence of synergistic effect of
frailty and depressive symptoms on length of stay (P for interaction < 0.001).
Interventions aimed at reducing pre-KT depressive symptoms and frailty should be 
explored for their impact on post-KT outcomes.

AIM: The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether
pre-operative hypoalbuminaemia (<35 g/L) is associated with adverse outcomes post
kidney transplantation.
METHODS: Our retrospective, single-centre analysis included all patients who
received their kidney transplant between 2007 and 2017, with documented admission
albumin levels prior to surgery. Survival analyses were undertaken to explore the
relationship of pre-transplant hypoalbuminaemia versus other baseline variables
upon post-transplant outcomes.
RESULTS: We analysed 1,131 kidney allograft recipients transplanted at our center
(2007-2017), with median follow up 746 days (IQR 133-1,750 days). Kidney
transplant recipients with pre-operative hypoalbuminaemia were more likely older,
female, recipients of deceased-donor kidneys and to have longer cold ischaemic
times. Recipients with pre-operative hypoalbuminaemia had longer hospital
admissions post-operatively but no difference in delayed graft function rates.
There was no difference in 1-year creatinine but recipients with hypoalbuminaemia
had reduced risk for cellular rejection. We observed significantly worse patient 
survival (83.2% versus 90.7%, p<0.001) and overall graft survival (72.5% versus
82.0%, p<0.001) for recipients with hypoalbuminaemia versus normal albumin levels
respectively but no difference in death-censored graft survival. In a Cox
regression model, adjusted for baseline pre-operative variables, hypoalbuminaemia
was independently associated with an increased risk for overall graft loss after 
kidney transplantation (hazard ratio 1.468, 95% CI 1.087-1.982, p=0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative hypoalbuminaemia is an independent risk factor for
overall graft loss after kidney transplantation. Further work is warranted to
investigate the underlying pathophysiology to determine what supportive measures 
can be undertaken to attenuate adverse post-transplant outcomes. This article is

More than one-third of US adults have limited health literacy, putting them at
risk of adverse clinical outcomes. We evaluated the prevalence of limited health 
literacy among 1578 adult kidney transplant (KT) candidates (May 2014-November
2017) and examined its association with listing for transplant and waitlist
mortality in this pilot study. Limited health literacy was assessed at KT
evaluation by using a standard cutoff score ≤5 on the Brief Health Literacy
Screen (score range 0-12, lower scores indicate worse health literacy). We used
logistic regression and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to identify risk
factors for limited health literacy and to quantify its association with listing 
and waitlist mortality. We found that 8.9% of candidates had limited health
literacy; risk factors included less than college education (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR] = 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.86-4.43), frailty (aOR = 1.85, 95%
CI:1.22-2.80), comorbidity (Charlson comorbidity index [1-point increase]
aOR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.20), and cognitive impairment (aOR = 3.45, 95% CI:
2.20-5.41) after adjusting for age, sex, race, and income. Candidates with
limited health literacy had a 30% (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% CI:
0.54-0.91) decreased likelihood of listing and a 2.42-fold (95% CI: 1.16- to
5.05-fold) increased risk of waitlist mortality. Limited health literacy may be a
salient mechanism in access to KT; programs to aid candidates with limited health
literacy may improve outcomes and reduce disparities.

Background Frail kidney transplant (KT) recipients may be particularly vulnerable
to surgical stressors, resulting in delirium and subsequent adverse outcomes. We 
sought to identify the incidence, risk factors, and sequelae of post-KT
delirium.Methods We studied 125,304 adult KT recipients (1999-2014) to estimate
delirium incidence in national registry claims. Additionally, we used a validated
chart abstraction algorithm to identify post-KT delirium in 893 adult recipients 
(2009-2017) from a cohort study of frailty. Delirium sequelae were identified
using adjusted logistic regression (length of stay ≥2 weeks and institutional
discharge [skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility]) and adjusted Cox
regression (death-censored graft loss and mortality).Results Only 0.8% of KT
recipients had a delirium claim. In the cohort study, delirium incidence
increased with age (18-49 years old: 2.0%; 50-64 years old: 4.6%; 65-75 years
old: 9.2%; and ≥75 years old: 13.8%) and frailty (9.0% versus 3.9%); 20.0% of
frail recipients aged ≥75 years old experienced delirium. Frailty was
independently associated with delirium (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 4.13; P=0.04), but premorbid global cognitive function
was not. Recipients with delirium had increased risks of ≥2-week length of stay
(OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 2.76 to 10.66; P<0.001), institutional discharge (OR, 22.41;
95% CI, 7.85 to 63.98; P<0.001), graft loss (hazard ratio [HR], 2.73; 95% CI,
1.14 to 6.53; P=0.03), and mortality (HR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.76 to 5.54;
P<0.001).Conclusions Post-KT delirium is a strong risk factor for subsequent
adverse outcomes, yet it is a clinical entity that is often missed.

BACKGROUND: Among community-dwelling older adults, frailty is associated with
heightened markers of inflammation and subsequent mortality. Although frailty is 
common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, the role of frailty and
markers of inflammation in this population remains unclear. We quantified these
associations in patients on the kidney transplant waitlist and tested whether
frailty and/or markers of inflammation improve waitlist mortality risk
prediction.
METHODS: We studied 1975 ESRD patients on the kidney transplant waitlist
(November 1, 2009, to February 28, 2017) in a multi-center cohort study of
frailty. Serum inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 [IL-6], soluble tumor necrosis
factor-α receptor-1 [sTNFR1], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were analyzed in 605 
of these participants; we calculated the inflammatory index score using IL-6 and 
sTNFR1. We compared the C-statistic of an established registry-based prediction
model for waitlist mortality adding frailty and/or inflammatory markers (1 SD
change in log IL-6, sTNFR1, CRP, or inflammatory index).
RESULTS: The registry-based model had moderate predictive ability (c-statistic = 
0.655). Frailty was associated with increased mortality (2.19; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.26-3.79) but did not improve risk prediction (c-statistic =
0.646; P = 0.65). Like frailty, IL-6 (2.13; 95% CI, 1.41-3.22), sTNFR1 (1.70; 95%
CI, 1.12-2.59), CRP (1.68; 95% CI, 1.06-2.67), and the inflammatory index (2.09; 
95% CI, 1.38-3.16) were associated with increased mortality risk; unlike frailty,
adding IL-6 (c-statistic = 0.777; P = 0.02), CRP (c-statistic = 0.728; P = 0.02),
or inflammatory index (c-statistic = 0.777; P = 0.02) substantially improved
mortality risk prediction.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty and markers of inflammation were associated with increased
waitlist mortality risk, but only markers of inflammation significantly improved 
ESRD risk prediction. These findings help clarify the accelerated aging
physiology of ESRD and highlight easy-to-measure markers of increased waitlist
mortality risk.

Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after
transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for
nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period
are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa …), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or
Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical
antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and
bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation,
pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H.
influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take
advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to 
six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many
years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial
pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of
pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in
diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney
transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with
co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome,
increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common
opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant
recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and 
Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of
immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective
therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy
should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

Background: Frailty can be defined as an inflammatory state with a loss of
physiologic reserve in multiple systems that manifests as a decreased ability to 
respond to stressors that ultimately leads to an increased risk of adverse
outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the ease of frailty testing in a
pre-kidney transplant clinic and the resources required to do so. A secondary
goal was to better understand the utility of frailty testing when evaluating
potential kidney transplant recipients.
Methods: Frailty testing was conducted at a pre-kidney transplant clinic in three
phases using Fried's frailty phenotype (shrinking, exhaustion, low physical
activity, slowness, and grip strength).
Results: A total of 132 frailty tests were completed on 128 patients. Frail
patients had significantly higher rates of shrinking (26% vs. 8.5%, P < 0.05),
exhaustion (82.6% vs. 27.6%, P < 0.05), low physical activity (78.2% vs. 19.0%, P
< 0.05), slow walking (60.8% vs. 15.2%, P < 0.05), and grip strength (73.9% vs.
25.7%, P < 0.05). When comparing the listing of frail and non-frail patients for 
transplant, a significantly lower proportion of frail patients were listed
compared to non-frail patients (30.4% vs. 57.6%, P < 0.05). Frailty testing was
most complete when an examiner dedicated to frailty testing performed the
testing.
Conclusions: Frailty testing is feasible to complete in a pre-transplant clinic
with an appropriate investment in personnel and resources.

BACKGROUND: Although individuals classified as nonresident aliens, including
undocumented immigrants, are entitled to receive emergency dialysis in the United
States regardless of their ability to pay, most states do not provide them with
subsidized care for maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation. We explored
whether nonresident aliens have similar outcomes to US citizens after receiving
kidney transplants covered by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health
insurance program.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adult Medicaid patients in the US Renal Data System
who received their first kidney transplant from 1990 to 2011.
PREDICTOR: Citizenship status, categorized as US citizen, nonresident alien, or
permanent resident.
OUTCOME: All-cause transplant loss.
MEASUREMENTS: HRs and 95% CIs estimated by applying Cox proportional hazards
frailty models with transplantation center as a random effect.
RESULTS: Of 10,495 patients, 8,660 (82%) were US citizens, 1,489 (14%) were
permanent residents, and 346 (3%) were nonresident aliens, whom we assumed were
undocumented immigrants. Nonresident aliens were younger, healthier, receiving
dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a living donor. 71% underwent
transplantation in California, and 61% underwent transplantation after 2005.
Nonresident aliens had a lower unadjusted risk for transplant loss compared with 
US citizens (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still
significant when adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, dialysis, and
transplant-related factors (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94).
LIMITATIONS: Citizenship status was self-reported, possible residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the select group of insured nonresident
aliens who undergo transplantation with Medicaid do just as well as US citizens
with Medicaid. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for kidney
transplantation in nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, given
the associated high-quality outcomes in these patients.

To assess whether biopsy-guided selection of kidneys from very old brain-dead
donors enables more successful transplantations, the authors of this multicenter,
observational study compared graft survival between 37 recipients of 1 or 2
histologically evaluated kidneys from donors older than 80 years and 198
reference-recipients of non-histologically evaluated single grafts from donors
aged 60 years and younger (transplantation period: 2006-2013 at 3 Italian
centers). During a median (interquartile range) of 25 (13-42) months, 2
recipients (5.4%) and 10 reference-recipients (5.1%) required dialysis (crude and
donor age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.55
[0.34-7.12], P = .576 and 1.41 [0.10-19.54], P = .798, respectively). Shared
frailty analyses confirmed similar outcomes in a 1:2 propensity score study
comparing recipients with 74 reference-recipients matched by center, year, donor,
and recipient sex and age. Serum creatinine was similar across groups during
84-month follow-up. Recipients had remarkably shorter waiting times than did
reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (7.5 [4.0-19.5] vs 36
[19-56] and 40 [24-56] months, respectively, P < .0001 for both comparisons).
Mean (± SD) kidney donor risk index was 2.57 ± 0.32 in recipients vs 1.09 ± 0.24 
and 1.14 ± 0.24 in reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients
(P < .0001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were similar across groups.
Biopsy-guided allocation of kidneys from octogenarian donors permits further
expansion of the donor organ pool and faster access to a kidney transplant,
without increasing the risk of premature graft failure.

Prediction models for post-kidney transplantation mortality have had limited
success (C-statistics ≤0.70). Adding objective measures of potentially modifiable
factors may improve prediction and, consequently, kidney transplant (KT) survival
through intervention. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is an easily 
administered objective test of lower extremity function consisting of three parts
(balance, walking speed, chair stands), each with scores of 0-4, for a composite 
score of 0-12, with higher scores indicating better function. SPPB performance
and frailty (Fried frailty phenotype) were assessed at admission for KT in a
prospective cohort of 719 KT recipients at Johns Hopkins Hospital (8/2009 to
6/2016) and University of Michigan (2/2013 to 12/2016). The independent
associations between SPPB impairment (SPPB composite score ≤10) and composite
score with post-KT mortality were tested using adjusted competing risks models
treating graft failure as a competing risk. The 5-year posttransplantation
mortality for impaired recipients was 20.6% compared to 4.5% for unimpaired
recipients (p < 0.001). Impaired recipients had a 2.30-fold (adjusted hazard
ratio [aHR] 2.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-4.74, p = 0.02) increased
risk of postkidney transplantation mortality compared to unimpaired recipients.
Each one-point decrease in SPPB score was independently associated with a
1.19-fold (95% CI 1.09-1.30, p < 0.001) higher risk of post-KT mortality.
SPPB-derived lower extremity function is a potentially highly useful and
modifiable objective measure for pre-KT risk prediction.

It is often of interest to compare centers or healthcare providers on quality of 
care delivered. We consider the setting where evaluation of center performance on
multiple competing events is of interest. We propose estimating center effects
through cause-specific proportional hazards frailty models that allow correlation
among a center's cause-specific effects. Estimation of our model proceeds via
penalized partial likelihood and is implemented in R. To evaluate center
performance, we also propose a directly standardized excess cumulative incidence 
(ECI) measure. Therefore, based on our proposed methods, practitioners can
evaluate centers either through the cause-specific hazards or the cumulative
incidence functions. We demonstrate, through simulations, the advantages of the
proposed methods to detect outlying centers, by comparing the proposed methods
and existing methods which assume uncorrelated random center effects. In
addition, we develop a Correlation Score Test to test the null hypothesis that
the competing event processes within a center are correlated. Using data from the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we apply our method to evaluate the

Many patients become frail with diminished cardiorespiratory fitness while
awaiting kidney transplantation. Frailty and poor fitness powerfully predict
mortality, transplant graft survival, and healthcare utilization after kidney
transplantation. Efforts to intervene with post-transplant physical therapy have 
been met with limited success, in large part due to high study dropout. We
reviewed the literature on chronic kidney disease and exercise to propose a
clinical framework for physical therapy interventions to improve fitness,
scheduled for before the transplant. This framework may lead to better patient
retention and compliance, and thus demonstrate better efficacy in mitigating the 
effects of frailty and poor fitness after kidney transplantation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older kidney transplant recipients are susceptible to 
cognitive impairment, frailty, comorbidities, immunosuppression-related
complications, and chronic graft failure, however, there has been limited focus
on their concerns and expectations related to transplantation. This study aims to
describe the perspectives of older kidney transplant recipients about their
experience of kidney transplantation, self-management, and treatment goals to
inform strategies and interventions that address their specific needs.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Face-to-face semistructured
interviews were conducted with 30 kidney transplant recipients aged 65-80 years
from five renal units in Australia. Transcripts were analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: Six themes were identified: restoring vitality of youth (with subthemes 
of revived mindset for resilience, embracing enjoyment in life, drive for
self-actualization); persisting through prolonged recovery (yielding to aging,
accepting functional limitations, pushing the limit, enduring treatment
responsibilities); imposing sicknesses (combatting devastating comorbidities,
painful restrictions, emerging disillusionment, anxieties about accumulating side
effects, consuming treatment burden); prioritizing graft survival (privileged
with a miracle, negotiating risks for longevity, enacting a moral duty,
preserving the last opportunity); confronting health deterioration (vulnerability
and helplessness, narrowing focus to immediate concerns, uncertainty of
survival); and value of existence (purpose through autonomy, refusing the burden 
of futile treatment, staying alive by all means).
CONCLUSIONS: Older kidney transplant recipients felt able to enjoy life and
strived to live at their newly re-established potential and capability, which
motivated them to protect their graft. However, some felt constrained by slow
recuperation and overwhelmed by unexpected comorbidities, medication-related side
effects, and health decline. Our findings suggest the need to prepare and support
older recipients for self-management responsibilities, clarify their expectations
of post-transplant risks and outcomes, and provide assistance through prolonged
recovery after kidney transplantation.

The number of older end-stage renal disease patients being referred for kidney
transplantation continues to increase. This rise is occurring alongside the
continually increasing prevalence of older end-stage renal disease patients.
Although older kidney transplant recipients have decreased patient and graft
survival compared to younger patients, transplantation in this patient population
is pursued due to the survival advantage that it confers over remaining on the
deceased donor waiting list. The upper limit of age and the extent of comorbidity
and frailty at which transplantation ceases to be advantageous is not known.
Transplant physicians are therefore faced with the challenge of determining who
among older patients are appropriate candidates for kidney transplantation. This 
is usually achieved by means of an organ systems-based medical evaluation with
particular focus given to cardiovascular health. More recently, global measures
of health such as functional status and frailty are increasingly being recognized
as potential tools in risk stratifying kidney transplant candidates. For those
candidates who are deemed eligible, living donor transplantation should be
pursued. This may mean accepting a kidney from an older living donor. In the
absence of any living donor, the choice to accept lesser quality kidneys should
be made while taking into account the organ shortage and expected waiting times
on the deceased donor list. Appropriate counseling of patients should be a
cornerstone in the evaluation process and includes a discussion regarding
expected outcomes, expected waiting times in the setting of the new Kidney
Allocation System, benefits of living donor transplantation and the acceptance of
lesser quality kidneys.

BACKGROUND: Frailty increases early hospital readmission and mortality risk among
kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. Although frailty represents a high-risk
state for this population, the correlates of frailty, the patterns of the 5
frailty components, and the risk associated with these patterns are unclear.
METHODS: Six hundred sixty-three KT recipients were enrolled in a cohort study of
frailty in transplantation (12/2008-8/2015). Frailty, activities of daily living 
(ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) disability, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale depression, education, and health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) were measured. We used multinomial regression to identify frailty
correlates. We identified which patterns of the 5 components were associated with
mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 19.5%. Older recipients (adjusted prevalence
ratio [PR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.07) were more likely to be
frail. The only other factors that were independently associated with frailty
were IADL disability (PR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.72-6.06), depressive symptoms (PR,
11.31; 95% CI, 4.02-31.82), less than a high school education (PR, 3.10; 95% CI, 
1.30-7.36), and low HRQOL (fair/poor: PR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.48-9.31). The most
common pattern was poor grip strength, low physical activity, and slowed walk
speed (19.4%). Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged as having an
association with post-KT mortality. KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed
walking speed (hazards ratio = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.17-5.03) and poor grip strength,
exhaustion, and slowed walking speed (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.14-5.97) were
at increased mortality risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty among
KT recipients; however, factors rarely measured as part of clinical practice,
namely, HRQOL, IADL disability, and depressive symptoms, were significant
correlates of frailty. Redefining the frailty phenotype may be needed to improve 
risk stratification for KT recipients.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

AIM: To present the rationale, design and methodology of the GERAS project, which
examines whether assessment of frailty and mild cognitive impairment could
enhance risk prediction for biomedical, psychosocial outcomes and foster
efficient resource allocation in kidney transplantation.
BACKGROUND: For the burgeoning cohort of older patients considered for kidney
transplantation, evidence gaps regarding frailty and mild cognitive impairment
limit clinical decision-making and medical management. As known risk factors for 
'hard' clinical outcomes in chronic illness, both require further study in
transplantation. Integrating these and other bio-psychosocial factors into a
comprehensive pre-transplant patient assessment will provide insights regarding
economic implications and may improve risk prediction.
DESIGN: A nation-wide multi-centre prospective cohort study nested in the Swiss
Transplant Cohort Study.
METHODS: Our nationally representative convenience sample includes 250 adult
kidney transplant recipients. Data sources include the Swiss Transplant Cohort
Study and primary data collected at time of transplantation, 6 months, 1 and
2 years post-transplant via established measures (the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment, Psychosocial Questionnaire, Fried Frailty Instrument and a blood
analysis), investigator-developed instruments and datasets compiled by hospitals'
management control units, sickness funds, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office
and the European Renal Association. Descriptive, competing risk survival and
mixed effects analyses will be performed. Research Ethics Committee approval was 
obtained in January 2016.
DISCUSSION: This pioneering project jointly examines frailty and mild cognitive
impairment from bio-psychosocial and health economic perspectives. Results may
significantly inform risk prediction, care tailoring and resource optimization to
improve health outcomes in the ageing kidney transplant cohort.

PURPOSE: Although a population's senescence rate is classically measured as the
increase in mortality rate with age on a logarithmic scale, it may be more
accurately measured as the increase on a linear scale. Patients on dialysis, who 
suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality
rate on a logarithmic scale, but a larger increase on a linear scale than
patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be
biased by population heterogeneity.
METHODS: Follow-up data on 323,308 patients on dialysis and 91,679 patients with 
a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We
measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models
that allow individual variation in this increase.
RESULTS: According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase 
in mortality rate on a logarithmic scale was smaller in patients on dialysis,
while the senescence rate measured as the increase on a linear scale was larger
in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant.
CONCLUSIONS: Also when accounting for population heterogeneity, a population's
senescence rate is more accurately measured as the increase in mortality rate on 
a linear scale than a logarithmic scale.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether frailty, a novel measure of physiologic reserve, is
associated with longer kidney transplant (KT) length of stay (LOS), and modifies 
the association between LOS and mortality.
BACKGROUND: Better understanding of LOS is necessary for informed consent and
discharge planning. Mortality resulting from longer LOS has important regulatory 
implications for hospital and transplant programs. Which recipients are at risk
of prolonged LOS and its effect on mortality are unclear. Frailty is a novel
preoperative predictor of poor KT outcomes including delayed graft function,
early hospital readmission, immunosuppression intolerance, and mortality.
METHODS: We used registry-augmented hybrid methods, a novel approach to risk
adjustment, to adjust for LOS risk factors from the Scientific Registry of
Transplant Recipients (n = 74,859) and tested whether (1) frailty, measured
immediately before KT in a novel cohort (n = 589), was associated with LOS (LOS: 
negative binomial regression; LOS ≥2 weeks: logistic regression) and (2) whether 
frailty modified the association between LOS and mortality (interaction term
analysis).
RESULTS: Frailty was independently associated with longer LOS [relative risk =
1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.29; P = 0.01] and LOS ≥2 weeks (odds
ratio = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.06-2.33; P = 0.03) after accounting for registry-based
risk factors, including delayed graft function. Frailty also attenuated the
association between LOS and mortality (nonfrail hazard rate = 1.55 95% CI:
1.30-1.86; P < 0.001; frail hazard rate = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.19, P = 0.80; P
for interaction = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail KT recipients are more likely to experience a longer LOS.
Longer LOS among nonfrail recipients may be a marker of increased mortality risk.
Frailty is a measure of physiologic reserve that may be an important clinical
marker of longer surgical LOS.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation offers improved survival and quality of life
to an increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease.
However, elderly kidney transplant recipients may face unique challenges due to a
higher burden of comorbidity, greater cumulative risk of
immunosuppression-related complications and increasing frailty. We aimed to
describe the perspectives of elderly kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to April 2015. Qualitative studies
were eligible if they reported views from elderly kidney transplant recipients
(≥60 years). Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the findings.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving >116 recipients were included. We
identified seven themes. 'Regaining strength and vitality' meant valuing the
physical and psychosocial improvements in daily functioning and life
participation. 'Extending life' was the willingness to accept any organ,
including extended criteria kidneys, to prolong survival. 'Debt of gratitude'
entailed conscious appreciation toward their donor while knowing they were unable
to repay their sacrifice. 'Moral responsibility to maintain health' motivated
adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations out of an ethical duty to
protect their gift for graft survival. 'Unabating and worsening forgetfulness'
hindered self-management. 'Disillusionment with side effects and complications'
reflected disappointment and exasperation with the unintended consequences of
medications. 'Finality of treatment option' was an acute awareness that the
current transplant may be their last.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation was perceived to slow and even reverse the
experience of aging among elderly recipients, especially compared with dialysis. 
However, some were frustrated over persistent limitations after transplant,
struggled with the burden of medication side effects and worried about a possible
return to dialysis if the transplant failed. Clarifying patient expectations of
transplantation, providing support to alleviate the debilitating impacts of
immunosuppression and addressing fears about deteriorating health and graft
failure may improve satisfaction and outcomes in elderly kidney transplant
recipients.

This paper extends dynamic prediction by landmarking to recurrent event data. The
motivating data comprised post-kidney transplantation records of repeated
infections and repeated measurements of multiple markers. At each landmark time
point ts, a Cox proportional hazards model with a frailty term was fitted using
data of individuals who were at risk at landmark s. This model included the
time-updated marker values at ts as time-fixed covariates. Based on a stacked
data set that merged all landmark data sets, we considered supermodels that allow
parameters to depend on the landmarks in a smooth fashion. We described and
evaluated four ways to parameterize the supermodels for recurrent event data.
With both the study data and simulated data sets, we compared supermodels that
were fitted on stacked data sets that consisted of either overlapping or
non-overlapping landmark periods. We observed that for recurrent event data, the 
supermodels may yield biased estimates when overlapping landmark periods are used
for stacking. Using the best supermodel amongst the ones considered, we

There are several immunological and non-immunological factors related to renal
graft deterioration, and histological lesions such as interstitial fibrosis and
tubular atrophy overlap with those observed in aging kidneys. Consequently, it
has been proposed that kidney transplant senescence could contribute to graft
loss. The process of cell senescence displays characteristics such as an
increased expression of specific aging suppressor genes, shortened telomeres,
mitochondrial changes, increased expression of negative regulators of the cell
cycle, and immunological senescence. Additionally, tubular frailty characterizes 
the aged kidney, making it more susceptible to ischemia, reperfusion, toxic
injury, and consequently, to inflammation. Moreover, renal tissue injury
predisposes the older graft not only to progressive deterioration due to
glomerular hyperfiltration, but also triggers acute rejection due to increased
immunogenicity. In conclusion, renal graft senescence is a complex process, and
its better understanding will help the nephrologist in its management in order to
achieve a longer graft survival.

Alto, California, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is the concept of accumulating physiologic declines
that make people less able to deal with stressors, including surgery.
Prehabilitation is intervention to enhance functional capacity before surgery.
Frailty and prehabilitation among transplant populations and the role of wearable
fitness tracking devices (WFTs) in delivering fitness-based interventions will be
discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty is associated with increased complications, longer
length of hospital stay and increased mortality after surgery. Frail kidney
transplant patients have increased delayed graft function, mortality and early
hospital readmission. Frail lung or liver transplant patients are more likely to 
delist or die on the waitlist. Prehabilitation can mitigate frailty and has
resulted in decreased length of hospital stay and fewer postsurgical
complications among a variety of surgical populations. Increasingly, WFTs are
used to monitor patient activity and improve patient health. Interventions using 
WFTs have resulted in improved activity, weight loss and blood pressure.
SUMMARY: Frailty is a measurable parameter that identifies patients at risk for
worse health outcomes and can be mitigated through intervention. Prehabilitation 
to reduce frailty has been shown to improve postsurgical outcomes in a variety of
populations. WFTs are being integrated in healthcare delivery for monitoring and 
changing health behavior with promising results.

Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among
the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample
evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the
best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to
remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this
population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive
impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to
transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after
transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and
affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can
increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death
with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney
allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft
utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer
wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to
kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and
propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are life-threatening
complications after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only
half of CD20-positive PTLDs respond to rituximab monotherapy, and outcomes remain
poor for patients with relapsed/refractory disease, especially those who do not
qualify for an anthracycline containing regimen due to frailty or comorbidities. 
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) might be an option in this particular setting. We report
a panel of eight patients with rituximab refractory/relapsed CD20-positive PTLDs 
including three ineligible for subsequent CHOP-like chemotherapy who received
(90) Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan as a single agent (n = 7) or combined to chemotherapy
(n = 1). Five out of eight patients were kidney transplant recipients, while 2/8 
had a liver transplant and 1/8 had a heart transplant. Patients received a median
of two previous therapies. Overall response rate was 62.5%. Importantly, all
responders achieved complete response. At a median follow-up of 37 months [5;
84], complete response was ongoing in four patients. Toxicity was predominantly
hematological and easily manageable. No graft rejection was noticed concomitantly
or following RIT administration despite immunosuppression reduction after
diagnosis of PTLDs. This report emphasizes the potential efficiency of salvage
RIT for early rituximab refractory PTLDs without any unexpected toxicity.

Therapeutic alternatives and palliative care for advanced renal disease in the
very elderly: a review of the literature.

The overall number of very elderly patients (>79 years of age) requiring renal
replacement therapy is rising in the Western societies, with a choice for
managing advanced chronic renal disease among hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
kidney transplant, conservative, or palliative care. The selection of the most
adequate alternatives should be tailored to meet individual needs, considering
variables such as patient's choice, clinical status, and social context, analyzed
from a geriatric perspective, aiming not only to prolong patient's life
expectancy, but also to improve the patient's quality of life. Frailty and
sarcopenia are highly prevalent comorbidities found in very elderly population,
particularly in the end-stage chronic renal disease population. Both
comorbidities have a strong negative impact on health general status, and
specific treatment should be provided in conjunction with the selected management
for renal replacement, except when a palliative care has been implemented.
Moreover, the detected degree of frailty in a renal patient can have an important
influence on the decision about which modality of renal replacement treatment
will be selected. All these alternatives and considerations are discussed in the 
present review article.

BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose reduction 
or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead to rejection and
possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known about what factors might
cause or contribute to MDR. Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is
emerging as an important, novel domain of risk in kidney transplantation
recipients. We hypothesized that frailty, an inflammatory phenotype, might be
associated with MDR.
METHODS: We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical
activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor characteristics,
longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 kidney transplantation recipients. 
Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: By 2 years after transplantation, 54% of frail recipients and 45% of
nonfrail recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67% and 51%. Frail
recipients were 1.29 times (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.66; P =
0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased donor recipients (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.44-2.54, P < 0.001) and older adults (age ≥
65 vs <65; aHR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.96, P = 0.01). Mycophenolate mofetil dose
reduction was independently associated with a substantially increased risk of
death-censored graft loss (aHR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.97-13.98, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A better understanding of risk factors for MMF intolerance might help
in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression and
prolong allograft survival.

We have previously described strong associations between frailty, a measure of
physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, and early
hospital readmission as well as delayed graft function. The goal of this study
was to estimate its association with postkidney transplantation (post-KT)
mortality. Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of
transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional hazards
models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to substantially
improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We
precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of
the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients (n = 37 858) and introduced
these into the single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty
coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5%, 86.0% and 77.5% for nonfrail, 
intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was
independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.01-4.65, p = 0.047) higher
risk of death. In conclusion, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent
risk factor for post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many
confounders using a novel, efficient statistical approach.

This paper presents an extension of the joint modeling strategy for the case of
multiple longitudinal outcomes and repeated infections of different types over
time, motivated by postkidney transplantation data. Our model comprises two parts
linked by shared latent terms. On the one hand is a multivariate mixed linear
model with random effects, where a low-rank thin-plate spline function is
incorporated to collect the nonlinear behavior of the different profiles over
time. On the other hand is an infection-specific Cox model, where the dependence 
between different types of infections and the related times of infection is
through a random effect associated with each infection type to catch the within
dependence and a shared frailty parameter to capture the dependence between
infection types. We implemented the parameterization used in joint models which
uses the fitted longitudinal measurements as time-dependent covariates in a
relative risk model. Our proposed model was implemented in OpenBUGS using the
MCMC approach.

The ability to predict outcomes following a kidney transplant is limited by the
complex physiologic decline of kidney failure, a latent factor that is difficult 
to capture using conventional comorbidity assessment. The frailty phenotype is a 
recently described inflammatory state of increased vulnerability to stressors
resulting from decreased physiologic reserve and dysregulation of multiple
physiologic systems. We hypothesized that frailty would be associated with
delayed graft function, based on putative associations between inflammatory
cytokines and graft dysfunction. We prospectively measured frailty in 183 kidney 
transplant recipients between December 2008 and April 2010. Independent
associations between frailty and delayed graft function were analyzed using
modified Poisson regression. Preoperative frailty was independently associated
with a 1.94-fold increased risk for delayed graft function (95% CI, 1.13-3.36; P 
= .02). The assessment of frailty may provide further insights into the
pathophysiology of allograft dysfunction and may improve our ability to
preoperatively risk-stratify kidney transplant recipients.

Relative risk frailty models are used extensively in analyzing clustered and/or
recurrent time-to-event data. In this paper, Laplace's approximation for
integrals is applied to marginal distributions of data arising from parametric
relative risk frailty models. Under regularity conditions, the approximate
maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) are consistent with a rate of convergence
that depends on both the number of subjects and number of members per subject. We
compare the approximate MLE against alternative estimators using limited
simulation and demonstrate the utility of Laplace's approximation approach by
analyzing U.S. patient waiting time to deceased kidney transplant data.

Duration time models often should include correlated failure times, due to
clustered data. These random effects hierarchical models sometimes are called
"frailty models" when used for survival analyses. The data analyzed here involve 
such correlations because patient level outcomes (the times until graft failure
following kidney transplantation) are observed, but patients are clustered in
different transplant centers. We describe fitting such models by combining two
kinds of software, one for parametric survival regression models, and the other
for doing Poisson regression in a hierarchical setting. The latter is implemented
by using PRIMM (Poisson Regression and Interactive Multilevel Modeling) methods
and software (Christiansen & Morris, 1994a). An illustrative example for
profiling data is included with k = 11 kidney transplant centers and N = 412
patients.
