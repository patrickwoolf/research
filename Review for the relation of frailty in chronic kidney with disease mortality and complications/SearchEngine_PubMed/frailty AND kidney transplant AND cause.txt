Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after
transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for
nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period
are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa …), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or
Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical
antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and
bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation,
pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H.
influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take
advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to 
six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many
years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial
pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of
pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in
diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney
transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with
co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome,
increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common
opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant
recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and 
Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of
immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective
therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy
should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

BACKGROUND: Although individuals classified as nonresident aliens, including
undocumented immigrants, are entitled to receive emergency dialysis in the United
States regardless of their ability to pay, most states do not provide them with
subsidized care for maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation. We explored
whether nonresident aliens have similar outcomes to US citizens after receiving
kidney transplants covered by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health
insurance program.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adult Medicaid patients in the US Renal Data System
who received their first kidney transplant from 1990 to 2011.
PREDICTOR: Citizenship status, categorized as US citizen, nonresident alien, or
permanent resident.
OUTCOME: All-cause transplant loss.
MEASUREMENTS: HRs and 95% CIs estimated by applying Cox proportional hazards
frailty models with transplantation center as a random effect.
RESULTS: Of 10,495 patients, 8,660 (82%) were US citizens, 1,489 (14%) were
permanent residents, and 346 (3%) were nonresident aliens, whom we assumed were
undocumented immigrants. Nonresident aliens were younger, healthier, receiving
dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a living donor. 71% underwent
transplantation in California, and 61% underwent transplantation after 2005.
Nonresident aliens had a lower unadjusted risk for transplant loss compared with 
US citizens (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still
significant when adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, dialysis, and
transplant-related factors (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94).
LIMITATIONS: Citizenship status was self-reported, possible residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the select group of insured nonresident
aliens who undergo transplantation with Medicaid do just as well as US citizens
with Medicaid. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for kidney
transplantation in nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, given
the associated high-quality outcomes in these patients.

It is often of interest to compare centers or healthcare providers on quality of 
care delivered. We consider the setting where evaluation of center performance on
multiple competing events is of interest. We propose estimating center effects
through cause-specific proportional hazards frailty models that allow correlation
among a center's cause-specific effects. Estimation of our model proceeds via
penalized partial likelihood and is implemented in R. To evaluate center
performance, we also propose a directly standardized excess cumulative incidence 
(ECI) measure. Therefore, based on our proposed methods, practitioners can
evaluate centers either through the cause-specific hazards or the cumulative
incidence functions. We demonstrate, through simulations, the advantages of the
proposed methods to detect outlying centers, by comparing the proposed methods
and existing methods which assume uncorrelated random center effects. In
addition, we develop a Correlation Score Test to test the null hypothesis that
the competing event processes within a center are correlated. Using data from the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we apply our method to evaluate the
performance of Organ Procurement Organizations on two competing risks: (i)
receipt of a kidney transplant and (ii) death on the wait-list.

PURPOSE: Although a population's senescence rate is classically measured as the
increase in mortality rate with age on a logarithmic scale, it may be more
accurately measured as the increase on a linear scale. Patients on dialysis, who 
suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality
rate on a logarithmic scale, but a larger increase on a linear scale than
patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be
biased by population heterogeneity.
METHODS: Follow-up data on 323,308 patients on dialysis and 91,679 patients with 
a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We
measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models
that allow individual variation in this increase.
RESULTS: According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase 
in mortality rate on a logarithmic scale was smaller in patients on dialysis,
while the senescence rate measured as the increase on a linear scale was larger
in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant.
CONCLUSIONS: Also when accounting for population heterogeneity, a population's
senescence rate is more accurately measured as the increase in mortality rate on 
a linear scale than a logarithmic scale.

Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among
the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample
evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the
best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to
remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this
population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive
impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to
transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after
transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and
affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can
increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death
with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney
allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft
utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer
wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to
kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and
propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose reduction 
or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead to rejection and
possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known about what factors might
cause or contribute to MDR. Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is
emerging as an important, novel domain of risk in kidney transplantation
recipients. We hypothesized that frailty, an inflammatory phenotype, might be
associated with MDR.
METHODS: We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical
activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor characteristics,
longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 kidney transplantation recipients. 
Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: By 2 years after transplantation, 54% of frail recipients and 45% of
nonfrail recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67% and 51%. Frail
recipients were 1.29 times (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.66; P =
0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased donor recipients (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.44-2.54, P < 0.001) and older adults (age ≥
65 vs <65; aHR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.96, P = 0.01). Mycophenolate mofetil dose
reduction was independently associated with a substantially increased risk of
death-censored graft loss (aHR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.97-13.98, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A better understanding of risk factors for MMF intolerance might help
in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression and
prolong allograft survival.
