End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 2% to 4% of patients with
severe aortic stenosis. It is because these patients have been excluded from
clinical trials, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in 
this patient group has not been thoroughly investigated. Between April 2008 and
March 2015, 2,000 patients (dialysis group, n = 56 [2.8%]) were consecutively
enrolled when diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and eligible to undergo TAVI.
Procedural and longer-term outcomes were analyzed and adjusted for differences in
baseline characteristics. Patients on dialysis had a higher periprocedural
mortality (10.7% vs 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 5.65, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.91 to 16.67; p = 0.002) and a lower Valve Academic Research
Consortium (VARC)-II (VARC) defined device success (adjOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to
0.79; p = 0.012). At 30 days, there was an increased rate of all-cause mortality 
(21.4 vs 4.8%; adjOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.96 to 12.26; p = 0.001), cardiovascular
(adjOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.41; p = 0.007) and noncardiovascular mortality
(adjOR 6.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 9.41; p = 0.019), myocardial infarction (adjOR 9.39, 
95% CI 1.84 to 48.03; p = 0.007), bleeding (adjOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.83;
p = 0.036) as well as the VARC-II defined early safety combined end point (adjOR 
2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.90; p = 0.012) associated with dialysis. Dialysis was
associated with poor survival at one (57.1% vs 84.2%) and 3 years (26.8% vs
66.9%) with or without the consideration of the first 72 hours (p <0.001;
adjusted p <0.001). Although, in the multivariable regression analysis, reduced
ejection fraction, peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH),
frailty and dialysis were associated with 1-year mortality, only PH (>60 mm Hg)
remained significant in an analysis restricted to the dialysis patients (adjusted
hazard ratio 2.68; 95% CI 1.18 to 5.88; p = 0.018). PH had a sensitivity of
45.8%, a specificity of 81.3%, and a positive predictive value of 64.7%. In
conclusion, dialysis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who
underwent TAVI. Long-term mortality in dialysis patients appears to be largely
determined by the kidney disease and/or dialysis itself whereas VARC-II defined
complications are largely unaffected. An increased short-term mortality still
calls for (pre-) procedural optimization.

AIM: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been
diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty,
but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with
frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study
to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic
hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited.
Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered
diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not
(Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the
prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined
the risk factors for frailty.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than 
that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the
association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients
(n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their
interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic
nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic
nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18:

BACKGROUND: Although individuals classified as nonresident aliens, including
undocumented immigrants, are entitled to receive emergency dialysis in the United
States regardless of their ability to pay, most states do not provide them with
subsidized care for maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation. We explored
whether nonresident aliens have similar outcomes to US citizens after receiving
kidney transplants covered by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health
insurance program.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adult Medicaid patients in the US Renal Data System
who received their first kidney transplant from 1990 to 2011.
PREDICTOR: Citizenship status, categorized as US citizen, nonresident alien, or
permanent resident.
OUTCOME: All-cause transplant loss.
MEASUREMENTS: HRs and 95% CIs estimated by applying Cox proportional hazards
frailty models with transplantation center as a random effect.
RESULTS: Of 10,495 patients, 8,660 (82%) were US citizens, 1,489 (14%) were
permanent residents, and 346 (3%) were nonresident aliens, whom we assumed were
undocumented immigrants. Nonresident aliens were younger, healthier, receiving
dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a living donor. 71% underwent
transplantation in California, and 61% underwent transplantation after 2005.
Nonresident aliens had a lower unadjusted risk for transplant loss compared with 
US citizens (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still
significant when adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, dialysis, and
transplant-related factors (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94).
LIMITATIONS: Citizenship status was self-reported, possible residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the select group of insured nonresident
aliens who undergo transplantation with Medicaid do just as well as US citizens
with Medicaid. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for kidney
transplantation in nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, given
the associated high-quality outcomes in these patients.

Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

It is often of interest to compare centers or healthcare providers on quality of 
care delivered. We consider the setting where evaluation of center performance on
multiple competing events is of interest. We propose estimating center effects
through cause-specific proportional hazards frailty models that allow correlation
among a center's cause-specific effects. Estimation of our model proceeds via
penalized partial likelihood and is implemented in R. To evaluate center
performance, we also propose a directly standardized excess cumulative incidence 
(ECI) measure. Therefore, based on our proposed methods, practitioners can
evaluate centers either through the cause-specific hazards or the cumulative
incidence functions. We demonstrate, through simulations, the advantages of the
proposed methods to detect outlying centers, by comparing the proposed methods
and existing methods which assume uncorrelated random center effects. In
addition, we develop a Correlation Score Test to test the null hypothesis that
the competing event processes within a center are correlated. Using data from the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we apply our method to evaluate the
performance of Organ Procurement Organizations on two competing risks: (i)
receipt of a kidney transplant and (ii) death on the wait-list.

PURPOSE: Although a population's senescence rate is classically measured as the
increase in mortality rate with age on a logarithmic scale, it may be more
accurately measured as the increase on a linear scale. Patients on dialysis, who 
suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality
rate on a logarithmic scale, but a larger increase on a linear scale than
patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be
biased by population heterogeneity.
METHODS: Follow-up data on 323,308 patients on dialysis and 91,679 patients with 
a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We
measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models
that allow individual variation in this increase.
RESULTS: According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase 
in mortality rate on a logarithmic scale was smaller in patients on dialysis,
while the senescence rate measured as the increase on a linear scale was larger
in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant.
CONCLUSIONS: Also when accounting for population heterogeneity, a population's
senescence rate is more accurately measured as the increase in mortality rate on 
a linear scale than a logarithmic scale.

IMPORTANCE: Efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on
patients with cancer. High-quality end-of-life care is also critical for patients
with other illnesses.
OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of end-of-life care and family-rated quality of
care for patients dying with different serious illnesses.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was
conducted in all 146 inpatient facilities within the Veteran Affairs health
system among patients who died in inpatient facilities between October 1, 2009,
and September 30, 2012, with clinical diagnoses categorized as end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), cancer, cardiopulmonary failure (congestive heart failure or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), dementia, frailty, or other conditions.
Data analysis was conducted from April 1, 2014, to February 10, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Palliative care consultations, do-not-resuscitate
orders, death in inpatient hospices, death in the intensive care unit, and
family-reported quality of end-of-life care.
RESULTS: Among 57 753 decedents, approximately half of the patients with ESRD,
cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty received palliative care consultations
(adjusted proportions, 50.4%, 46.7%, and 43.7%, respectively) vs 73.5% of
patients with cancer and 61.4% of patients with dementia (P < .001).
Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or
frailty (adjusted proportions, 32.3%, 34.1%, and 35.2%, respectively) died in the
intensive care unit, more than double the rates among patients with cancer and
those with dementia (13.4% and 8.9%, respectively) (P < .001). Rates of excellent
quality of end-of-life care reported by 34 005 decedents' families were similar
for patients with cancer and those with dementia (adjusted proportions, 59.2% and
59.3%; P = .61), but lower for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or
frailty (54.8%, 54.8%, and 53.7%, respectively; all P ≤ .02 vs patients with
cancer). This quality advantage was mediated by palliative care consultation,
setting of death, and a code status of do-not-resuscitate; adjustment for these
variables rendered the association between diagnosis and overall end-of-life care
quality nonsignificant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Family-reported quality of end-of-life care was
significantly better for patients with cancer and those with dementia than for
patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty, largely owing to higher 
rates of palliative care consultation and do-not-resuscitate orders and fewer
deaths in the intensive care unit among patients with cancer and those with
dementia. Increasing access to palliative care and goals of care discussions that
address code status and preferred setting of death, particularly for patients
with end-organ failure and frailty, may improve the overall quality of
end-of-life care for Americans dying of these illnesses.

PURPOSE: Prognosis of the increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) is poor with high risk of functional decline and mortality. 
Frailty seems to be a good predictor for those patients that will not benefit
from dialysis. Varying prevalences between populations are probably related to
the instrument used. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of
frailty among ESRD patients with two different validated instruments.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients, aged ≥18 years,
receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis care between
September 2013 and December 2013 in a single dialysis center in Apeldoorn, the
Netherlands. Frailty was measured with the frailty index (FI) and frailty
phenotype (FP).
RESULTS: Prevalence of frailty by the FI was 36.8 % among 95 participants with
ESRD (age: 65.2 years, SD ± 12.0). Frailty prevalence among participants aged ≥65
and <65 years was 43.6 and 27.5 %, respectively. Female sex [odds ratio (OR) 3.3,
95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.3-8.0] and a Charlson comorbidity index score of 
≥5 (OR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.0-6.6) were associated with frailty. The FI identified
different but overlapping participants as frail compared with the FP; 62.5 % of
frail participants according to FI were also frail according to the FP.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of frailty among young and elderly ESRD patients is high;
being female and having more comorbidity was associated with frailty. Use of a
broader definition of frailty, like the FI, gives a higher estimation of
prevalence among ESRD patients compared with a physical frailty assessment.

BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides
(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

BACKGROUND: For chronic hemodialysis, the ideal permanent vascular access is the 
arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Temporary catheters should be reserved for acute
dialysis needs. The AVF is associated with lower infection rates, better clinical
results, and a higher quality of life and survival when compared to temporary
catheters. In Brazil, the proportion of patients with temporary catheters for
more than 3 months from the beginning of therapy is used as an evaluation of the 
quality of renal units. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated
with the time between the beginning of hemodialysis with temporary catheters and 
the placement of the first arteriovenous fistula in Brazil.
METHODS: This is an observational, prospective non-concurrent study using
national administrative registries of all patients financed by the public health 
system who began renal replacement therapy (RRT) between 2000 and 2004 in Brazil.
Incident patients were eligible who had hemodialysis for the first time. Patients
were excluded who: had hemodialysis reportedly started after the date of death
(inconsistent database); were younger than 18 years old; had HIV; had no record
of the first dialysis unit; and were dialyzed in units with less than twenty
patients. To evaluate individual and renal unit factors associated with the event
of interest, the frailty model was used (N = 55,589).
RESULTS: Among the 23,824 patients (42.9%) who underwent fistula placement in the
period of the study, 18.2% maintained the temporary catheter for more than three 
months until the fistula creation. The analysis identified five statistically
significant factors associated with longer time until first fistula: higher age
(Hazard-risk - HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00); having hypertension and cardiovascular
diseases (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.98) as the cause of chronic renal disease;
residing in capitals cities (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95) and certain regions in
Brazil - South (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.8-0.87), Midwest (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94),
Northeast (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94), or North (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94) and
the type of renal unit (public or private).
CONCLUSION: Monitoring the provision of arteriovenous fistulas in renal units
could improve the care given to patients with end stage renal disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

BACKGROUND: Given the volume and cost of inpatient care during the last year of
life, there is a critical need to identify patterns of dying as a means of
planning end-of-life care services, especially for the growing number of older
persons who receive services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
METHODS: A retrospective computerized record review was conducted of 20,933 VHA
patients who died as inpatients between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002.
Diagnoses were aggregated into one of five classification patterns of death and
analyzed in terms of health care resource utilization (mean number of inpatient
days and cumulative outpatient visits in the year preceding the patient's death).
RESULTS: Cancer deaths were the most common (30.4%) followed by end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) (23.2%), cardiopulmonary failure (21.4%), frailty (11.6%), "other"
diagnoses (7.3%), and sudden deaths (6.1%). Those with ESRD were more likely to
be male and nonwhite (p < 0.05) and those with frailty were more likely to be
older and married (p < 0.05). Controlling for demographic variables, those with
frailty had the highest number of inpatient days while those with ESRD had the
highest number of outpatient visits. Non-married status was associated with more 
inpatient days, especially among younger decedents.
CONCLUSION: As a recognized leader in end-of-life care, the VHA can play a unique
role in the development of specific interventions that address the diverse needs 
of persons with different dying trajectories identified through this research.
