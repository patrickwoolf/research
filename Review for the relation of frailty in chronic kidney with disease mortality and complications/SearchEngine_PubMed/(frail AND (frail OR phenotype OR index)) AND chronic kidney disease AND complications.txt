A significant interaction between kidneys and lungs has been shown in
physiological and pathological conditions. The two organs can both be targets of 
the same systemic disease (eg., some vasculitides). Moreover, loss of normal
function of either of them can induce direct and indirect dysregulation of the
other one. Subjects suffering from COPD may have systemic inflammation,
hypoxemia, endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic activation and
increased aortic stiffness. As well as the exposure to nicotine, all the foresaid
factors can induce a microvascular damage, albuminuria, and a worsening of renal 
function. Renal failure in COPD can be unrecognized since elderly and frail
patients may have normal serum creatinine concentration. Lungs and kidneys
participate in maintaining the acid-base balance. Compensatory role of the lungs 
rapidly expresses through an increase or reduction of ventilation. Renal
compensation usually requires a few days as it is achieved through changes in
bicarbonate reabsorption. Chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal diseases
increase the risk of pneumonia. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumonia and
seasonal influenza is recommended for these patients. Vaccines against the last
very virulent H1N1 influenza A strain are also available and effective. Acute
lung injury and acute kidney injury are frequent complications in critical
illnesses, associated with high morbidity and mortality. The concomitant failure 
of kidneys and lungs implies a multidisciplinary approach, both in terms of
diagnostic processes and therapeutic management.

BACKGROUND: We retrospectively assessed the initial clinical role of preoperative
frailty in surgical patients with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD).
METHODS: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients who underwent emergent or 
urgent surgical interventions for AAAD in our institute between April 2000 and
March 2016 participated in this retrospective study. Patients with more than
three of the following six modalities were defined as being frail: age older than
75 years, preoperative requirement of assistance in daily living, body mass index
less than 18.5 kg/m2, female, history of major stroke, and chronic kidney disease
greater than class 3b. Twenty-three patients (20.2%) were diagnosed with frailty 
(group F), while 91 patients (79.8%) were not (group N). Early clinical outcomes,
major postoperative complications, postoperative recovery of activity, and early 
or mid-term survival were evaluated.
RESULTS: Although early clinical outcomes and the prevalence of major
postoperative complications were similar in both groups, postoperative activity
of daily living (ADL), such as the rate of being ambulatory on discharge
(p < 0.05) and home discharge (p < 0.01), was significantly lower in group F than
in group N. A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 1- and 5-year survival rates
were similar in groups F (85.9 and 76.4%, respectively) and N (86.0 and 76.9%,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative frailty in AAAD surgical patients has potential as a
prognostic factor that affects delays in ADL recovery, but does not influence the
early or mid-term clinical outcomes of prompt surgical strategies for life rescue
in AAAD patients with frailty.

Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of
diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, 
about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years.
Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive
impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly
more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial
disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a
consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a
considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without
any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with
type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into
account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life
expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals
and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically,
overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in
particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used
with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia
are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function
are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

Global burden disease studies point out that one of the top cause-specific
anemias is iron deficiency (ID). Recent advances in knowledge of iron homeostasis
have shown that fragile patients are a new target population in which the
correction of ID might impact their morbidity, mortality and quality of life. We 
did a systematic review using specific search strategy, carried out the review of
PubMed database, Cochrane Database of systemic reviews and international
guidelines on diagnosis and clinical management of ID from 2010 to 2016. The
International guidelines were limited to those with peer-review process and
published in journal present in citation index database. The eligible studies
show that serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are the key tests in early
decision-making process to identify iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The clinician
has to carefully consider fragile and high-risk subset of patients such as elders
or individuals with chronic diseases (i.e chronic kidney disease, inflammatory
bowel disease, chronic heart failure). Treatment is based on iron
supplementation. Infusion route should be preferentially considered in frail
patients especially in the view of new iron available formulations. The available
evidences indicate that (i) recurrent IDA should always be investigated,
considering uncommon causes; (ii) IDA might worse the performance and the
clinical outcome of fragile and high-risk patients and require an intensive
treatment.

Patients with chronic kidney disease experience substantial loss of muscle mass, 
weakness, and poor physical performance. As kidney disease progresses, skeletal
muscle dysfunction forms a common pathway for mobility limitation, loss of
functional independence, and vulnerability to disease complications. Screening
for those at high risk for mobility disability by self-reported and objective
measures of function is an essential first step in developing an
interdisciplinary approach to treatment that includes rehabilitative therapies
and counseling on physical activity. Exercise has beneficial effects on systemic 
inflammation, muscle, and physical performance in chronic kidney disease. Kidney 
health providers need to identify patient and care delivery barriers to exercise 
in order to effectively counsel patients on physical activity. A thorough medical
evaluation and assessment of baseline function using self-reported and objective 
function assessment is essential to guide an effective individualized exercise
prescription to prevent function decline in persons with kidney disease. This
review focuses on the impact of kidney disease on skeletal muscle dysfunction in 
the context of the disablement process and reviews screening and treatment
strategies that kidney health professionals can use in clinical practice to
prevent functional decline and disability.

The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes over the
last decade has resulted in increasing numbers of frail older patients with a
combination of these conditions. Current treatment guidelines may not necessarily
be relevant for such patients, who are mostly excluded from the trials upon which
these recommendations are based. There is a paucity of data upon which to base
the management of older patients with CKD. Nearly all current guidelines
recommend less-tight glycaemic control for the older population, citing the lack 
of proven medium-term benefits and concerns about the high short-term risk of
hypoglycaemia. However, reports from large landmark trials have shown potential
benefits for both microvascular and macrovascular complications, though the
relevance of these findings to this specific population is uncertain. The trials 
have also highlighted potential alternative explanations for the hazards of
intensive glycaemic control. These include depression, low endogenous insulin
reserve, low body mass index and side effects of the medication. Over the last
few years, newer classes of hypoglycaemic drugs with a lower risk of
hypoglycaemia have emerged. This article aims to present a balanced view of
advantages and disadvantages of intense glycaemic control in this group of
patients, which we hope will help the clinician and patient to come to an
individualized management approach.

Elevated blood pressure is one of the most significant risk factor for the
development of chronic kidney disease (CKD); its treatment is a milestone in CKD 
management. While it is accepted that a stricter blood pressure control is
indicated in patients with proteinuria or microalbuminuria, the exact degree of
blood pressure reduction to be obtained in CKD patients is still under debate.
Following more recent interpretation of old trials, a BP target for <140/90 mmHg 
is suggested for non-proteinuric CKD patients. In those with
microalbuminuria/proteinuria, the ideal blood pressure target should be ≤130/80
mmHg. Recently, the SPRINT trial put new emphasis on a stricter blood pressure
control, mainly from the cardiovascular point of view. The blockers of the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are recommended as first line treatment in all CKD
hypertensive patients with micro or macroalbuminuria either diabetics or not.
However, their nephroprotective efficacy is less relevant in non-proteinuric
patients. The dual RAS blockade was proposed as an additional option. Despite a
greater antiproteinuric effect, some large trials in patients at high
cardiovascular risk did not demonstrate significant advantage on hard endpoint.
Its use is now contraindicated in diabetic CKD patients. Given that RAS blockers 
can cause acute derangements in kidney function and hyperkalemia, caution is
needed with their use, especially in frail and old patients with cardiovascular
disease or in the presence of advanced CKD.

BACKGROUND: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including 
adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key
consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures
of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with
complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013).
PREDICTORS: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated
using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine
albumin-creatinine ratio.
OUTCOME: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty
characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical
activity).
RESULTS: 341 (7%) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30%) had
eGFRcr<60mL/min/1.73m2, 2,480 (50%) had eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2, and 1,006 (20%) 
had albuminuria with albumin excretion ≥ 30mg/g. Among frail participants,
prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2 were 45% and 77%, respectively.
Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a 
strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals
with eGFRcr of 60 to <75mL/min/1.73m2 were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR 
categories using eGFRcys (49% to 45-<60, 32% to 30-<45, and 3%
to <30mL/min/1.73m2). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking ≥10 classes of medications) was
more common in frail individuals (54% vs 38% of nonfrail), including classes
requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent
complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants).
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, 
with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys
versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic
kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative
biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this
vulnerable population.

disease?

Metabolic acidosis is common in advanced chronic kidney disease and has been
associated with a range of physiological derangements of importance to the health
of older people. These include associations with skeletal muscle weakness,
cardiovascular risk factors, and bone and mineral disorders that may lead to
fragility fractures. Although metabolic acidosis is associated with accelerated
decline in kidney function, end-stage renal failure is a much less common outcome
in older, frail patients than cardiovascular death. Correction of metabolic
acidosis using bicarbonate therapy is commonly employed, but the existing
evidence is insufficient to know whether such therapy is of net benefit to older 
people. Bicarbonate is bulky and awkward to take, may impose additional sodium
load with effects on fluid retention and blood pressure, and may cause
gastrointestinal side effects. Trial data to date suggest potential benefits of
bicarbonate therapy on progression of renal disease and nutrition, but trials
have not as yet been published examining the effect of bicarbonate therapy across
a range of domains relevant to the health of older people. Fortunately, a number 
of trials are now underway that should allow us to ascertain whether bicarbonate 
therapy can improve physical function, quality of life, and vascular, bone and
kidney health in older people, and hence decide whether any benefits seen
outweigh adverse effects and additional treatment burden in this vulnerable group
of patients.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney
function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in
community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level,
and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0
(normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Frailty status
was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle
weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of
having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were more frail
(odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition,
individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or
hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of
frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. 
Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty 
in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI
1.13-14.1) CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a

A 79-year-old moderately frail man with a history of graft replacement for
descending thoracic aortic aneurysm and chronic kidney disease presented with the
onset of haemoptysis. Computed tomography demonstrated aorto-oesophageal fistula 
secondary to aortic arch aneurysm rupture. Emergency surgery was performed
through a median sternotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established via femoral
artery inflow and bicaval venous drainage. After establishing circulatory arrest,
the aortic arch was excised. Resection of the aortic aneurysm and debridement
were performed during antegrade cerebral perfusion and lower body perfusion from 
femoral artery inflow using balloon occlusion of the previous graft. Aortic arch 
graft replacement with concomitant debridement of mediastinal tissue and direct
repair of oesophageal perforation comprised a first-stage operation. Forty hours 
later, abundant irrigation of warm normal saline around the mediastinal cavity
and the omental flap covering the graft and the repair site of the oesophagus
comprised the second-stage operation. Although the postoperative course was
complicated, the patient resumed oral intake within 2 months after the initial
operation. Serial computed tomography and oesophageal endoscopy showed good
healing of the aorto-oesophageal fistula. There were no clinical manifestations
or imaging findings of deep mediastinal infection throughout the postoperative
course.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

[How I TREAT ... THE ROLE OF DPP-4 INHIBITORS (GLIPTINS) IN THE TREATMENT OF TYPE
2 DIABETES].

[Article in French]

Scheen AJ.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are more and more prominent 
medications in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), with five molecules
commercialized and as many fixed-dose combinations with metformin. After failure 
of metformin monotherapy, gliptins compete with old medications such as
sulphonylureas, on the one hand, or with new oral antidiabetic agents such as
inhibitors of renal sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) (gliflozines),
on the other hand. Another alternative is the use of an incretin mimetic (agonist
of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors, to be injected subcutaneously) rather than 
an incretin enhancer such as a gliptin, before considering insulin therapy. This 
article analyses the arguments in favour of DPP-4 inhibitors. We will mainly
consider the use of gliptins in patients with recently diagnosed T2D, in elderly 
and frail patients and in those with chronic kidney disease. To illustrate the
discussion, we will analyze the results of both interventional and observational 
studies with vildagliptin. Obviously, these various groups of patients represent 
a large proportion of T2D population.

BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of falling is complex, and identification of risk
factors may be essential for prevention. The relationship between renal disease
and falls is unclear, and the goal of this study was to collect the available
evidence and investigate the relationship between accidental falls and renal
dysfunction.
METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid SP and
Web of Science databases to identify the appropriate literature. The themes used 
were: falls (combined in the title/abstract fall or falls or falling or faller*
or fallen or slip* or trip* or (MeSH) accidental falls) and renal insufficiency
(chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases combined in title/abstract
renal disease* or kidney disease* or renal insufficiency or kidney insufficiency 
or kidney failure or renal failure or MeSH renal insufficiency, chronic or renal 
insufficiency or kidney diseases). The incidence, risk factors, complications,
and characteristics of the falls were analyzed.
RESULTS: Eight prospective cohorts including five cross-sectional studies, and
one case-control study were identified. No randomized controlled studies were
found. The incidence of falls in chronic kidney disease patients ranged between
1.18 and 1.60 fall/patient year. These were frequent in frail older adults on
hemodialysis treatment. Falling relapses in the same group of patients caused
serious consequences. Data on pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) were scarce.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of falling appears to be common in patients with renal
dysfunction especially in older adults undergoing hemodialysis. On the other
hand, we could not find any conclusive data on pre-ESRD patients.

The management of diabetes in older people is often challenging and poorly
researched. The prevalence of cognitive impairment, chronic kidney disease and
other co-existing comorbidities increase with age and have a significant impact
on glycaemic control targets and treatment options. This conference examined
current clinical practice, highlighted differences in the management of diabetes 
in the older person and suggested potential areas of future research.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to 
complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and
functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total
number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and
assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD
0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified
Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P =
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good
construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the
potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for
patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition 
with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more
frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other
chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in
pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an
outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was
modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was
used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed 
using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.
RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were
significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those 
who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of
frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was
significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower
physical and mental quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in
pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential
role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of
life.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

This study examined whether chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with
recurrent falls in older adults in nursing homes (NHs). We used data abstracted
over a six month period from 510 NH residents with a history of falls.
Thirty-five percent of the NH residents had CKD. In adjusted analyses, the
incidence of recurrent falls was similar in those with and without CKD [fall rate
ratio (FRR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.02]. Orthostatic
hypotension (FRR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12-2.05), history of falls during the prior six
month period (FRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.49), cane or walker use (FRR 1.64, 95% CI
1.16-2.33), and ambulatory dysfunction (FRR 1.47, 95% CI 1.23-1.75) were
independently associated with increased fall rate. CKD was not an important
predictor of falls in this cohort of nursing home residents with prior falls.
Instead, traditional fall risk factors were much more strongly associated with
recurrent falls.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) have
high morbidity, mortality, and symptom burden. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
congestive heart failure (CHF) often contribute to these burdens and should be
considered when providing recommendations for care. This review aims to summarize
recent literature relevant to the provision of palliative and end-of-life care
for patients with progressive CKD and specifically highlights issues relevant to 
those with CVD and CHF.
RECENT FINDINGS: Dialysis may not benefit older, frail patients with progressive 
CKD, especially those with other comorbidities. Patients managed conservatively
(i.e., without dialysis) may live as long as patients who elect to start
dialysis, with better preservation of function and quality of life and with fewer
acute care admissions. Decisions regarding dialysis initiation should be made on 
an individual basis, keeping in mind each patient's goals, comorbidities, and
underlying functional status. Conservative management of progressive kidney
disease is frequently not offered but is likely to benefit many older, frail
patients with comorbidities such as CHF and CVD.
SUMMARY: A palliative approach to the care of many patients with progressive CKD 
is essential to ensuring they receive appropriate quality care.

Anemia is extremely common following hip fracture. Consistent data from
randomized trials show that transfusion of less blood, with a transfusion
threshold around 8 g/dL hemoglobin concentration, is preferable to a traditional 
threshold of 10 g/dL. Adoption of a lower threshold leads to at least equivalent 
clinical outcomes, with much less exposure to transfusion costs and risks. The
most common complication of transfusion is circulatory overload. Future research 
may elucidate the optimal transfusion threshold for these elderly patients and
address the specific needs of subgroups of patients, including those with acute
coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical
function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness
and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a
heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of
this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general
population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science,
CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD
and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text
review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. 
From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in
patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with
increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. 
In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher 
risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished
physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may 
lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to
understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with
clinical outcomes.

Anemia is an important healthcare concern among the elderly. In these patients,
the anemia is often mild, with a hemoglobin level >10 g/dL. It is usually well
tolerated, but might be responsible for several proteiform and/or atypical
presenting complaints. In the elderly, anemia is usually of multifactorial
origin, including chronic inflammation, chronic kidney disease, nutrient
deficiencies and iron deficiency (approximately two-thirds of all cases). The
remaining cases are unexplained (unknown etiology). In the elderly, the classic
diagnosis of anemia, which is based on the mean corpuscular volume associated
with a low hemoglobin level, might not be accurate. A predefined standardized
diagnostic procedure should be followed. In the common case of frail elderly
patients, all investigations should be carefully considered and invasive
examinations undertaken where justified (risk-benefit balance). Nevertheless,
most cases of anemia require further investigation and the underlying cause
should be identified and treated whenever possible.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 
(KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation,
Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of
kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease
to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of
older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress
to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific
cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older
adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have
shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated 
with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis)
and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally
thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes 
include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research
studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD 
and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the
longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the
oldest old with CKD.

disease: a hypothesis.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults,
affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are
encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap
with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder 
may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded
in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed 
to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is
being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization
and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low
testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of
whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly
CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In
this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone
abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with
CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors 
predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and
treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
importance.

Older adults (aged >or=65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD
population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging.
Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the
frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among
vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical 
performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death.
Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits 
seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a
highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the
trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed 
to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to
identify opportunities to intervene.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney
disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated
criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to 
determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were
associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the
association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly
increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for
the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds 
of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation,
vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and
chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney
disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.
Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection
remain elusive.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many
different populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its
multitude of complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly
higher risk for cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual.
However, it is clear now that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of
the complications but also prevent them. Therefore, various important public
health organizations all over the world have turned their focus and attention to 
CKD and its risk factors, early detection and early intervention. Nevertheless,
the general goals in preventing the increase in CKD and its complications are far
from being completely achieved. Why is this so? What is the magnitude and
complexity of the problem? How is it affecting the population - are there
differences in its affection by age, gender or frail elderly versus the robust?
Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and aggressively? Are there
subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on dialysis versus the
non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of CKD aggressively, 
will it make a difference in the disease progression, its complications or to
quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly succumb to? What 
do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire dialysis or
transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for those who
refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly with
CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist?
The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality 
of life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other
vital aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day
practice by each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the
elderly with men being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively 
the vital aspects of CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical
standpoint.
