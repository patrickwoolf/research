Under normal conditions, inflammation is a protective and physiological response 
to various harmful stimuli. However, in several chronic debilitating disorders,
such as chronic kidney disease, inflammation becomes maladaptive, uncontrolled
and persistent. Systemic persistent inflammation has, for almost 20 years, been
recognized as a major contributor to the uraemic phenotype (such as
cardiovascular disease, protein energy wasting, depression, osteoporosis and
frailty), and a predictor of cardiovascular and total mortality. Since
inflammation is mechanistically related to several ageing processes
(inflammageing), it may be a major driver of a progeric phenotype in the uraemic 
milieu. Inflammation is likely the consequence of a multifactorial aetiology and 
interacts with a number of factors that emerge when uraemic toxins accumulate.
Beside interventions aiming to decrease the production of inflammatory molecules 
in the uraemic milieu, novel strategies to increase the removal of large middle
molecules, such as expanded haemodialysis, may be an opportunity to decrease the 
inflammatory allostatic load associated with retention of middle molecular weight
uraemic toxins.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cognitive and renal impairment are pervasive among elderly
frails, a high-risk, geriatric sub-population with peculiar clinical
characteristics. In a series of frail individuals with non-advanced chronic
kidney disease (CKD), we aimed at assessing the entity of functional, general
health and cognitive impairment and the possible relationship between these types
of dysfunction and the severity of renal impairment.
METHODS: 2229 geriatric subjects were screened for frailty and CKD. Severity of
CKD was assessed by eGFR (CKD-EPI formula). Frailty was established by the Fried 
Index. Functional, general health and cognitive status were assessed by validated
score measures.
RESULTS: Final analysis included 271 frail CKD subjects (162 women, 109 men).
Mean eGFR was 64.25 ± 25.04 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD
(stage 3-4) was 44%. Twenty-six percent of patients had severe cognitive
impairment, while mild and moderate impairment was found in 7 and 67% of
individuals, respectively. All subjects had poor functional and general health
status. Cognitive capacities significantly decreased across CKD stages (p for
trend < 0.0001). In fully adjusted multivariate analyses, cognitive status
remained an independent predictor of eGFR (β = 0.465; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mild-to-moderate CKD is highly pervasive among frail elderly
individuals and the severity of renal dysfunction is independently correlated
with that of cognitive impairment. Future studies are advocated to clarify
whether the combination of kidney and mental dysfunction may portend a higher
risk of worsen outcomes in this high-risk population.

A low-protein diet (LPD) can be expected to retard renal function decline in
advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including diabetic kidney
disease (DKD), and is recommended in a clinical setting. Regarding the molecular 
mechanisms of an LPD against DKD, previous animal studies have shown that an LPD 
exerts reno-protection through mainly the improvement of glomerular
hyperfiltration/hypertension due to the reduction of intraglomerular pressure. On
the other hand, we have demonstrated that an LPD, particularly a very-LPD (VLPD),
improved tubulo-interstitial damage, inflammation and fibrosis, through the
restoration of autophagy via the reduction of a mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in type 2 diabetes and obesity animal models. Thus,
based on animal studies, a VLPD may show a more beneficial effect against
advanced DKD. Previous clinical reports have also shown that a VLPD, not a
moderate LPD, slows the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with chronic
glomerular nephritis. However, there is insufficient clinical data regarding the 
beneficial effects of a VLPD against DKD. Additionally, the patients with CKD,
including DKD, are a high-risk group for malnutrition, such as protein⁻energy
wasting (PEW), sarcopenia, and frailty. Therefore, an LPD, including a VLPD,
should be prescribed to patients when the benefits of an LPD outweigh the risks, 
upon consideration of adherence, age, and nutritional status. As the future
predicts, the development of a VLPD replacement therapy without malnutrition may 
be expected for reno-protection against the advanced stages of DKD, through the
regulation of mTORC1 activity and adequate autophagy induction. However, further 
studies to elucidate detailed mechanisms by which a VLPD exerts reno-protection
are necessary.

Before the percutaneous era, the mortality rate of patients with coronary heart
disease not suitable for cardiac surgery was extremely high. This limit has been 
progressively exceeded with the advent of minimally invasive approaches, which,
although initially intended exclusively for low risk scenarios, was then employed
in complex patients often too compromised to undergo cardiac surgery. We are
currently witnessing, however, a sudden expansion in percutaneous coronary
interventions (PCI) in extreme cases, perceived as high-risk by operators,
imposing an important burden of human and economic resources on interventional
cardiology as a whole. In this review, the literature regarding the current
definition of high-risk PCI and its implications has been reviewed. In summary,
all proposed definitions of high risk PCI combine features related to three main 
clinical areas: 1) patient risk factors and comorbidities (incorporating those
which preclude surgical or percutaneous revascularization such as diabetes,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, lung disease,
frailty, advanced age); 2) location of the disease and complexity of coronary
anatomy (including multi-vessel disease, left main disease, chronic total
occlusion, bifurcations); 3) hemodynamic clinical status (ventricular
dysfunction, concomitant valvular disease or unstable characteristics).
Importantly, encouraging results in terms of efficacy and gains in health status 
of PCI in (variously defined) high-risk, as compared to the low-risks patients,
are reported. Thus, treating high-risk patients is becoming increasingly
relevant, to the point that current guidelines now particularly highlight the
appropriateness of percutaneous interventions in this setting .

Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of
diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, 
about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years.
Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive
impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly
more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial
disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a
consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a
considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without
any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with
type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into
account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life
expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals
and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically,
overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in
particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used
with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia
are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function
are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

Objectives The clinical condition of frailty is a common problem in the elderly
population. However, the relationship between peripheral artery disease and
frailty in hemodialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to
identify the relationships between peripheral artery disease and frailty in
Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods A total of 362 chronic
hemodialysis patients who regularly visited six institutions were enrolled. To
evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty phenotype adjusted for Japanese
were used. Peripheral artery disease was defined as ankle-brachial index <0.9.
Results Of 362 patients, 62 patients (17.1%) were categorized as peripheral
artery disease group and 300 patients (82.9%) as Non-peripheral artery disease
group. The prevalence of frailty in the peripheral artery disease group was
significantly higher than in the Non-peripheral artery disease group (34% vs.
18%, P = 0.0103). Non-shunt side grip strength was significantly stronger in the 
Non-peripheral artery disease group (23.6 kg vs. 17.0 kg, P < 0.0001). Thigh
circumferences were also significantly larger in the Non-peripheral artery
disease group (41.7 cm vs. 39.7 cm, P = 0.0054). A multivariate logistic
regression analysis demonstrated that the factors independently associated with
peripheral artery disease were as follows: frailty (odds ratio = 2.06, 95%
confidence interval 1.09-3.89) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 3.74, 95% 
confidence interval 2.05-6.83). Conclusions It is concluded that peripheral
artery disease is closely associated with frailty in hemodialysis patients.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcopenia and muscle weakness contribute to fragility and
limit exercise tolerance among patients with CKD. This review focuses on the role
of reduction in mitochondrial mass and function in the myopathy associated with
CKD, causes for these muscle mitochondrial abnormalities, and potential
therapeutic interventions that may improve mitochondrial biogenesis and function 
as well as skeletal muscle function and performance in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial structure, function, and
composition have been shown in both experimental models and patients with CKD. A 
significant reduction in mitochondrial respiratory function and an increase in
mitochondrial complex 1 enzyme activity has been demonstrated in the muscle
tissue of male Sprague-Dawley rats following 5/6 nephrectomy. These changes were 
associated with a substantial reduction in skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass. In
patients with CKD, in-vivo magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy show
significantly elevated resting skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and lower mean 
mitochondrial coupling ratio indicating disrupted muscle mitochondrial metabolism
and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Skeletal muscle biopsies from
patients with advanced CKD show lower mitochondrial volume density and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number than controls.
SUMMARY: Advanced CKD is associated with decreased exercise capacity, skeletal
muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. Impaired mitochondrial respiratory function,
reduced muscle mitochondrial mass, and decreased energy production in skeletal
muscle play a critical role in this 'acquired mitochondrial myopathy' of CKD. It 
is reasonable, therefore, to develop therapeutic interventions that enhance
mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as skeletal muscle function and
performance in patients with CKD.

Objective To determine the safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use
compared with warfarin use for the treatment of venous
thromboembolism.Design Retrospective matched cohort study conducted between 1
January 2009 and 31 March 2016.Setting Community based, using healthcare data
from six jurisdictions in Canada and the United States.Participants 59 525 adults
(12 489 DOAC users; 47 036 warfarin users) with a new diagnosis of venous
thromboembolism and a prescription for a DOAC or warfarin within 30 days of
diagnosis.Main outcome measures Outcomes included hospital admission or emergency
department visit for major bleeding and all cause mortality within 90 days after 
starting treatment. Propensity score matching and shared frailty models were used
to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of the outcomes comparing DOACs with warfarin.
Analyses were conducted independently at each site, with meta-analytical methods 
used to estimate pooled hazard ratios across sites.Results Of the 59 525
participants, 1967 (3.3%) had a major bleed and 1029 (1.7%) died over a mean
follow-up of 85.2 days. The risk of major bleeding was similar for DOAC compared 
with warfarin use (pooled hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to
1.03), with the overall direction of the association favouring DOAC use. No
difference was found in the risk of death (pooled hazard ratio 0.99, 0.84 to
1.16) for DOACs compared with warfarin use. There was no evidence of
heterogeneity across centres, between patients with and without chronic kidney
disease, across age groups, or between male and female patients.Conclusions In
this analysis of adults with incident venous thromboembolism, treatment with
DOACs, compared with warfarin, was not associated with an increased risk of major
bleeding or all cause mortality in the first 90 days of treatment.Trial
registration Clinical trials NCT02833987.

BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness is a risk factor for mortality in hemodialysis (HD)
patients. Muscle strength measurements are routinely used as a screening tool but
depend on patient cooperation and motivation. We wished to determine whether
measuring maximal voluntary muscle strength was affected by patient self-reported
distress.
METHODS: We measured pinch strength (PS) and handgrip strength (HGS) in 382 adult
HD patients with a corresponding self-reported distress thermometer (DT) scores. 
Postdialysis body composition measurements were made using multifrequency
bioelectrical assessments and patients assessed for frailty.
RESULTS: Mean age was 66.4 ± 14.9 years, with 238 males (62%), 48% diabetic, and 
dialysis vintage 36 (15-75) months. The mean DT score was 4.4 ± 3.3, with a
frailty score of 4.6 ± 1.5. On multivariable analysis, DT scores were associated 
with frailty (β = 0.35, P = .003), prescription of aspirin for cardiac disease (β
= 1.0, P = .004), lean body mass (β = 0.04, P = .004), and negatively with age (β
= -0.05, P < .001), hematocrit (β = -8.2, P = .004), and maximum PS (β = -1.4, P 
= .003).
CONCLUSION: Paradoxically higher self-reported DT scores were associated with
younger age and lean body mass. As such, younger healthier, rather than more
comorbid, patients may have greater expectations for their health and therefore
report more distress. We found no association between DT scores and HGS, and as
such, although HGS is a voluntary test, it appears to be a robust test
independent of patient stresses. However, PS was lower in patients with higher DT
scores, and as such, greater care may be required in interpreting these

OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia measured by decreased psoas muscle size has been used as a 
surrogate for frailty and correlates with adverse outcomes in both the short and 
long term after many major operations. Our aim was to evaluate this measure as a 
predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair 
(EVAR).
METHODS: Once Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, all patients who 
underwent EVAR from December 2010 to March 2016 at a Veterans Affairs hospital
were assessed for sarcopenia by total psoas muscle area (TPA) measured on axial
computed tomography scan immediately inferior to the fourth lumbar (L4) superior 
end plate. Outcomes including length of stay and mortality were collected from
the medical record.
RESULTS: There were 135 patients who underwent EVAR at a median age of 70 years. 
Median aneurysm size was 5.5 cm. Length of stay was >2 days in 25% of patients
(n = 33), with the most common reasons for delayed discharge including
respiratory complications (8.9% [n = 12]) and urinary retention (4.0% [n = 9]).
Low TPA was not associated with extended length of stay (P = .40). Patients with 
lowest tertile TPA had 42% 5-year survival compared with 93% survival observed
for the remaining two-thirds of patients (P = .01). Multivariate analysis
revealed increased likelihood of mortality at 5 years for patients in the lowest 
tertile for TPA (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.9) as well as
for patients with chronic kidney disease (odds ratio, 5.2; 95% confidence
interval, 1.5-18.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative sarcopenia does not appear to affect length of stay but
does portend worse long-term survival. This simple preoperative measurement may
help vascular surgeons tailor repair thresholds and avoid nonbeneficial
procedures.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

Renal disease is a common health condition that leads to loss of physical
function, frailty, and premature loss of independence in addition to other severe
comorbidities and increased mortality. Increased levels of physical activity and 
initiation of exercise training is recommended in the current guidelines for all 
patients with renal disease, but participation and adherence rates are low. The
barriers to exercise and physical activity in patients with renal disease are not
well defined and currently based on patient provider perception and opinion.
There have been no published reviews that have synthesized published findings on 
patient reported barriers to exercise. This integrative literature review
therefore aimed to identify the current understanding of patient reported
barriers to regular exercise. This integrative review found that patient
perceived barriers to exercise are not consistent with the barriers that have
been identified by renal disease specialists and healthcare providers, which were
disinterest, lack of motivation, and being incapable of exercise. The patient
reported barriers identified through this review were complex and diverse, and
the most frequently reported patient perceived barrier to exercise was low energy
levels and fatigue. It is clear that additional research to identify patient
perceived barriers to exercise is needed and that patient directed interventions 
to address these barriers should be developed. This integrative review provides
information to the interdisciplinary nephrology team that can be used to tailor
their assessment of barriers to exercise and provide exercise education for
patients with renal disease.

BACKGROUND: Predicting outcomes in those with chronic kidney disease or following
transplantation is challenging, and current models lack detailed patient-level
information. Frailty and poor functional status are risk factors for adverse
patient outcomes that may be useful additions to prognostic tools in patients
with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine 
whether frailty or functional status are associated with increased risk of
mortality or adverse clinical outcomes in patients with advanced kidney disease.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review to identify and evaluate
studies linking frailty and functional status with patient outcomes in
populations with advanced kidney disease. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, and the
Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials. Two reviewers will conduct all
screening and data extraction independently. A modified version of the Quality In
Prognosis Studies tool will be used to evaluate the quality of the studies. If
meta-analysis of outcome data is possible, a random effects model will be used.
DISCUSSION: The results of this review will inform the development, selection,
and validation of appropriate metrics needed to improve prognostication in
patients with chronic kidney disease.

INTRODUCTION: This article ponders upon wearable medical measurement devices in
relation to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its' associated comorbidities - and 
whether these might benefit CKD-patients. We aimed to map the intersection(s) of 
nephrology and wearable sensor technology to help technologists understand
medical aspects, and clinicians to understand technological possibilities that
are available (or soon will become so). Areas covered: A structured literature
search on main comorbidities and complications CKD patients suffer from, was used
to steer mini-reviews on wearable sensor technologies clustered around 3 themes
being: Cardiovascular-related, diabetes-related and physical fitness/frailty.
This review excludes wearable dialysis - although also strongly enabled by
miniaturization - because that highly important theme deserves separate in-depth 
reviewing. Expert commentary: Continuous progress in integrated electronics
miniaturization enormously lowered price, size, weight and energy consumption of 
electronic sensors, processing power, memory and wireless connectivity. These
combined factors boost opportunities for wearable medical sensors. Such devices
can be regarded as enablers for: Remote monitoring, influencing human behaviour
(exercise, dietary), enhanced home care, remote consults, patient education and
peer networks. However, to make wearable medical devices succeed, the challenge
to fit them into health care structures will be dominant over the challenge to
realize the bare technologies themselves.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and
associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in
frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we
examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of
Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in 
ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24
months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled
frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during
follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of
frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores
changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change,
0.2 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity
(0.6 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7
points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher
frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores
(-1.1 points per g/dl; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition,
patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become
frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction
in frailty score (95% confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the
underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included
serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of
hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and
hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at
any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic
rate was not independently associated with frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores,
with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of 
inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening
frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or 
posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered a model of accelerated aging. More
specifically, CKD leads to reduced physical functioning and increased frailty,
increased vascular dysfunction, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness,
high levels of systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased 
cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence suggests that the cognitive impairment 
associated with CKD may be related to cerebral small vessel disease and overall
impairment in white matter integrity. The triad of poor physical function,
vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment places patients living with CKD at
an increased risk for loss of independence, poor health-related quality of life, 
morbidity, and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the available 
evidence of cerebrovascular-renal axis and its interconnection with early and
accelerated cognitive impairment in patients with CKD and the plausible role of
exercise as a therapeutic modality. Understanding the cerebrovascular-renal axis 
pathophysiological link and its interconnection with physical function is
important for clinicians in order to minimize the risk of loss of independence
and improve quality of life in patients with CKD.

Background: The burden of chronic kidney disease is highest among older adults
but the significance of a diminished level of kidney function in this
heterogeneous population is poorly understood. We sought to examine the
relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and objective
physical performance in older adults.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 4,562 participants from The Irish
Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a national cohort of community-dwelling adults aged
≥50 years. We used multivariable linear or quantile regression to model the
association between categories of cystatin C (eGFRcys) or creatinine eGFR
(eGFRcr) and the following outcomes: gait speed, timed-up-and-go (TUG) and grip
strength. Relationships were further explored using natural eGFR splines. We
examined effect modification by age in the relationship between eGFR and gait
speed.
Results: Mean (SD) age was 61.8 (8.3) years, 53.6% were female and median (IQR)
eGFRcys was 82 (70-94) mL/min/1.73m2. In multivariable-adjusted models,
participants in the lowest eGFRcys category (< 45 mL/min/1.73m2) had 3.32 cm/s
(95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.02-6.62) slower mean gait speed, 1.32 kg
(95%CI 0.20-2.44) lower mean grip strength, and 0.31 seconds (95% CI -0.04 to
0.65) longer median TUG versus the reference group (eGFRcys ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2). 
The relationship between eGFRcys and outcomes appeared linear but varied by age. 
The association between eGFRcr and outcomes tended towards a U-shape.
Conclusions: Cystatin C eGFR was linearly related to poorer physical performance 
beyond middle age among community-dwelling adults. The non-linear relationships
observed with eGFRcr underscore the limitations of creatinine as a predictor of
frailty outcomes in older individuals.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review sarcopenia in chronic kidney
disease (CKD). We aim to present how definitions of sarcopenia from the general
population may pertain to those with CKD, its assessment by clinicians and
emerging therapies for sarcopenia in CKD. For this review, we limit our
description and recommendations to patients with CKD who are not on dialysis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Poorer parameters of lean mass, strength and physical function
are associated with worsening patient-centered outcomes such as limiting
mobility, falls and mortality in CKD; however, the magnitude of these
associations are different in those with and without CKD. Sarcopenia in CKD is a 
balance between skeletal muscle regeneration and catabolism, which are both
altered in the uremic environment. Multiple pathways are involved in these
derangements, which are briefly reviewed. Differences between commonly used terms
cachexia, frailty, protein-energy wasting, dynapenia and sarcopenia are
described. Therapeutic options in predialysis CKD are not well studied;
therefore, we review exercise options and emerging pharmacological therapies.
SUMMARY: Sarcopenia, now with its own International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision (ICD-10) code, is of importance clinically and should be accounted 
for in research studies in patients with CKD. Multiple therapies for sarcopenia
are in development and will hopefully be available for our patients in the
future.

BACKGROUND: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including 
adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key
consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures
of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with
complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013).
PREDICTORS: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated
using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine
albumin-creatinine ratio.
OUTCOME: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty
characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical
activity).
RESULTS: 341 (7%) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30%) had
eGFRcr<60mL/min/1.73m2, 2,480 (50%) had eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2, and 1,006 (20%) 
had albuminuria with albumin excretion ≥ 30mg/g. Among frail participants,
prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2 were 45% and 77%, respectively.
Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a 
strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals
with eGFRcr of 60 to <75mL/min/1.73m2 were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR 
categories using eGFRcys (49% to 45-<60, 32% to 30-<45, and 3%
to <30mL/min/1.73m2). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking ≥10 classes of medications) was
more common in frail individuals (54% vs 38% of nonfrail), including classes
requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent
complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants).
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, 
with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys
versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic
kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative
biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this
vulnerable population.

The scope of this article is to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors
associated with the frailty of elderly people with chronic kidney disease on
hemodialysis. This involved a correlational, cross-sectional study conducted in a
dialysis center in the state of São Paulo. The sample consisted of 60
participants. The Participant Characterization Instrument was used for extracting
sociodemographic and clinical data and the Edmonton Frail Scale was used to
evaluate the level of frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
identify the factors associated with frailty. The mean age of the 60 patients
included was 71.1 (± 6.9) years, predominantly male (70%), of which 36.7% were
classified as frail. With respect to the factors associated with frailty among
the variables of gender, age, self-reported skin color, schooling, monthly per
capita income, hemodialysis time, number of associated diseases, falls in the
year, hematocrit level, parathyroid hormone and use of calcitriol, it was found
that only the monthly per capita income was significantly associated with frailty
(OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.1-0.9; p = 0.04). There was an association between frailty
and income, showing that the elderly most at risk of frailty were those with
lower income.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older
adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive
impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of
life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in
increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in
hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients 
with pre-dialysis CKD.
METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385
patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated 
tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive
frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial.
Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of ≤24. We determined the
prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages 
G4-G5, not on dialysis.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5
had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control
group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most
pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function 
(p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of
stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment
in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects
of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of
cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes
deserves further study.

AIM: To investigate associations between clinical parameters - beyond the evident
physiological deterioration and limitations of medical treatment - with
in-hospital death for patients receiving Rapid Response System (RRS) attendances.
METHODS: Retrospective case-control analysis of clinical parameters for 328
patients aged 60 years and above at their last RRS call during admission to a
single teaching hospital in the 2012-2013 calendar years. Generalised estimating 
equation modelling was used to compare the deceased with a randomly selected
sample of those who had RRS calls and survived admission (controls), matched by
age group, sex, and hospital ward.
RESULTS: In addition to a pre-existing order for limitation of treatment or
cardiac arrest (OR 6.92; 95%CI 4.61-10.27), nursing home residence, proteinuria, 
advanced malignancy, acute myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease,
cognitive impairment and frailty were associated with high risk of death. After
adjusting for all the clinical indicators investigated, the strongest risk
factors for in-hospital death for patients with a RRS call were advanced
malignancy (OR 3.95; 95%CI 2.16-7.21) and new myocardial infarction (OR 2.79;
95%CI 1.86-4.20). Patients with cognitive impairment, frailty indicator or
chronic kidney disease were twice as likely to die as patients without those risk
factors.
CONCLUSION: In a sample of older deteriorated patients requiring a RRS
attendance, multiple indicators of chronic illness, cognitive impairment and
frailty were significantly associated with high risk of death. These clinical
features beyond the evident orders for limitation of medical treatment should
signal the need for clinicians to initiate end-of-life discussions that may
prevent futile interventions.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney
function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in
community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level,
and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0
(normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Frailty status
was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle
weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of
having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were more frail
(odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition,
individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or
hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of
frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. 
Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty 
in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI
1.13-14.1) CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a
higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Geriatr

Dysregulation of skeletal remodeling is a component of renal osteodystrophy.
Previously, we showed that activin receptor signaling is differentially affected 
in various tissues in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether a ligand
trap for the activin receptor type 2A (RAP-011) is an effective treatment of the 
osteodystrophy of the CKD-mineral bone disorder. With a 70% reduction in the
glomerular filtration rate, CKD was induced at 14 weeks of age in the ldlr-/-
high fat-fed mouse model of atherosclerotic vascular calcification and diabetes. 
Twenty mice with CKD, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated
activin A were treated with RAP-011, wherease 19 mice were given vehicle twice
weekly from week 22 until the mice were killed at 28 weeks of age. The animals
were then evaluated by skeletal histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography,
mechanical strength testing, and ex vivo bone cell culture. Results in the CKD
groups were compared with those of the 16 sham-operated ldlr-/- high fat-fed
mice. Sham-operated mice had low-turnover osteodystrophy and skeletal frailty.
CKD stimulated bone remodeling with significant increases in osteoclast and
osteoblast numbers and bone resorption. Compared with mice with CKD
and sham-operated mice, RAP-011 treatment eliminated the CKD-induced increase in 
these histomorphometric parameters and increased trabecular bone fraction.
RAP-011 significantly increased cortical bone area and thickness. Activin
A-enhanced osteoclastogenesis was mediated through p-Smad2 association with c-fos
and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Thus, an
ActRIIA ligand trap reversed CKD-stimulated bone remodeling, likely through
inhibition of activin-A induced osteoclastogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its
impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
is less defined.
METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 
trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three
groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR
≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were
analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors
of 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the
PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767
(30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 
(12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted
Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with
severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher
prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of
death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate
and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% 
in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild
RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus
none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other
significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass
index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction,
oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male
sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year
mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is
required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem that is associated
with excess morbidity, mortality, and health resource utilization. The
progression of CKD is defined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and
leads to a variety of metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypertension,
anemia, and mineral bone disorder. Lower glomerular filtration rate also bears a 
strong relationship with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, end-stage
renal disease, and death. Patterns of CKD progression include linear and
nonlinear trajectories, but kidney function can remain stable for years in some
individuals. Addressing modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD is
needed to attenuate its associated morbidity and mortality. Developing effective 
risk prediction models for CKD progression is critical to identify patients who
are more likely to benefit from interventions and more intensive monitoring.
Accurate risk-prediction algorithms permit systems to best align health care
resources with risk to maximize their effects and efficiency while guiding
overall decision making.

The recent epidemiologic data pointed out, that the general number of patients on
hemodialysis is steadily increasing, especially in group of elderly patients over
75 years old. The geriatric syndromes are a multietiological disorder related to 
physiological aging and partly associated with comorbid conditions. Frailty,
falls, functional decline and disability, cognitive impairment and depression are
main geriatric syndromes and occurs in patients with impaired renal function more
often than among general population. The causes of higher prevalence of those
syndromes are not well known, but uremic environment and overall renal
replacement therapy may have an important impact on its progress. The patient
with geriatric syndrome require comprehensive treatment as well as physical
rehabilitation, psychiatric cure and support in everyday activities. Herein below
we would like to review recent literature regarding to particular features of
main geriatric syndromes in a group of nephrological patients.

Antihypertensive treatment is aimed at reducing as much as possible health
outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. The main international guidelines
and clinical trials showed different positions about blood pressure targets. At
present, there is no common opinion about the benefits of an aggressive drug
treatment; moreover it is not clear whether lower blood pressure values are
related to increased morbidity and mortality. The recent randomized SPRINT trial 
has compared intensive vs standard drug therapy in a non-diabetic hypertensive
population. The trial has shown benefits of intensive treatment in reducing
important health outcomes, though results were not confirmed in several patient
subsets. We examined the studies on hypertensive patients with comorbidities
(i.e., chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) to identify blood pressure
targets recommended in these populations, but no strong evidence was found about 
the benefits of intensive treatment. In geriatric patients the "lower is better" 
paradigm cannot be entirely applied because of comorbidity, polypharmacy and
frailty.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

Skeletal muscle mass and muscle function are negatively affected by a variety of 
conditions inherent to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to dialysis treatment.
Skeletal muscle mass and function serve as indicators of the nutritional and
clinical state of CKD patients, and low values or derangements over time are
strong predictors of poor patient outcomes. However, muscle size and function can
be affected by different factors, may decline at different rates, and may have
different patient implications. Therefore, operational definitions of frailty and
sarcopenia have emerged to encompass these 2 dimensions of muscle health, i.e.,
size and functionality. The aim of this review is to appraise available methods
for assessment of muscle mass and functionality, with an emphasis on their
accuracy in the setting of CKD patients. We then discuss the selection of
reference cutoffs for defining conditions of muscle wasting and dysfunction.
Finally, we review definitions applied in studies addressing sarcopenia and
frailty in CKD patients and discuss their applicability for diagnosis and
monitoring.

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with
destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial
cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However,
surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis
rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on
hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal
kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree
decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior
instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to
adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical 
motion.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement
can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light
chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies
have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We
evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in
France.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered
in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 
with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored
for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as
renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and 
causes of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334
(23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72
years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was
observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation
was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis,
67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were 
malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and
cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty 
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high
BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is
poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of
death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

Stroke prevention in elderly atrial fibrillation patients remains a challenge.
There is a high risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism but also a high risk 
of bleeding if anticoagulants are prescribed. The elderly have increased chronic 
kidney disease, coronary artery disease, polypharmacy, and overall frailty. For
all these reasons, anticoagulant use is underutilized in the elderly. In this
manuscript, the benefits of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared
with warfarin in the elderly patient population with multiple comorbid conditions
are reviewed.

AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to 
complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and
functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total
number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and
assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD
0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified
Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P =
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good
construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the
potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for
patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

It is known that the common physiological denominator of the ageing process is an
attenuation of functional performance with respect to the situation of young
people and adults. However, since the first cohort-based longitudinal studies, it
has not been possible to establish a "linear" relationship between age and
glomerular filtration in all cases. This does not mean that there is no
physiological ageing process at all; in addition to those already elucidated, its
mechanisms include cell senescence, podocyte dysfunction, a vitamin D deficiency,
and homozygotic forms of the MYH9 gene. The aim of the present work was to
analyse the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and, where possible, the
correlation between CKD, defined by an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), plasma
25(OH)D3 levels and the MYH9 gene in a population of elderly and very elderly
persons. These parameters have not been evaluated previously in populations of
elderly and very elderly patients. It is concluded that a moderate decrease in
the eGFR occurs with age. This does not imply the presence of CKD in elderly
people, since in most individuals the reduced eGFR is not accompanied by anaemia,
and no individuals show hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia or a high Alb/Cr ratio.
Here we observed a lower Hb level and an elevated Alb/Cr ratio in subjects
heterozygotic for the MYH9 gene. This could be interpreted in the sense that the 
gene could exert some protective effect on renal function, whereas the
heterozygotic form (allele A) of the MYH9 gene could be considered a very early
marker, a new risk factor for the appearance of CKD, or a sign of renal frailty
in elderly people.

BACKGROUND: The elderly form an expanding proportion of patients with chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide. The increased physiological
frailty and functional morbidity associated with the aging process pose unique
challenges when planning optimal management of an older patient needing renal
replacement therapy (RRT).
AIMS: This position paper discusses current evidence regarding the optimal
management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly with an emphasis on
hemodialysis since it is the most common modality used in older patients. Further
research is needed to define relevant patient-reported outcome measures for
end-stage renal disease including functional assessments and psychological
impacts of various forms of RRT. For those older patients who have opted for
dialysis treatment, it is important to study the strategies that encourage
greater uptake of home-based dialysis therapies and optimal vascular access.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of advanced chronic kidney disease in the elderly can
be challenging but also extremely rewarding. The key issue is adopting a
patient-focused and individualized approach that seeks to achieve the best
outcomes based on a comprehensive holistic assessment of what is important to the
patient.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition 
with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more
frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other
chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in
pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an
outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was
modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was
used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed 
using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.
RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were
significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those 
who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of
frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was
significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower
physical and mental quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in
pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential
role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of
life.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

Body composition in chronic kidney disease.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Nephrology, University of California, San Francisco, California,
USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and
nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney
disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia
are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here.
RECENT FINDINGS: The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among
the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The
association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD 
stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely
associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger
associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy
supplementation combined with low-protein diet for the management of CKD may
prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but
dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis 
therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum
bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23 mEq/l for
nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A
benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven.
SUMMARY: Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and
integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing
comorbidities.

Multi-MitraClip therapy for severe degenerative mitral regurgitation: "anchor"
technique for extremely flail segments.

Center, Sacramento, California.

In high-risk or inoperable patients, implantation of MitraClip for treatment of
severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR) from central (A2/P2 pathology,
EVEREST patient) is effective in reducing symptoms and improving functional
class. Extending the use of MitraClip to the non-EVEREST patient is of
considerable interest. MitraClip implantation for wide flail segments and
non-central MR is technically more challenging but represents an important and
highly prevalent subset of patients. We present a case of an 82-year-old male
referred to our institution for medically refractory primary MR. Trans-esophageal
echocardiogram demonstrated severe (4+) MR, annular dilatation, P3 > P2 mitral
valve prolapse, malcoaptation, and wide flail gaps and widths. The patient's age,
frailty, chronic kidney disease, and mild cognitive impairment rendered him a
candidate for MitraClip therapy. Our target area, the areas of maximum flail
(A3/P3), proved too wide for grasping. Hence, the first clip was deployed medial 
to the target area. Subsequent deployment, in a sequential fashion ("zipper
technique"), was not technically feasible due to persistent instability of the
target area. Consideration was given to an alternative approach by "anchoring"
our target area where the 2nd and 3rd clips were deployed lateral to the A3/P3
segment in efforts to "anchor" the maximum flail segment. This maneuver allowed
final clip deployment into a more stable target area. Subsequent imaging
demonstrated reduction in MR from 4+ to 1+ with preservation of a normal
transmitral gradient. We report the first successful US case of four MitraClip
implantation for the treatment of severe primary MR by "anchoring" flail
segments.

Center, Baltimore VA Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in 
individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on 
their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of
cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that
highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid
conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating
cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including
microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally,
studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected
in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with
worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk
of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible
short-term effects on markers of physical performance.
SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to 
better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical
function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness
and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a
heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of
this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general
population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science,
CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD
and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text
review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. 
From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in
patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with
increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. 
In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher 
risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished
physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may 
lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to
understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with
clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated
risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly
associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and
frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established.
METHODS: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test
of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of
frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting
for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for
the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty
status.
RESULTS: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49
(36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of
participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for 
eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61
points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all
comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p
= 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated with worse frailty
status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).
CONCLUSIONS: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and
frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD
patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted
interventions.

Evidence has recently been building that the presence of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is an independent contributor to decline in physical and cognitive
functions in older adults. CKD affects 45% of persons older than 70 years of age 
and can double the risk for physical impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and
frailty. To increase awareness of this relatively new concept of CKD as a risk
factor for accelerated aging, we review studies on the association of CKD with
physical function, frailty, and cognitive function. We also present a summary of 
the proposed mechanisms for these associations.

Bone fracture risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher
than that in healthy subjects. Frailty caused by neuromuscular impairment as well
as bone fragility due to bone loss and impaired bone quality is thought to be
involved in the elevated fracture risk in CKD. Altered material and structural
properties might be attributed to the reduced bone strength. The structural
properties in CKD patients are characterized in 1) cortical thinning and cortical
porosity, and 2) irregular thickening and loss of connectivity in trabecular
bone. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that skeletal changes in the
structural properties may be initiated at earlier stage of CKD than we expected.

CKD is associated with impairments in health status, physical function, and
frailty. The aim of the current prospective cohort study was to determine whether
CKD predicted new LTCI need certification among community-dwelling older Japanese
adults. This was a prospective cohort study. We analyzed the cohort data from a
prospective study, The Japan Multicenter Aging Cohort for Care Prevention
(J-MACC). We followed 8063 elderly adults for 2 years, and we analyzed the
relationship between CKD and LTCI need. The outcome studied was new certification
for LTCI service need during a 2-year period. We measured serum creatinine (the
estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR), serum albumin, frailty checklist
scores, and body mass index. During the 2-year follow-up, 536 subjects (6.6%)
were newly certified as needing LTCI services. We stratified the cohort according
to eGFR quartile and performed multivariate analyses using an eGFR value of
71.4-83.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) as a reference. We found that subjects with eGFR
values <60.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) had a significantly elevated risk of LTCI service
need (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.44 [95% CI 1.12-1.86]). Our results indicate that 
CKD is independently associated with new LTCI service need certification and is
an important marker of frailty in older adults.

Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of
Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and
catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate
with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and
provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of
PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology
of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition)
due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent 
factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include
uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent
inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of
hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition,
comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the
dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor is
recommended for use as first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary
syndromes (ACS) who undergo high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention.
However, revascularization may not be a beneficial option for some subgroups of
patients with ACS. This includes a broad spectrum of lower risk patients as well 
as high-risk patients with numerous previous revascularizations and those who are
at high risk for complications, such as those with complex coronary anatomy and
co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or advanced age
and frailty. For such patients, there remains an unmet need for evaluation of
alternatives to the currently recommended treatment options. Notably, there is a 
paucity of prospective data regarding management approaches to medically managed 
patients with ACS. Thus, this group of medically managed patients with ACS would 
benefit from inclusion in clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for
patients not scheduled to undergo invasive procedures, such as those who are
targeted for pharmacologic management only. In conclusion, in this review, the
investigators revisit data from clinical studies of dual-antiplatelet therapy in 
ACS to highlight areas of unmet need in antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS
and to examine the use of newer agents in subgroups, such as medically managed
patients with ACS, that would potentially benefit from more potent platelet
inhibition after ACS.

BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be
associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Given the high
prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD in the general population, in depth analysis
of this association is warranted.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We pooled individual participant data from 5 community-based
cohorts from Europe (second Nord-Trøndelag Health Study [HUNT2], Prevention of
Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease [PREVEND], and the Tromsø study) and the
United States (Atherosclerosis Risks in Communities [ARIC] and Cardiovascular
Health Study [CHS]) to assess the association of estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and CKD with objectively verified VTE. To estimate
adjusted hazard ratios for VTE, categorical and continuous spline models were fit
by using Cox regression with shared-frailty or random-effect meta-analysis. A
total of 1178 VTE events occurred over 599 453 person-years follow-up. Relative
to eGFR 100 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), hazard ratios for VTE were 1.29 (95% confidence
interval, 1.04-1.59) for eGFR 75, 1.31 (1.00-1.71) for eGFR 60, 1.82 (1.27-2.60) 
for eGFR 45, and 1.95 (1.26-3.01) for eGFR 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). In comparison
with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 5.0 mg/g, the hazard ratios for VTE 
were 1.34 (1.04-1.72) for ACR 30 mg/g, 1.60 (1.08-2.36) for ACR 300 mg/g, and
1.92 (1.19-3.09) for ACR 1000 mg/g. There was no interaction between clinical
categories of eGFR and ACR (P=0.20). The adjusted hazard ratio for CKD, defined
as eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or albuminuria ≥30 mg/g, (versus no CKD) was
1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.06). Associations were consistent in
subgroups according to age, sex, and comorbidities, and for unprovoked versus
provoked VTE, as well.
CONCLUSIONS: Both eGFR and ACR are independently associated with increased risk
of VTE in the general population, even across the normal eGFR and ACR ranges.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a physiological vulnerability status of the patient
which is associated with the increased number of hospitalization and death.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of frailty and its associated factors in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on conservative treatment (CT),
hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).
METHODS: Frailty was assessed in 146 patients (86 CT, 37 HD and 23 PD) and
characterized as muscle weakness and exhaustion--by the physical aspect and
vitality domains, respectively, evaluated in the SF-36 quality of life
instrument; physical inactivity--if he or she answered "never" or "hardly ever"
when asked about physical activity; and as unintentional weight loss (> 4.5 kg
per year). Patients were divided into three groups: non-fragile (NF), pre-fragile
(PF) and fragile (F). The demographic, clinical and laboratory data were
extracted from patient charts.
RESULTS: Frailty was diagnosed in 36% of patients on CT, 37.8% in HD and 47.8% in
PD. It was characterized in 36.8% of patients aged between 20 and 40 years and
40.3% of those between 41 and 60 years. Frailty was significantly associated with
the use of vitamin D (r = 0.16; p = 0.03), hemoglobin (r = -0.14; p = - 0.02) and
intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.16; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is common among patients with CKD on conservative treatment 
and dialysis, even in those who are not elderly. In the patients studied, the
phenotype of frailty was associated with no usage of vitamin D, lower serum
levels of hemoglobin and higher levels of parathyroid hormone.

Thyroid hormone abnormalities and frailty in elderly patients with chronic kidney
disease: a hypothesis.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults,
affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are
encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap
with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder 
may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded
in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed 
to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is
being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization
and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low
testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of
whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly
CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In
this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone
abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with
CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors 
predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and
treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
importance.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the acute and late outcomes
of a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) program including both the
transfemoral (TF) and transapical (TA) approaches; and 2) to determine the
results of TAVI in patients deemed inoperable because of either porcelain aorta
or frailty.
BACKGROUND: Very few data exist on the results of a comprehensive TAVI program
including both TA and TF approaches for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis
in patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with the Edwards valve (Edwards 
Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, California) between January 2005 and June 2009 in 6
Canadian centers were included.
RESULTS: A total of 345 procedures (TF: 168, TA: 177) were performed in 339
patients. The predicted surgical mortality (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk
score) was 9.8 +/- 6.4%. The procedural success rate was 93.3%, and 30-day
mortality was 10.4% (TF: 9.5%, TA: 11.3%). After a median follow-up of 8 months
(25th to 75th interquartile range: 3 to 14 months) the mortality rate was 22.1%. 
The predictors of cumulative late mortality were peri-procedural sepsis (hazard
ratio [HR]: 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48 to 8.28) or need for
hemodynamic support (HR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.11 to 6), pulmonary hypertension (PH)
(HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR: 2.30, 95% CI:
1.38 to 3.84), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 1.75, 95%
CI: 1.09 to 2.83). Patients with either porcelain aorta (18%) or frailty (25%)
exhibited acute outcomes similar to the rest of the study population, and
porcelain aorta patients tended to have a better survival rate at 1-year
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: A TAVI program including both TF and TA approaches was associated
with comparable mortality as predicted by surgical risk calculators for the
treatment of patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk, including
porcelain aorta and frail patients. Baseline (PH, COPD, CKD) and peri-procedural 
(hemodynamic support, sepsis) factors but not the approach determined worse
outcomes.

Health-related quality of life outcomes in chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

Older adults (aged >or=65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD
population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging.
Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the
frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among
vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical 
performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death.
Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits 
seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a
highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the
trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed 
to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to
identify opportunities to intervene.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney
disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated
criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to 
determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were
associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the
association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly
increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for
the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds 
of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation,
vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and
chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney
disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.
Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection
remain elusive.

Dedicated European and US clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes in the elderly 
have been released, but they do not specifically address the issue of advanced
chronic kidney disease (CKD) in older patients with diabetes. General clinical
guidelines have been published on the treatment of patients with diabetic
nephropathy (DN), but these address the issue of how to prevent progression and
treat advanced DN without distinguishing between different age groups. Elderly
patients with diabetes and stages 3 to 4 CKD have particular needs that differ
from those of younger patients with the same conditions. This is mainly due to
their frailty and shorter life expectancy. Differently tailored therapeutic
strategies are needed, which may have less stringent targets; and the use of
common drugs should be critically evaluated. The management agenda (metabolic
control, low-protein diet, controlling BP, preventing progression of advanced DN,
preventing cardiovascular outcomes) for these patients is discussed in light of
the limits and perspectives of current guidelines. Intensive, simultaneous
management of all items on the agenda may not be feasible for a proportion of
older patients, and clinicians may have to give priority to reducing some risk
factors rather than others, choosing between different therapies.

New advances in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) change the
perspective from which many of its features and treatment are viewed. Calcium,
phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D have been shown to be
important determinants of survival associated with kidney diseases. Now ROD
dependent and independent of these factors is linked to survival more than just
skeletal frailty. This review focuses on recent discoveries that renal injury
impairs skeletal anabolism decreasing the osteoblast compartment of the skeleton 
and consequent bone formation. This discovery and the discovery that PTH
regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche alters our view of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) from that of a disease to
that of a necessary adaptation to renal injury that goes awry. Furthermore, ROD
is shown to be an underappreciated factor in the level of the serum phosphorus in
CKD. The discovery and the elucidation of the mechanism of hyperphosphatemia as a
cardiovascular risk in CKD change the view of ROD. It is now recognized as more
than a skeletal disorder, it is an important component of the mortality of CKD
that can be treated.

This study investigated mortality in 568 individuals from the Goessel Mennonite
community in rural central Kansas. There were three main objectives to this
research: 1) characterize mortality trends within a biologically well-defined
Mennonite community; 2) determine what biochemical, morphological, and
physiological risk factors could be related to all-cause mortality, stratified by
age and sex; and 3) compare these results to previously described variables that 
were associated with both biological age and mortality in this population.
Mortality data were obtained from three sources: Kansas Vital Records, the Social
Security death index, and church records. In total, 221 (39%) individuals were
found to have died in this population between January 1980-June 2002. Analogous
to the larger US population, the three leading causes of death in this community 
were heart disease, cancer, and stroke, accounting for 60% of all deaths. Besides
advancing age, the greatest biological risk factor in this population was
decreased amounts of albumin in men (relative risk, 2.47), potentially indicating
underreported cases of either chronic kidney disease or frailty syndrome for
males. Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated that increased amounts of
total cholesterol may provide a protective effect for elderly individuals. We
conclude, based on the previously described heritability of both albumin (h(2) = 
0.40) and total cholesterol (h(2) = 0.50) in this population, that underlying
genetic factors associated with both chronic degenerative diseases and biological
aging may have important implications for understanding mortality patterns in
this community.
