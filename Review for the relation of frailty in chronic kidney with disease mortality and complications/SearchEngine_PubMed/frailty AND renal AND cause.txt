The aortic valve is a semilunar valve with three leaflets, which lies at the
junction of left ventricle and aorta. It allows unidirectional blood flow from
the left ventricle to the aorta and the rest of the body. Because of the highly
complex and sophisticated cellular and molecular functions, the thin valve
leaflet can withstand extreme mechanical and hemodynamic forces with every
cardiac cycle.[1] Various factors including age and congenital defects can
compromise the normal valvular function leading to a wide variety of
complications.[2] Although bicuspid aortic valves (BAV) are the most common
congenital abnormality, congenital valve defects can range from aortic atresia
(missing or incomplete closure of aortic valves) to a sub or supra-valvular
stenosis. BAV is reported to have an incidence of 1 to 2% with a male
predominance. Lack of microfibrillar proteins during valvulogenesis has been
reported to affect the leaflet development where two leaflets are fused to form
one large leaflet. It frequently correlates with aortic abnormalities such as
aortic dilation (root, ascending and arch) and coarctation of the aorta.[3] The
bicuspid aortic valve leaflets can undergo accelerated calcific degeneration
because of abnormal hemodynamic forces. Congenital abnormalities including BAV
can lead to various valvular complications including aortic stenosis and aortic
regurgitation leading to an increased risk to infective endocarditis, which has a
reported incidence of 12 to 39% in BAV.[3] Unless severe, BAV generally remains
asymptomatic till the age of 50 to 60 years. Aortic stenosis (AS) is a narrowing 
of the valve aperture reducing the aortic valve area. Increased resistance to
blood flow and transvalvular pressure gradient causes increased left ventricle
workload causing hypertrophy. Its prevalence increases with age and can be as
high as 4.6% in people greater than age 75 years. Being the most common valvular 
disease in Europe and America, estimates are that 3.5 million people in England
alone will have AS by the year 2020.[4] Calcific degeneration leading to
stiffening and restriction motion of valve leaflet is the most common cause of
AS. Disruption of endothelium lining on the aortic side caused by increased
mechanical stress seem to be the inciting event. Posterior leaflets are
reported to be affected the most.[5] Rheumatic fever causing inflammation of the 
leaflets is still the leading cause of AS in developing countries. AS can be
asymptomatic or can cause symptoms of syncope, angina and heart
failure.[6] Severe AS is fatal with a 50% mortality at 2 years.[7] As per The
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines,
AS is graded severe when the orifice area is less than 1.0 cm, the mean gradient 
is greater than 40 mmHg or the jet velocity is greater than 4 m/s. Prognosis is
poor in symptomatic or severe cases unless the valve is replaced. Up to 30% of
patients aged > 75 do not undergo surgical valve replacement either because of
technical reasons; this may include porcelain aorta, general frailty, refusal to 
undergo surgery, and serious comorbid conditions.[8] The operative death risk for
surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is as high as 10% in patients with LV
dysfunction, chronic renal disease, and advanced age.[9] Trans-catheter aortic
valve replacement and trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVR/TAVI) have
emerged as a more feasible and less risky option for patients not suitable for
surgery. Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the backflow of blood from the aorta to the
left ventricle when the valve leaflets fail to coapt. Common causes include
congenital defects, calcific degeneration, infective endocarditis, rheumatic
fever, and trauma.[10][11][12][13] Ventricular hypertrophy in chronic cases
accommodates increased volume to maintain the normal stroke volume and
end-diastolic pressure; hence, chronic AR can be asymptomatic for decades.[14] In
contrast, with acute cases of AR, ventricles do not have enough time to undergo
the needed changes such as hypertrophy to accommodate increased volumes. Because 
of decreased stroke volume, the heart rate increases to maintain cardiac output
but is insufficient to meet the demand resulting in increased left atrial
pressure, pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. On physical examination, AR
murmur is blowing, high-pitched, diastolic, and decrescendo, beginning soon after
the aortic component of S (A); it is loudest at the 3rd or 4th left parasternal
intercostal space. It also has associations with various other murmurs including:
“Mid-systolic murmur” because of rapid ejection of an overload of blood from the 
left ventricle, “Austin Flint” murmur is mid-to-late diastolic murmur due
to partial closure of mitral valve during ventricular systole because of
regurgitant flow from aortic valve, “Cole-Cecil” is a diastolic murmur due to the
fusion of an aortic murmur with the S3 because of simultaneous filling of the
left ventricle from left atrium and AR. History of valvular surgery Dr. Theodore 
Tuffier, in 1912, used his finger to free the fused leaflets of a stenosed aortic
valve.[15] Before the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), mitral valve repair
involved commissurotomy through access from the left atrial chamber. Thomas Homes
Sellors performed first pulmonary valvulotomy in 1948 by using a tenotomy
knife.[16] Charles Hufnagel developed the first artificial valve based on a
reciprocating ball and cage. It was used to prevent backflow of blood into the
ventricles due to aortic insufficiency.[17] CPB machine revolutionized the valve 
replacement in the anatomical position. Dr. Dwight Harken and his colleagues
performed the first successful aortic valve replacement. Later that year, Drs.
Albert Starr and Lowell Edwards performed mitral valve replacement.[18]
Bioprosthetic valves are closer in function to natural valves but have a limited 
life expectancy, whereas, Mechanical valves are more durable but require
anticoagulation. The choice of valves, among other factors, depends upon the
patient’s age and well-being. Mechanical heart valves are known to last for
approximately 25 years. Seventy different mechanical heart valves have been
developed since 1960.[19] Ball and cage, bi-leaflet, and tilting disc are the
common ones. Modification of the ball valve by Dr. Albert Starr and Lowell
Edwards entailed developing a cage made of lucite with a silicone elastomer ball.
The cage material was later changed to stainless steel and then cobalt-chromium
alloys. The Starr-Edward valve also has a Teflon sewing ring, which enabled
suturing into mitral and later into the aortic position.[20]  Increased
thrombogenicity has been a significant issue, for which valves underwent several 
modifications such as measures to reduce metal contact by covering the struts
with cloth and using Silastic shields. Other issues included hemolysis due to
excessive rubbing of the ball against the sewing ring and occlusion of coronary
ostia because of high profile. Despite these issues, these valves showed the
feasibility of prosthetic valve enabling Starr-Edwards to draw design criteria.
Basic points included that the valves should be chemically inert, biocompatible, 
a-traumatic to blood, and non-thrombogenic.[21]  In 1965, Kay-Shiley’s
non-rotating disc valve replaced the ball with a single disc but demonstrated
poor hemodynamics and hemolysis and was discontinued. Bjork-Shiley in 1969
developed a tilting-disc valve, which overcame the problems with the single-disc 
valve. Free rotation of disc between metal struts allows it to open by tilting at
a 60-degree angle. Bjork-Shiley replaced the flat with the convexo-concave disc
to create a larger orifice in 1975 but were the object of a recall due to
fracture of welded struts.[22]  Medtronic Hall valve developed by Dr. Karl Hall
and Robert Kaster is the most common tilting disc valve. Perforation in the
middle of the disc served as a guide and an improved tilting angle.[23] In 1977, 
St Jude Medical developed Bi-leaflet valve, which comprised two semi-circular
flaps with hinges close to the center of the orifice. Stagnation of blood flow
leading to thrombus formation around the hinge region was a problem with the
bi-leaflet valve.[15] A newly developed valve resolved this issue with a valve in
which the continuous 360-degree rotation around the central axis of the valve
ensured an even distribution of blood flow and prevent thrombus formation.[16] 
Predisposition for thrombosis, embolism, need for lifelong anticoagulation
therapy are drawbacks of mechanical valves. Bioprosthetic valves can either be an
allograft (cadaver or Ross procedure) or, a xenograft (native or pericardium).
The Ross procedure involves replacing the diseased aortic valve with the
patient’s own pulmonary valve (autograft) and replace the pulmonary valve with
aortic or pulmonary allograft. The pulmonary autograft grows with the patient and
does not induce an immunologic response. The most common xenografts are porcine
aortic valves and bovine pericardial valves. Lonescu-Shiley developed xenograft
valves by using bovine pericardium on a titanium stent in 1971 but was later
withdrawn in 1987 due to structural failure including abrasive tears because of
fabric-tissue interface and leaflet calcification. Carpentier-Edwards bovine
pericardial valve overcame those issues by making some structural modifications, 
like stitching pericardium to the inside of the fabric and using flexible stent
posts. Although biological valves have better hemodynamics compared to mechanical
valves, they have a shorter lifespan because of calcification, which stiffens the
valve leaflets. Tissues engineering, a field in regenerative medicine restores
and maintains the function of living tissues. Skin graft for burn victims is an
example. Tissue engineered heart valves (TEHV) are perceived to be
non-thrombogenic, and infection resistant. With advancement in material science
and culturing techniques, there is the possibility of a TEHV valve that
is capable of growing, remodeling and repairing itself as the patients grow.
Polymeric valves have been around for over 50 years, but because the earlier
versions were prone to calcification and degradation, they were not widely used
and instead only used in bridge devices like artificial hearts and left
ventricular assist devices. Besides the advantage that they can be produced in
various shapes and sizes,[17] they are known to combine the durability of
mechanical valves and the hydrodynamic function of bioprosthetic valves.[18] The 
earliest polymeric valve implanted in a 44-year-old female in 1958 at the mitral 
position was a polyurethane design with Teflon chordae
tendinae.[18][18][24] Polyurethane valves have been found to have better
hemodynamics compared to bioprosthetic valves and a lower incidence of
thrombogenicity than mechanical valves. With advances in material sciences, the
future of polymeric valves seems promising.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fluid overload and intradialytic hypotension are
associated with cardiovascular events and mortality in patients on hemodialysis. 
We investigated associations between hemodialysis facility practices related to
fluid volume and intradialytic hypotension and patient outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Data were analyzed from 10,250
patients in 273 facilities across 12 countries, from phase 4 of the Dialysis
Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS; 2009-2012). Cox regression models
(shared frailty) were used to estimate associations between facility practices
reported by medical directors in response to the DOPPS Medical Directors Survey
and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization, and
cardiovascular events, adjusting for country, age, sex, dialysis vintage,
predialysis systolic BP, cardiovascular comorbidities, diabetes, body mass index,
smoking, residual kidney function, dialysis adequacy, and vascular access type.
RESULTS: Of ten facility practices tested (chosen a priori), having a protocol
that specifies how often to assess dry weight in most patients was associated
with lower all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 99% confidence interval [99% CI], 
0.64 to 0.94) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.72; 99% CI, 0.55 to 0.95).
Routine orthostatic BP measurement to assess dry weight was associated with lower
all-cause hospitalization (HR, 0.86; 99% CI, 0.77 to 0.97) and cardiovascular
events (HR, 0.85; 99% CI, 0.73 to 0.98). Routine use of lower dialysate
temperature to limit or prevent intradialytic hypotension was associated with
lower cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.76; 99% CI, 0.58 to 0.98). Routine use of
an online volume indicator to assess dry weight was associated with higher
all-cause hospitalization (HR, 1.19; 99% CI, 1.02 to 1.38). Routine use of sodium
modeling/profiling to limit or prevent intradialytic hypotension was associated
with higher all-cause mortality (HR, 1.36; 99% CI, 1.14 to 1.63), cardiovascular 
mortality (HR, 1.34; 99% CI, 1.04 to 1.73), and cardiovascular events (HR, 1.21; 
99% CI, 1.03 to 1.43).
CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis facility practices relating to the management of fluid 
volume and intradialytic hypotension are associated with patient outcomes.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 2% to 4% of patients with
severe aortic stenosis. It is because these patients have been excluded from
clinical trials, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in 
this patient group has not been thoroughly investigated. Between April 2008 and
March 2015, 2,000 patients (dialysis group, n = 56 [2.8%]) were consecutively
enrolled when diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and eligible to undergo TAVI.
Procedural and longer-term outcomes were analyzed and adjusted for differences in
baseline characteristics. Patients on dialysis had a higher periprocedural
mortality (10.7% vs 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 5.65, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.91 to 16.67; p = 0.002) and a lower Valve Academic Research
Consortium (VARC)-II (VARC) defined device success (adjOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to
0.79; p = 0.012). At 30 days, there was an increased rate of all-cause mortality 
(21.4 vs 4.8%; adjOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.96 to 12.26; p = 0.001), cardiovascular
(adjOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.41; p = 0.007) and noncardiovascular mortality
(adjOR 6.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 9.41; p = 0.019), myocardial infarction (adjOR 9.39, 
95% CI 1.84 to 48.03; p = 0.007), bleeding (adjOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.83;
p = 0.036) as well as the VARC-II defined early safety combined end point (adjOR 
2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.90; p = 0.012) associated with dialysis. Dialysis was
associated with poor survival at one (57.1% vs 84.2%) and 3 years (26.8% vs
66.9%) with or without the consideration of the first 72 hours (p <0.001;
adjusted p <0.001). Although, in the multivariable regression analysis, reduced
ejection fraction, peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH),
frailty and dialysis were associated with 1-year mortality, only PH (>60 mm Hg)
remained significant in an analysis restricted to the dialysis patients (adjusted
hazard ratio 2.68; 95% CI 1.18 to 5.88; p = 0.018). PH had a sensitivity of
45.8%, a specificity of 81.3%, and a positive predictive value of 64.7%. In
conclusion, dialysis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who
underwent TAVI. Long-term mortality in dialysis patients appears to be largely
determined by the kidney disease and/or dialysis itself whereas VARC-II defined
complications are largely unaffected. An increased short-term mortality still
calls for (pre-) procedural optimization.

AIM: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been
diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty,
but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with
frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study
to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic
hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited.
Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered
diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not
(Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the
prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined
the risk factors for frailty.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than 
that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the
association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients
(n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their
interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic
nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic
nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18:
1597-1602.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients are underrepresented in the studies concerning
anticoagulation therapy (AT) in atrial fibrillation (AF), while patients' frailty
status is lacking in most of the studies.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate AT in AF elderly patients and study the 
effect of patients' frailty status on their long-term AT.
METHODS: We conducted an observational prospective study that enrolled
consecutive AF patients (≥ 75 years) who were hospitalized in the Department of
Internal Medicine of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, Greece from 1
June 2015 to 1 June 2016. We recorded the AT on admission and at discharge,
all-cause mortality, and hospital readmission in a follow-up period of 1 year
after hospital discharge. Frailty status was assessed by pre-established scores.
RESULTS: One hundred and four consecutive patients (49% male; median age
87 years) were enrolled, 78 (78.8%) of whom received AT at discharge. Patients
who did not receive AT at discharge had a higher HEMORR2HAGES (Hepatic or renal
disease, Ethanol abuse, Malignancy, Older age, Reduced platelet count or
function, Re-bleeding, Hypertension, Anemia, Genetic factors, Excessive fall risk
and Stroke) score (5.5 ± 1.15 vs. 4.79 ± 1.68; p = 0.032), a lower Katz score
(2.48 ± 2.23 vs. 4.08 ± 2.25; p = 0.006), and a higher Clinical Frailty Scale
score (7 ± 1.95 vs. 5.57 ± 2.05; p = 0.006). Sixty-five patients (62.5%) were
readmitted to a hospital during the follow-up period. In-hospital death occurred 
in five patients (4.8%) and 57 patients (57.6%) died within the follow-up period.
CONCLUSION: A high percentage of the elderly AF patients did not receive AT, even
at discharge. Patients who did not receive AT at discharge had higher bleeding
and frailty scores. In the 1-year follow-up period after hospital discharge, high
all-cause mortality and a high number of hospital readmissions were recorded.

INTRODUCTION: Early toxic death (≤60 days of diagnosis) in elderly multiple
myeloma (MM) patients is attributable to active disease, age and co-morbidities. 
Rate of early toxic deaths is 10% with conventional chemotherapy mainly due to
infection and renal failure. Novel agents have improved MM outcome at the expense
of newer toxicity.
METHODS: We analyzed 1146 individual patient data to assess toxic deaths during
induction treatment with first-generation novel agents thalidomide, lenalidomide,
bortezomib.
RESULTS: During first-line therapy, 119/1146 patients (10%) died for any cause,
and 47/1146 (4%) due to toxicity, including 12/1146 (1%) early deaths. The
24-month cumulative incidence was 4.1% without any difference between bortezomib 
(18/503 patients, 4%) and lenalidomide (29/643patients, 5%; p = 0.31). Toxic
deaths occurred in 34/1039 (3%) patients <80 years and 13/107 (12%) patients ≥80 
years. Causes were cardiac events (28%), infections (26%) and vascular
complications (15%). In a multivariate analysis, older age and unfavorable ISS
stage increased the risk of death.
CONCLUSION: First-generation novel agents significantly reduced toxic deaths
compared to conventional chemotherapy. One third of deaths during first-line
therapy were due to cumulative drug-related toxicities, thus supportive
approaches and prevention strategies should be optimized. The higher mortality
rate for toxicity in octogenarians confirms the need for a careful frailty
assessment.

OBJECTIVES: Frailty can cause increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes,
such as falls, fractures, depression and reduced health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition,
HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care
utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 
2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5).
METHODS: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney
disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up
study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale);
depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and
cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools.
Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights >136 kg, and coinciding
comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded.
RESULTS: Frailty occurred in 17% of participants (n=7). Frail participants had
lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more 
depression (p=<0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and
emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p<0.05). No differences in
health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail
participants (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney
disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater
depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.

BACKGROUND: The predictive ability of patient frailty on clinical outcomes after 
revascularization in patients with critical limb ischemia remains largely
unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 643 patients with critical limb ischemia treated
with endovascular therapy (N=486) or bypass surgery (N=157) in January 2010 to
January 2016, and prospectively assessed them using a 9-level clinical frailty
scale (CFS). Patients were divided into 3 groups according to CFS levels: low
(CFS level, 1-3; N=234), intermediate (CFS level, 4-6; N=196), and high (CFS
level, 7-9; N=213) groups. Clinical follow-up rate was 95.8% at 2 years. In the
low, intermediate, and high CFS groups, 2-year overall survival rates were 80.5%,
63.1%, and 49.3% (P<0.001) and amputation-free survival rates were 77.9%, 60.5%, 
and 46.2% (P<0.001), respectively. In multivariable analysis, higher frailty was 
independently associated with all-cause death (intermediate CFS group: adjusted
hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.42; P=0.01; high CFS group:
adjusted hazard ratio, 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.52-3.23; P<0.001) and a
composite of all-cause death and major amputation (intermediate CFS group:
adjusted hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.48; P=0.004; high
CFS group: adjusted hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.64-3.35;
P<0.001). Frailty was also independently associated with overall survival and
amputation-free survival in patients aged ≤75 and >75 years, those who underwent 
endovascular therapy or bypass surgery, and those with or without chronic renal
failure, without significant interactions.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was independently associated with 2-year overall survival
and amputation-free survival in patients with critical limb ischemia treated with
revascularization, irrespective of age, revascularization mode, and chronic renal
failure status.

PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: In clinical practice, older patients are often
undertreated due to underrepresentation in clinical trials and fear of toxicity. 
Our objective was therefore to review toxicities that are specific to older
cancer patients, to review risk factors in order to help physicians guide their
decisions, and to review interventions that can be implemented in routine
clinical practice to prevent toxicity induced by cancer therapies.
RECENT FINDINGS: On the whole, reviews report similar number and frequency as
well as similar grade 3 or 4 adverse events between subjects older and younger
than 65 years. Yet patients included in clinical trials are often not
representative of real-life patients and are often fit older cancer patients.
Moreover, tolerance to the additive impact of multiple adverse effects is
different between older and younger patients. And specific symptoms such as
stomatitis may cause a series of consequences such as dehydration, denutrition,
renal insufficiency, and adverse events of renally excreted drugs. Older patients
are at high risk of toxicity due to many factors but mainly due to the prevalence
of frailty in this population that has been estimated to be around 40% increasing
the risk of chemotherapy intolerance. As a consequence, interventions must be
implemented according to altered domains of comprehensive geriatric assessment in
order to improve anticancer tolerance. These interventions are reviewed here.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

INTRODUCTION: Advances in modern medicine have led to people living longer and
healthier lives. Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored as
a risk factor in cardiac surgery. When it comes to CABG surgery, randomized
controlled clinical trials have primarily focused on low-risk (ROOBY, CORONARY), 
elevated-risk (GOPCABE) or high-risk patients (BBS), but not on frail patients.
Therefore, we believe that off-pump CABG could be an important technique in
patients with limited functional capacity to respond to surgical stress. In this 
study, the authors introduce the new national, multicenter, randomized,
controlled trial "FRAGILE", to be developed in the main cardiac surgery centers
of Brazil, to clarify the potential benefit of off-pump CABG in frail patients.
METHODS: FRAGILE is a two-arm, parallel-group, multicentre, individually
randomized (1:1) controlled trial which will enroll 630 patients with blinded
outcome assessment (at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years), which
aims to compare adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events after off-pump versus 
on-pump CABG in pre-frail and frail patients. Primary outcomes will be all-cause 
mortality, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with successful
resuscitation, low cardiac output syndrome/cardiogenic shock, stroke, and
coronary reintervention. Secondary outcomes will be major adverse cardiac and
cerebrovascular events, operative time, mechanical ventilation time, hyperdynamic
shock, new onset of atrial fibrillation, renal replacement therapy, reoperation
for bleeding, pneumonia, length of stay in intensive care unit, length of stay in
hospital, number of units of blood transfused, graft patency, rate of complete
revascularization, neurobehavioral outcomes after cardiac surgery, quality of
life after cardiac surgery and costs.
DISCUSSION: FRAGILE trial will determine whether off-pump CABG is superior to
conventional on-pump CABG in the surgical treatment of pre-frail and frail
patients.

BACKGROUND: Physical frailty and loss of mobility in elderly individuals lead to 
reduced independence, quality of life, and increased mortality. Vitamin B12
deficiency has been linked to several age-related chronic diseases, including in 
the musculo-skeletal system, where vitamin B12 deficiency is generally believed
to be linked to poor nutritional intake. In the present study, we asked whether
aging and frailty associate with altered vitamin B12 homeostasis in humans and
investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms using preclinical models.
METHODS: We analysed a subset of the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study and
stratified 238 participants based on age and Fried frailty criteria. Levels of
methyl-malonic acid (MMA), a marker for vitamin B12 deficiency, and amnionless,
the vitamin B12 co-receptor that anchors the vitamin B12 transport complex to the
membrane of epithelial cells, were measured in plasma. In addition, vitamin B12
levels and the molecular mechanisms of vitamin B12 uptake and excretion were
analysed in ileum, kidney, liver, and blood using a rat model of natural aging
where nutritional intake is fully controlled.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that aging and frailty are associated with a higher
prevalence of functional vitamin B12 deficiency that can be detected by increased
levels of MMA in blood (ρ = 0.25; P = 0.00013). The decline in circulating
vitamin B12 levels is recapitulated in a rat model of natural aging where food
composition and intake are stable. At the molecular level, these perturbations
involve altered expression of amnionless in the ileum and kidney. Interestingly, 
we demonstrate that amnionless can be detected in serum where its levels increase
during aging in both rodents and human (P = 3.3e-07 and 9.2e-07, respectively).
Blood amnionless levels negatively correlate with vitamin B12 in rats (r2
 = 0.305; P = 0.0042) and positively correlate with the vitamin B12 deficiency
marker MMA in humans (ρ = 0.22; P = 0.00068).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that aging and frailty cause intrinsic
vitamin B12 deficiencies, which can occur independently of nutritional intake.
Mechanistically, vitamin B12 deficiency involves the physio-pathological decline 
of both the intestinal uptake and the renal reabsorption system for vitamin B12. 
Finally, amnionless is a novel biomarker which can detect perturbed vitamin B12
bioavailability during aging and physical frailty.

BACKGROUND: Although individuals classified as nonresident aliens, including
undocumented immigrants, are entitled to receive emergency dialysis in the United
States regardless of their ability to pay, most states do not provide them with
subsidized care for maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation. We explored
whether nonresident aliens have similar outcomes to US citizens after receiving
kidney transplants covered by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health
insurance program.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adult Medicaid patients in the US Renal Data System
who received their first kidney transplant from 1990 to 2011.
PREDICTOR: Citizenship status, categorized as US citizen, nonresident alien, or
permanent resident.
OUTCOME: All-cause transplant loss.
MEASUREMENTS: HRs and 95% CIs estimated by applying Cox proportional hazards
frailty models with transplantation center as a random effect.
RESULTS: Of 10,495 patients, 8,660 (82%) were US citizens, 1,489 (14%) were
permanent residents, and 346 (3%) were nonresident aliens, whom we assumed were
undocumented immigrants. Nonresident aliens were younger, healthier, receiving
dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a living donor. 71% underwent
transplantation in California, and 61% underwent transplantation after 2005.
Nonresident aliens had a lower unadjusted risk for transplant loss compared with 
US citizens (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still
significant when adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, dialysis, and
transplant-related factors (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94).
LIMITATIONS: Citizenship status was self-reported, possible residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the select group of insured nonresident
aliens who undergo transplantation with Medicaid do just as well as US citizens
with Medicaid. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for kidney
transplantation in nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, given
the associated high-quality outcomes in these patients.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of physical 
activity on various aspects in Asian dialysis patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Study participants were recruited
from 27 hospitals or dialysis centers in Korea (n = 1611). The participants were 
divided into 3 groups according to the degree of regular exercise: Inactive
group, Intermediate group, and Active group.
RESULTS: The proportions of patients with frailty and the presence of each
component decreased as physical activity increased. The presence and numbers of
disabilities decreased as physical activity increased. The number of participants
with a history of fall during the last 12 months was 149 (20.5%) in the Inactive 
group, 88 (16.9%) in the Intermediate group, and 48 (13.2%) in the Active group. 
Physical component scale and mental component scale scores increased as physical 
activity increased. The survival rate for all-cause death at 500 days was 95.5%
in the Active group, 95.2% in the Intermediate group, and 93.5% in the Inactive
group.
CONCLUSION: High physical activity was associated with favorable results for most
health-related quality of life scale scores, including frailty, disability, and
exhaustion, in Korean dialysis patients.

Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

BACKGROUND: To explore relevant associations between deviations in linear and
nonlinear heart rate variability (HRV) scores, and short-term morbidity and
mortality in patients undergoing hip-surgery after a fracture.
METHODS: 165 patients with hip fractures being admitted for surgery at two
hospitals were included in a prospective cohort study. A short-term ECG was
recorded within 24 hours of arrival. 15 patients had to be excluded due to
insufficient quality of the ECG recordings. 150 patients were included in the
final analysis. Linear parameters were calculated in time domain: standard
deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive differences
(rMSSD); and frequency domain: Total Power (TP), High Frequency Power (HF), Low
Frequency Power (LF), Very Low Frequency Power (VLF), and the ratio of LF/HF.
Postoperative outcome was evaluated at the time of discharge. This included
occurrence of pneumonia, overall infection rate, stroke, myocardial infarction,
and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Patients experiencing complications had significantly lower rMSSD (p =
0.04), and TP (p = 0.03) preoperatively. Postoperative infections were predicted 
by decreased VLF preoperatively (p = 0.04). There was a significant association
between pneumonia and LF/HF<1 (p = 0.03). The likelihood ratio to develop
pneumonia when LF/HF < 1 was 6,1.
CONCLUSION: HRV seems to reflect the general frailty of the patient with hip
fracture and might be used to identify patients in need of increased surveillance
or prophylactic treatment.

It is often of interest to compare centers or healthcare providers on quality of 
care delivered. We consider the setting where evaluation of center performance on
multiple competing events is of interest. We propose estimating center effects
through cause-specific proportional hazards frailty models that allow correlation
among a center's cause-specific effects. Estimation of our model proceeds via
penalized partial likelihood and is implemented in R. To evaluate center
performance, we also propose a directly standardized excess cumulative incidence 
(ECI) measure. Therefore, based on our proposed methods, practitioners can
evaluate centers either through the cause-specific hazards or the cumulative
incidence functions. We demonstrate, through simulations, the advantages of the
proposed methods to detect outlying centers, by comparing the proposed methods
and existing methods which assume uncorrelated random center effects. In
addition, we develop a Correlation Score Test to test the null hypothesis that
the competing event processes within a center are correlated. Using data from the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we apply our method to evaluate the
performance of Organ Procurement Organizations on two competing risks: (i)
receipt of a kidney transplant and (ii) death on the wait-list.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Technique failure is a major limitation of peritoneal 
dialysis. Our study aimed to identify center- and patient-level predictors of
peritoneal dialysis technique failure.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All patients on incident
peritoneal dialysis in Australia from 2004 to 2014 were included in the study
using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry.
Center- and patient-level characteristics associated with technique failure were 
evaluated using Cox shared frailty models. Death-censored technique failure and
cause-specific technique failure were analyzed as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: The study included 9362 patients from 51 centers in Australia. The
technique failure rate was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.36) episodes 
per patient-year, with a sevenfold variation across centers that was mainly
associated with center-level characteristics. Technique failure was significantly
less likely in centers with larger proportions of patients treated with
peritoneal dialysis (>29%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 
0.73 to 0.94) and more likely in smaller centers (<16 new patients per year;
adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.21) and centers
with lower proportions of patients achieving target baseline serum phosphate
levels (<40%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to
1.29). Similar results were observed for death-censored technique failure, except
that center target phosphate achievement was not significantly associated.
Technique failure due to infection, social reasons, mechanical causes, or death
was variably associated with center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal
dialysis, and/or target phosphate achievement, automated peritoneal dialysis
exposure, icodextrin use, and antifungal use. The variation of hazards of
technique failure across centers was reduced by 28% after adjusting for
patient-specific factors and an additional 53% after adding center-specific
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Technique failure varies widely across centers in Australia. A
significant proportion of this variation is related to potentially modifiable
center characteristics, including peritoneal dialysis center size, proportion of 
patients on peritoneal dialysis, and proportion of patients on peritoneal
dialysis achieving target phosphate level.

BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the
general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear
whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney failure.
METHODS: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults with
end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South
America designed to examine the association between periodontitis and all-cause
and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis.
Participants were matched 1:1 on their propensity score for moderate to severe
periodontitis assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal 
Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared
frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries.
RESULTS: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe
periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score methods to generate a
matched cohort of participants with periodontitis similar to those with none or
mild periodontal disease, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a 
lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74,
95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 
person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were
not changed substantially when participants were limited to those with 12 or more
natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes of cardiovascular death.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does not appear 
to be associated with an increased risk of early death in adults treated with
hemodialysis.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the significant clinical
predictors of incident heart failure (HF) and its prognostic effect on long-term 
outcomes among community-based patients with established atrial
fibrillation (AF).
BACKGROUND: AF is associated with an increased risk of HF. However, in this
population, little focus is placed on risk stratification for and the prevention 
of HF.
METHODS: Patients with AF but without HF at baseline enrolled in the ORBIT-AF
(Outcomes Registry for Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation) registry were
included. Separate multivariable-adjusted Cox frailty regression models were used
to identify significant predictors of HF incidence and determine the associated
risk of adverse clinical events.
RESULTS: The study included 6,545 participants with AF from 173 participating
sites. Incident HF developed in 236 participants (3.6%) over the 2-year follow-up
period; ejection fraction was preserved (>40%) in 64%, reduced (≤40%) in 13.5%,
and missing in 22.5%. In multivariable analysis, traditional HF risk factors
(age, coronary artery disease, renal dysfunction, and valvular disease), presence
of permanent AF (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.60 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18 to
2.16]; reference group: paroxysmal AF), and elevated baseline heart rate (HR:
1.07 [95% CI: 1.02 to 1.13] per 5 beats/min higher heart rate) were independently
associated with incident HF risk. Incident HF among patients with AF was
independently associated with higher risk of mortality, all-cause
hospitalization, and bleeding events.
CONCLUSIONS: Incident HF among patients with AF is common, is more likely to be
HF with preserved ejection fraction, and is associated with poor long-term
outcomes. Traditional HF risk factors, AF type, and baseline heart rate are
independent clinical predictors of incident HF.

Frailty is a powerful predictor of outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve
implantation (TAVI). Sarcopenia as assessed by psoas muscle area (PMA) is a
validated tool to assess frailty before surgical procedures. We evaluated PMA as 
a predictor of outcomes after TAVI in 152 consecutive patients who underwent this
procedure at our institution from 2011 to 2014. Preoperative computed tomography 
scans were used to measure PMA, which then was indexed to body surface area.
Outcomes evaluated included (1) early poor outcome (30 days mortality, stroke,
dialysis, and prolonged ventilation), (2) 1-year mortality, and (3) high-resource
utilization (length of stay >7 days, discharge to rehabilitation, or readmission 
within 30 days). Indexed PMA (odds ratio [OR] 3.19, confidence interval [CI] 1.30
to 7.83; p = 0.012) and age (OR 1.92, CI 1.87 to 1.98; p = 0.012) predicted early
poor outcome. Society of Thoracic Surgeons score predicted 1-year mortality
(hazard ratio 3.07, CI 1.93 to 6.23; p = 0.011). High-resource utilization was
observed more frequently in patients with PMA less than the median (73% vs 51%,
OR 2.65, CI 1.32 to 5.36; p = 0.006). In conclusion, indexed PMA predicts early
poor outcome and high-resource utilization after TAVI.

PURPOSE: Although a population's senescence rate is classically measured as the
increase in mortality rate with age on a logarithmic scale, it may be more
accurately measured as the increase on a linear scale. Patients on dialysis, who 
suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality
rate on a logarithmic scale, but a larger increase on a linear scale than
patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be
biased by population heterogeneity.
METHODS: Follow-up data on 323,308 patients on dialysis and 91,679 patients with 
a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We
measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models
that allow individual variation in this increase.
RESULTS: According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase 
in mortality rate on a logarithmic scale was smaller in patients on dialysis,
while the senescence rate measured as the increase on a linear scale was larger
in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant.
CONCLUSIONS: Also when accounting for population heterogeneity, a population's
senescence rate is more accurately measured as the increase in mortality rate on 
a linear scale than a logarithmic scale.

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its
impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
is less defined.
METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 
trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three
groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR
≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were
analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors
of 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the
PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767
(30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 
(12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted
Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with
severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher
prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of
death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate
and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% 
in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild
RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus
none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other
significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass
index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction,
oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male
sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year
mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is
required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

AIMS: To define a benchmark target for an invasive strategy (IS) rate appropriate
for performance assessment in intermediate-to-high risk non-ST-segment elevation 
acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS).
METHODS AND RESULTS: During the BLITZ-4 campaign, which aimed at improving the
quality of care in 163 Italian coronary care units, 4923/5786 (85.1%) of
consecutive patients admitted with NSTE-ACS with troponin elevation and/or
dynamic ST-T changes on the electrocardiogram were managed with IS. The reasons
driving the choice (RDC) for a conservative strategy (CS) in the remaining 863
patients were prospectively recorded. In 33.8%, CS was mandatory because of
patients refusal, known coronary anatomy or death before coronary angiography; in
52.8% it was clinically justified because of active stroke, bleeding, advanced
frailty, severe comorbidities, contraindication to antiplatelet therapy or
because they were considered to be at low risk; only in 13.4% the reasons, such
as renal failure, advanced age or other, were less stringent. As compared to
patients undergoing IS, those in the CS were 12years older and had significantly 
more severe comorbidities. The in-hospital and 6-month all-cause mortality were
9.0% vs 0.9% and 22.0% vs 3.9% in CS and IS groups respectively (p<0.0001 for
both).
CONCLUSION: As the RDC for CS were clinically correct in vast majority of cases
the observed 85% invasive strategy rate may be considered as the desirable
benchmark target in patients with NSTE-ACS. For the same reason, it remains
questionable if the higher rate of IS could have improved the prognosis in CS
patients, despite their highly unfavorable prognosis.

INTRODUCTION: Pneumatosis intestinalis (PI) and hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) 
are typically associated and are likely to represent a spectrum of the same
disease. The causes of both entities range from benign to life-threatening
conditions. Ischaemic causes are known to be fatal without emergency surgical
intervention.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: In this case a 93year old male experienced acute abdominal 
pain radiating to his back, with nausea and vomiting and a 2-week history of
altered bowel habit. Examination revealed abdominal tenderness and distension. He
had deranged white cell count (WCC) and renal function. Computed tomography (CT) 
revealed PI with associated HPVG. The cause was due to ischaemic pathology. The
patient was managed conservatively with antibiotics and was discharged 7days
later with resolution of his abdominal pain and WCC.
DISCUSSION: The pathogenesis of HPVG secondary to PI is poorly understood but
usually indicates intestinal ischaemia, thought to carry a mortality of around
75%. HPVG in the older patient usually necessitates emergency surgery however
this is not always in the patient's best interest.
CONCLUSION: There are few reported cases of patient survival following
conservative management of PI and HPVG secondary to ischaemic pathology. This
case demonstrates the possibility of managing this condition without aggressive
surgical intervention especially when surgery would likely result in mortality
due to frailty and morbidity. Further work is required to identify suitable
patients.

IMPORTANCE: Efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on
patients with cancer. High-quality end-of-life care is also critical for patients
with other illnesses.
OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of end-of-life care and family-rated quality of
care for patients dying with different serious illnesses.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was
conducted in all 146 inpatient facilities within the Veteran Affairs health
system among patients who died in inpatient facilities between October 1, 2009,
and September 30, 2012, with clinical diagnoses categorized as end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), cancer, cardiopulmonary failure (congestive heart failure or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), dementia, frailty, or other conditions.
Data analysis was conducted from April 1, 2014, to February 10, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Palliative care consultations, do-not-resuscitate
orders, death in inpatient hospices, death in the intensive care unit, and
family-reported quality of end-of-life care.
RESULTS: Among 57 753 decedents, approximately half of the patients with ESRD,
cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty received palliative care consultations
(adjusted proportions, 50.4%, 46.7%, and 43.7%, respectively) vs 73.5% of
patients with cancer and 61.4% of patients with dementia (P < .001).
Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or
frailty (adjusted proportions, 32.3%, 34.1%, and 35.2%, respectively) died in the
intensive care unit, more than double the rates among patients with cancer and
those with dementia (13.4% and 8.9%, respectively) (P < .001). Rates of excellent
quality of end-of-life care reported by 34 005 decedents' families were similar
for patients with cancer and those with dementia (adjusted proportions, 59.2% and
59.3%; P = .61), but lower for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or
frailty (54.8%, 54.8%, and 53.7%, respectively; all P ≤ .02 vs patients with
cancer). This quality advantage was mediated by palliative care consultation,
setting of death, and a code status of do-not-resuscitate; adjustment for these
variables rendered the association between diagnosis and overall end-of-life care
quality nonsignificant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Family-reported quality of end-of-life care was
significantly better for patients with cancer and those with dementia than for
patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty, largely owing to higher 
rates of palliative care consultation and do-not-resuscitate orders and fewer
deaths in the intensive care unit among patients with cancer and those with
dementia. Increasing access to palliative care and goals of care discussions that
address code status and preferred setting of death, particularly for patients
with end-organ failure and frailty, may improve the overall quality of
end-of-life care for Americans dying of these illnesses.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

PURPOSE: Prognosis of the increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) is poor with high risk of functional decline and mortality. 
Frailty seems to be a good predictor for those patients that will not benefit
from dialysis. Varying prevalences between populations are probably related to
the instrument used. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of
frailty among ESRD patients with two different validated instruments.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients, aged ≥18 years,
receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis care between
September 2013 and December 2013 in a single dialysis center in Apeldoorn, the
Netherlands. Frailty was measured with the frailty index (FI) and frailty
phenotype (FP).
RESULTS: Prevalence of frailty by the FI was 36.8 % among 95 participants with
ESRD (age: 65.2 years, SD ± 12.0). Frailty prevalence among participants aged ≥65
and <65 years was 43.6 and 27.5 %, respectively. Female sex [odds ratio (OR) 3.3,
95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.3-8.0] and a Charlson comorbidity index score of 
≥5 (OR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.0-6.6) were associated with frailty. The FI identified
different but overlapping participants as frail compared with the FP; 62.5 % of
frail participants according to FI were also frail according to the FP.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of frailty among young and elderly ESRD patients is high;
being female and having more comorbidity was associated with frailty. Use of a
broader definition of frailty, like the FI, gives a higher estimation of
prevalence among ESRD patients compared with a physical frailty assessment.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is related
to frailty and to characterize the nature of their joint association with
mortality.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis for frailty and longitudinal cohort analysis for
mortality.
SETTING: Cardiovascular Health Study.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals (N = 2,977; mean age 77.9 ± 4.7, 40%
male, 83% white).
MEASUREMENTS: The predictor was serum FGF-23 concentration (C-terminal
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the outcomes were frailty status
(determined according to frailty phenotype criteria of weight loss, weakness,
exhaustion, slowness, and low physical activity) and mortality. Multinomial
logistic regression was used to assess the cross-sectional association between
FGF-23 and frailty and prefrailty, adjusting for demographic characteristics,
cardiovascular disease and risk factors, and kidney markers. Proportional hazards
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between
FGF-23, frailty, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 64 ± 17 mL/min per 
1.73 m(2) . Median FGF-23 was 70.3 RU/mL (interquartile range 53.4-99.2); 52%
were prefrail, and 13% were frail. After multivariate adjustment, each doubling
in FGF-23 concentration was associated with 38% (95% confidence interval (CI) =
17-62%) higher odds of frailty than of nonfrailty and 16% (95% CI = 3-30%) higher
odds of prefrailty. FGF-23 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.10-1.23) and
frailty (HR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.57-2.12) were independently associated with
mortality, but neither association was meaningfully attenuated when adjusted for 
the other.
CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of older adults, higher FGF-23 was independently
associated with prevalent frailty and prefrailty. FGF-23 and frailty were
independent and additive risk factors for mortality. FGF-23 may be a marker for
functional outcomes.

[Hyponatremia in the elderly: its role in frailty].

[Article in French]

Hanotier P.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in elderly patients. The
incidence is about 7% in elderly healthy people but can exceed 40% in
hospitalized patients. Considering all its aetiologies hyponatremia is associated
with increased mortality and appears as a factor of poor prognosis. Alteration in
the regulation of water homeostasis in the elderly result from multiple
consequence of aging: change in body composition, alteration in renal function
and hormonal changes. The high frequency of nutritional problems, particularly
protein malnutrition predisposes the elderly to the development of hyponatremia. 
Although diuretics especially thiazides are implicated as a frequent cause of
hyponatremia on geriatric medicine, normovolemic hyponatremia and more
particularly the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis is the most common cause.
The aetiology of this syndrome can be determined in only approximately half of
the cases. Cancers and medications, principally psychotropic agents commonly
prescribed in geriatrics are the most frequent aetiologies. Hyponatremia could be
a factor of frailty in geriatrics. Mild to moderate hyponatremia is generally
considered asymptomatic but recent studies reported that asymptomatic
hyponatremia contributes to neurological troubles like cognitive disorders,
posture and gait impairments. Hyponatremia could be an independent risk factor of
falls and could be associated with the development of osteoporosis. This review
of the literature emphasizes the importance of screening and a systematic
management of hyponatremia in the elderly people, even in the minor forms and
those considered as asymptomatic.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement
can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light
chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies
have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We
evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in
France.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered
in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 
with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored
for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as
renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and 
causes of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334
(23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72
years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was
observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation
was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis,
67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were 
malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and
cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty 
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high
BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is
poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of
death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

Kidney Transplantation Among the Elderly: Challenges and Opportunities to Improve
Outcomes.

Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among
the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample
evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the
best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to
remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this
population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive
impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to
transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after
transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and
affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can
increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death
with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney
allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft
utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer
wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to
kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and
propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a clinically recognized syndrome of decreased
physiological reserve. The heightened state of vulnerability in these patients
confers a greater risk of adverse outcomes after even minor stressors. Our aim
was to assess the prevalence and prognostic significance of the frailty phenotype
in patients referred for heart transplantation.
METHODS: Consecutive patients referred or on the waiting list for heart
transplantation from March 2013 underwent frailty assessment. Frailty was defined
as a positive response to 3 or more of the following 5 components: weak grip
strength, slowed walking speed, poor appetite, physical inactivity, and
exhaustion. In addition, markers of disease severity were obtained, and all
patients underwent cognitive (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and depression
(Depression in Medical Illness-10) screening.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients (83 men:37 women; age, 53 ± 12 years, range,
16-73 years; left ventricular ejection fraction, 27 ± 14%) underwent frailty
assessment. Thirty-nine of 120 patients (33%) were assessed as frail. Frailty was
associated with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure, lower body
mass index, elevated intracardiac filling pressures, lower cardiac index, anemia,
hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, cognitive impairment, and depression (all ρ 
< 0.05). Frailty was independent of age, sex, heart failure duration, left
ventricular ejection fraction, or renal function. Frailty was an independent
predictor of increased all-cause mortality: 1 year actuarial survival was 79 ± 5%
in the nonfrail group compared with only 54 ± 9% for the frail group (P < 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is prevalent among patients with advanced symptomatic heart

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the
elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in
comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly
individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength,
body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and
endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined
outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were
assessed.
METHODS: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient
drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12
months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc
Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail
and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition
(DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years 
old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After 
some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30
to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; 
IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 
14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 
2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the 
casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that
frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney
disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either
worse endothelial function or mortality.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established technique for
the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Data on long-term TAVI
outcomes, both hemodynamic and clinical, in real-world practice settings are
limited. We aim to explore the long-term clinical results in patients with severe
symptomatic aortic stenosis using multiple catheter-based options: 360
TAVI-treated patients were followed up for ≤5 years. The Medtronic CoreValve was 
used in 71% and the Edwards SAPIEN in 26%. The primary end point was all-cause
mortality during follow-up. Outcomes were assessed based on the Valve Academic
Research Consortium 2 criteria. The mean ± SD patient age was 82.1 ± 6.9 years
(56.4% women). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 7.5 ± 4.7. The clinical
efficacy end point and time-related valve safety at 3 years was 50% and 81.7%,
respectively. The calculated 3- and 5-year survival rates were 71.6% and 56.4%,
respectively. Five-year follow-up data were obtained for 54 patients alive; 96.2%
of alive patients were in the New York Heart Association class I and II, 4 years 
after TAVI. No gender differences in all-cause mortality rates were observed (p =
0.58). In multivariate analysis, hospitalization 6 months previous to TAVI
(hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 3.15, p = 0.01),
frailty (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.2, p = 0.02), acute kidney injury (HR 1.93,
95% CI 1.03 to 3.61, p = 0.04), and moderate or more paravalvular aortic
regurgitation after TAVI (HR 4.26, 95% CI 2.54 to 7.15, p <0.001) were
independent predictors for all-cause mortality. In conclusion, long-term outcomes
of TAVI are encouraging. Prevention and early identification of paravalvular leak
and acute renal failure after the procedure would improve short- and long-term
outcomes.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) is
increasingly performed in nonagenarians. There is scarce evidence on the
feasibility and safety of balloon-expandable TAVI in this patient population. A
total of 734 patients who underwent balloon-expandable TAVI at our institute were
included in the study. We compared 136 patients who were aged at least 90 years
at the time of TAVI (mean age 92.4 ± 2.4 years) with the remaining 598 younger
patients (mean age 79.7 ± 7.8 years). Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 end
points were compared between the 2 groups. Diabetes mellitus, coronary artery
disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and chronic lung disease were
significantly less prevalent in patients aged ≥90 years. In contrast, the
prevalence of frailty, chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation was
significantly higher in these patients. Device success was 96% in both groups.
All-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year was 2.9% and 12.5% versus 2.8% and
12.3% in patients aged ≥90 and <90, respectively (p = 0.95 for both). All major
complication rates were similar between groups. Nonagenarians had higher rates of
minor vascular complications (13.2% vs 7.7%; p = 0.04). In conclusion, performing
balloon-expandable TAVI in carefully selected group of nonagenarians is feasible 
and offers clinical benefit comparable to patients aged <90 years. Advanced age, 
in the absence of significant co-morbidities, should not deter clinicians from
evaluating patients for TAVI for severe AS.

BACKGROUND: Dental disease is more extensive in adults with chronic kidney
disease, but whether dental health and behaviors are associated with survival in 
the setting of hemodialysis is unknown.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multinational cohort.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,205 adults treated with long-term hemodialysis, 2010 to
2012 (Oral Diseases in Hemodialysis [ORAL-D] Study).
PREDICTORS: Dental health as assessed by a standardized dental examination using 
World Health Organization guidelines and personal oral care, including
edentulousness; decayed, missing, and filled teeth index; teeth brushing and
flossing; and dental health consultation.
OUTCOMES: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months after dental
assessment.
MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models
fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within
countries.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 22.1 months, 942 deaths occurred, including
477 cardiovascular deaths. Edentulousness (adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.51) 
and decayed, missing, or filled teeth score ≥ 14 (adjusted HR, 1.70; 95% CI,
1.33-2.17) were associated with early all-cause mortality, while dental flossing,
using mouthwash, brushing teeth daily, spending at least 2 minutes on oral
hygiene daily, changing a toothbrush at least every 3 months, and visiting a
dentist within the past 6 months (adjusted HRs of 0.52 [95% CI, 0.32-0.85], 0.79 
[95% CI, 0.64-0.97], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58-0.99], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-0.99], 0.79
[95% CI, 0.65-0.95], and 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.96], respectively) were associated 
with better survival. Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar.
LIMITATIONS: Convenience sample of clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: In adults treated with hemodialysis, poorer dental health was
associated with early death, whereas preventive dental health practices were
associated with longer survival.

Controlling Time-Dependent Confounding by Health Status and Frailty: Restriction 
Versus Statistical Adjustment.

McGrath LJ, Ellis AR, Brookhart MA.

Nonexperimental studies of preventive interventions are often biased because of
the healthy-user effect and, in frail populations, because of confounding by
functional status. Bias is evident when estimating influenza vaccine
effectiveness, even after adjustment for claims-based indicators of illness. We
explored bias reduction methods while estimating vaccine effectiveness in a
cohort of adult hemodialysis patients. Using the United States Renal Data System 
and linked data from a commercial dialysis provider, we estimated vaccine
effectiveness using a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model of
all-cause mortality before and during 3 influenza seasons in 2005/2006 through
2007/2008. To improve confounding control, we added frailty indicators to the
model, measured time-varying confounders at different time intervals, and
restricted the sample in multiple ways. Crude and baseline-adjusted marginal
structural models remained strongly biased. Restricting to a healthier population
removed some unmeasured confounding; however, this reduced the sample size,
resulting in wide confidence intervals. We estimated an influenza vaccine
effectiveness of 9% (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.15)
when bias was minimized through cohort restriction. In this study, the
healthy-user bias could not be controlled through statistical adjustment;
however, sample restriction reduced much of the bias.

BACKGROUND: The levels of many laboratory parameters are associated with the
outcomes of dialysis patients, but the significance of their variability has not 
been well studied.
METHODS: A total of 384 patients receiving stable hemodialysis treatment during
2002 were followed up for mortality until the end of 2013. The within-patient
coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for 13 laboratory parameters from 
1 year of data. We defined variability as CV and analyzed the survival of the
patients according to the baseline CV values of each parameter by proportional
hazard modeling.
RESULTS: During the 11-year observation period, 125 patients died. Higher CV
levels for eight parameters, namely, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium,
hemoglobin, creatinine, total protein, albumin, potassium and phosphate, were
significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The adjusted hazard ratios for
a high BUN-CV (>15 %) and a high Na-CV (>1.3 %) against a lower CV were 1.92 (95 
% CI 1.31-2.81) and 1.95 (1.36-2.80), respectively. The increased mortality risk 
associated with each variability was attributed to excess non-cardiac deaths. The
CV values of most parameters were correlated with each other and often exhibited 
negative associations with age, diabetes, and mobility as well as the levels of
hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, Na, the protein catabolic rate, and the
creatinine generation rate. Therefore, a high variability was generally
associated with frailty-related adverse prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The variability of several blood parameters had a significant impact
on all-cause and non-cardiac mortality. The levels of the variabilities were most
likely related to poor physical conditions of the patients.

Chronic heart failure (CHF) is the leading cause of hospitalization for those
over the age of 65 and represents a significant clinical and economic burden.
About half of hospital re-admissions are related to co-morbidities, polypharmacy 
and disabilities associated with CHF. Moreover, CHF also has an enormous cost in 
terms of poor prognosis with an average one year mortality of 33%-35%. While more
than half of patients with CHF are over 75 years, most clinical trials have
included younger patients with a mean age of 61 years. Inadequate data makes
treatment decisions challenging for the providers. Older CHF patients are more
often female, have less cardiovascular diseases and associated risk factors, but 
higher rates of non-cardiovascular conditions and diastolic dysfunction. The
prevalence of CHF with reduced ejection fraction, ischemic heart disease, and its
risk factors declines with age, whereas the prevalence of non-cardiac
co-morbidities, such as chronic renal failure, dementia, anemia and malignancy
increases with age. Diabetes and hypertension are among the strongest risk
factors as predictors of CHF particularly among women with coronary heart
disease. This review paper will focus on the specific consideration for CHF
assessment in the older population. Management strategies will be reviewed,
including non-pharmacologic, pharmacologic, quality care indicators, quality
improvement in care transition and lastly, end-of-life issues. Palliative care
should be an integral part of an interdisciplinary team approach for a
comprehensive care plan over the whole disease trajectory. In addition, frailty
contributes valuable prognostic insight incremental to existing risk models and
assists clinicians in defining optimal care pathways for their patients.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the protective effect of metformin against death 
is modified by frailty status in older adults with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cohort study during October 1,
1999-September 30, 2006 among veterans aged 65-89 years old with type 2 diabetes 
but without history of liver, renal diseases, or cancers, who had sulfonylureas
or metformin as the sole antidiabetic drug for ≥180 days. The Cox proportional
hazard model was used to compare hazard rates of all-cause mortality between the 
metformin and sulfonylurea users adjusting for the propensity score of metformin 
use and covariates: age, race/ethnicity, diabetes duration, Charlson comorbidity 
score, statin use, smoking status, BMI, LDL, and HbA1c.
RESULTS: In this cohort of 2,415 veterans, 307 (12.7%) were metformin users,
2,108 (87.3%) were sulfonylurea users, the mean age was 73.7±5.2 years, the mean 
study period was 5.6±2.3 years, the mean HbA1c at baseline was 6.7±1.0%, 23% had 
diabetes for ≥10 years, and 43.6% (N=1,048) died during the study period. For
patients with and without frailty, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of death for
metformin vs. sulfonylurea use were 0.92 (95% CI=0.90-1.31, p-value=0.19) and
0.69 (95% CI = 0.60-0.79, p-value<0.001), respectively. Logistic regression
analyses showed that metformin (vs. sulfonylurea) was significantly associated
with a decreased odds of frailty (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.61-0.71, p-value <.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that metformin could potentially promote longevity
via preventing frailty in older adults with type 2 diabetes.

Today, old age does not represent a formal contraindication to kidney
transplantation. Rather, there is evidence that in elderly patients renal
transplantation offers longer life expectancy and better quality of life in
comparison with dialysis. Yet, the results of renal transplantation in recipients
older than 65years are inferior to those observed in younger adults, death with
functioning graft representing a major cause of failure. Therefore, the selection
of aged patients is of paramount importance. Apart from the routine clinical and 
biological investigations, three aspects have been relatively neglected by the
transplant community and may require a careful analysis in elderly candidates to 
transplantation: the presence and degree of frailty, the presence of
comorbidities and the adherence to prescriptions. Although there are rapid and
simple tests for assessing the degree of frailty in the elderly, there is no
clear cut-off value to decide whether a patient should be accepted or not. With
advanced age the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular events and other
diseases tend to increase. The use of combined age-comorbidity indices may be
helpful to identify patients at high risk of mortality. Another critical point is
the poor unintentional adherence to treatment, often caused by forgetfulness and 
mild cognitive impairment. These drawbacks may be further enhanced by a high
number of pills to take and by changes in the dosage or type of prescriptions. A 
careful screening of the presence and degree of frailty, comorbidity and poor
compliance to treatment is highly recommended before admitting older candidates
to the waiting list for transplantation.

Older people have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) of
any age group and are thus frequent users of glucose-lowering agents. Because
individuals 65 years or older are underrepresented in clinical studies, there is 
a lack of information regarding the efficacy and safety of available treatments
in this population. Additionally, a high prevalence of comorbidities,
polypharmacy, and frailty can make treatment of T2DM in this population
challenging. Safety is an important consideration when choosing a treatment for
older individuals. Renal impairment is quite common in older patients with T2DM
and can contribute to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can lead to serious
consequences, such as falls and fractures, and cognitive changes. As such,
hemoglobin A₁c treatment targets, typically <7% in the general population, are
less stringent in older people, with the goal being an individualized target that
balances efficacy and safety. Many glucose-lowering agents can cause adverse
events detrimental to older individuals, such as hypoglycemia (insulin,
sulfonylureas), weight gain (sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones), gastrointestinal
events (metformin), and fractures (thiazolidinediones), and are contraindicated
or require dose adjustments in those with renal impairment (most oral/injectable 
agents). Orally administered dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors have a low
risk of hypoglycemia and are generally well tolerated. Linagliptin is the only
DPP-4 inhibitor excreted through nonrenal pathways and therefore does not require
any dose adjustment in older patients with kidney disease. This paper reviews the
findings of a recent study by Barnett et al assessing the efficacy and safety of 
the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin in patients with T2DM aged 70 years or older,
which concluded that linagliptin may be a useful glucose-lowering option for
older patients with T2DM.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among elderly people is
increasing. Often associated with disabilities/comorbidities, T2DM lowers the
chances of successful aging and is independently associated with frailty and an
increased risk of hypoglycaemia, which can be further exacerbated by
antihyperglycaemic treatment. From this perspective, the clinical management of
T2DM in the elderly is challenging and requires individualization of optimum
glycaemic targets depending on comorbidities, cognitive functioning and ability
to recognize and self-manage the disease. The lack of solid evidence-based
medicine supporting treatment guidelines for older people with diabetes further
complicates the matter. Several classes of medicine for the treatment of T2DM are
currently available and different drug combinations are often required to achieve
individualized glycaemic goals. Many of these drugs, however, carry disadvantages
such as the propensity to cause weight gain or hypoglycaemia. Dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, a recent addition to the pharmacological
armamentarium, have become widely accepted in clinical practice because of their 
efficacy, low risk of hypoglycaemia, neutral effect on body weight, and
apparently greater safety in patients with kidney failure. Although more
information is needed to reach definitive conclusions, growing evidence suggests 
that DPP-4 inhibitors may become a valuable component in the pharmacological
management of elderly people with T2DM. The present review aims to delineate the 
potential advantages of this pharmacological approach in the treatment of elderly
people with T2DM.

Center, Baltimore VA Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in 
individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on 
their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of
cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that
highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid
conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating
cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including
microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally,
studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected
in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with
worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk
of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible
short-term effects on markers of physical performance.
SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to 
better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides
(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

The association of physical activity and physical function with clinical outcomes
in adults with chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of
physical functioning and encouragement of physical activity in management of the 
patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), implementation has been undermined by 
a lack of understanding of the evidence for this recommendation. The purpose of
this review is to present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic
cohorts that report associations between low levels of physical functioning
and/or low physical activity and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Low levels of physical activity and poor physical functioning
are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical outcomes in adult
patients with CKD, regardless of treatment modality. Low physical performance and
activity limitations are more prevalent in patients with CKD, regardless of age, 
compared to older community-dwelling adults.
SUMMARY: The strength of the evidence presented should strongly motivate a focus 
of treatment on assessing and improving physical activity and physical function
as part of routine patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical
activity interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of
age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that is
similar to or higher than the general population of elderly adults; physical
activity, physical function, and performance are strongly associated with
all-cause mortality; and exercise training and exercise counseling have been
shown to improve measures of physical functioning.

BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in management have been highlighted as contributory
factors in the death of many patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). However,
there is little evidence addressing the quality of care provided to patients with
milder AKI.
AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of care provided to a
non-select cohort of patients with AKI and evaluate discrepancies in causation,
recognition and management.
DESIGN: Retrospective inception cohort study.
METHODS: Demographic data were collected for all 1577 patients admitted to a
University Teaching Hospital during a 1-month period. Baseline, admission and
peak creatinine were correlated with mortality and length of hospital admission. 
AKI was classified according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
criteria. A retrospective case note review of all patients with AKI was carried
out to evaluate quality of documentation and clinical management of AKI.
Multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors for AKI.
RESULTS: Incidence of AKI on admission was 4.6%. A further 10.3% developed AKI
while in hospital. All cause mortality was 4-fold higher among patients with AKI 
compared with those without (19 vs. 3.8%; P < 0.001). Mortality was significantly
higher in those patients who developed AKI while an in-patient compared with
those with AKI on admission (27.3 vs. 11.8%; P < 0.001). Diabetes, clinician
perception of frailty, age and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor prior to admission were found to be independent risk factors for AKI.
AKI was unrecognized in 23.5% of patients, two-thirds of whom were discharged
without resolution of renal function. Significant weaknesses in management were
poorly kept fluid balance charts (48.2%), failure to withhold nephrotoxic drugs
(38.8%) and failure to act upon abnormal biochemistry (41%) in a timely fashion.
CONCLUSION: AKI is common in hospitalized patients and associated with a
significant increase in hospital stay and mortality. AKI is often found in
conjunction with other organ failure and in many cases is not preventable.
Nevertheless clinicians need to be more vigilant of small creatinine rises to
permit early intervention particularly among elderly and frail patients.

The present study examined the association between patient-reported anxiety and
postcardiac surgery mortality and major morbidity. Frailty Assessment Before
Cardiac Surgery was a prospective multicenter cohort study of elderly patients
undergoing cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass surgery and/or valve repair or
replacement) at 4 tertiary care hospitals from 2008 to 2009. The patients were
evaluated a mean of 2 days preoperatively with the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale, a validated questionnaire assessing depression and anxiety in
hospitalized patients. The primary predictor variable was a high level of
anxiety, defined by a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score of ≥ 11. The
main outcome measure was all-cause mortality or major morbidity (e.g., stroke,
renal failure, prolonged ventilation, deep sternal wound infection, or
reoperation) occurring during the index hospitalization. Multivariable logistic
regression analysis examined the association between high preoperative anxiety
and all-cause mortality/major morbidity, adjusting for the Society of Thoracic
Surgeons predicted risk, age, gender, and depression symptoms. A total of 148
patients (mean age 75.8 ± 4.4 years; 34% women) completed the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale. High levels of preoperative anxiety were present in 7% of
patients. No differences were found in the type of surgery and Society of
Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk across the preoperative levels of anxiety. After
adjusting for potential confounders, high preoperative anxiety was remained
independently predictive of postoperative mortality or major morbidity (odds
ratio 5.1, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 20.2; p = 0.02). In conclusion,
although high levels of anxiety were present in few patients anticipating cardiac
surgery, this conferred a strong and independent heightened risk of mortality or 
major morbidity.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia tends to follow an indolent course and despite
infiltration of leukemic cells in numerous organs, resultant target organ damage 
is uncommon. We present a case of an 83-year-old Caucasian lady who presented
with rapidly worsening renal impairment over a several month period with a serum 
creatinine peak of 2.82 mg/dl. Despite numerous investigations an immediate cause
was not apparent. A renal biopsy was therefore conducted which revealed dense
infiltration of the interstitium with small lymphocytic lymphoma. Given her age
and frailty she was treated with single alkylating agent chemotherapy
(chlorambucil). This resulted in a marked decrease in lymphocyte count and
resolution of renal impairment close to her previous baseline level. To our
knowledge, this is the first case in the literature to demonstrate a marked
resolution in renal impairment with chlorambucil alone. We also highlight the
value of renal biopsy in identifying a rare cause of renal impairment.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced
functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing
the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the
CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or
evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based
cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study.
OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association
with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more
of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss,
exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum
cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to
relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was
51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much
older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components
were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes,
eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a
2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of
frailty compared with GFR(cys) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during 
a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was
associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or 
dialysis therapy.
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal
relationships between CKD and frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is
associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.

BACKGROUND: For chronic hemodialysis, the ideal permanent vascular access is the 
arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Temporary catheters should be reserved for acute
dialysis needs. The AVF is associated with lower infection rates, better clinical
results, and a higher quality of life and survival when compared to temporary
catheters. In Brazil, the proportion of patients with temporary catheters for
more than 3 months from the beginning of therapy is used as an evaluation of the 
quality of renal units. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated
with the time between the beginning of hemodialysis with temporary catheters and 
the placement of the first arteriovenous fistula in Brazil.
METHODS: This is an observational, prospective non-concurrent study using
national administrative registries of all patients financed by the public health 
system who began renal replacement therapy (RRT) between 2000 and 2004 in Brazil.
Incident patients were eligible who had hemodialysis for the first time. Patients
were excluded who: had hemodialysis reportedly started after the date of death
(inconsistent database); were younger than 18 years old; had HIV; had no record
of the first dialysis unit; and were dialyzed in units with less than twenty
patients. To evaluate individual and renal unit factors associated with the event
of interest, the frailty model was used (N = 55,589).
RESULTS: Among the 23,824 patients (42.9%) who underwent fistula placement in the
period of the study, 18.2% maintained the temporary catheter for more than three 
months until the fistula creation. The analysis identified five statistically
significant factors associated with longer time until first fistula: higher age
(Hazard-risk - HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00); having hypertension and cardiovascular
diseases (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.98) as the cause of chronic renal disease;
residing in capitals cities (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95) and certain regions in
Brazil - South (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.8-0.87), Midwest (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94),
Northeast (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94), or North (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94) and
the type of renal unit (public or private).
CONCLUSION: Monitoring the provision of arteriovenous fistulas in renal units
could improve the care given to patients with end stage renal disease.

AIM: To provide evidence based recommendations for optimal care diabetes care in 
the elderly.
BACKGROUND: Diabetes affects approximately 25% of the population ≥65 years, and
that percentage is increasing rapidly, particularly in minorities who represent
an important fraction of the uninsured/underinsured. Diabetes is an important
cause of hospital admissions and a co-morbidity in as high as 50% of hospital
inpatients. It impacts mortality and quality of life. While tools have become
available to improve glycemic control, enthusiasm for their application must be
tempered with the sober realization of the risks involved in intensification of
glycemic control, chiefly hypoglycemia.
METHODS: Weighted review from PubMed and other literature search tools in
descending order of randomized control trials, observational studies, pilot
studies, published guidelines, the authors' clinical experience, and expert
opinion.
RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: • HbA1c targets should be stratified according to the
frailty of the elderly diabetic patient: <7.0% in the generally well elderly and 
< 8.0% in the frail elderly. • Therapies are available that achieve glycemic
goals, while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia, taking into consideration such 
factors as cognitive function, renal and hepatic function, bone density, fall
risk, and hypoglycemia unawareness. • When insulin is used determir or glargine
are safer choices than NPH. • Ultra-short acting prandial insulins are safer than
regular insulin. • Pen devices for insulin delivery significantly reduce dosing
errors and the risk of hypoglycemia. • Sudden managed care formulary changes that
disrupt patients' diabetes treatment should be prevented through national policy 
initiatives. • Up to date home medication lists help prevent dangerous medication
errors. • Widespread adoption of telehealth approaches can significantly improve 
glycemic control and render it safer.

Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in developed countries and 
its incidence and severity is greater among older patients. So, because of the
ageing of the population, clinicians will be increasingly confronted in daily
practice with managing acute coronary syndrome in extreme old age and high-risk
patients. Despite this demographic reality, several large randomized controlled
trials evaluating the benefit-risk ratio of invasive versus conservative approach
have systematically excluded elderly patients. The extrapolation of
evidence-based medicine, initially focused on younger patients, is often
contentious in this population and because of the lack of clear and specific
recommendations in the elderly, the optimal management of STEMI in octogenarians 
remains a topic of debate. Elderly patients present unique issues related to the 
ageing process and multiple comorbid diseases making difficult the extrapolation 
of evidence obtained on younger demographics. Data from registries seem to
support, nevertheless, the benefit of primary revascularization by PCI of the
culprit lesion in "selected" octogenarians with a high technical success rate,
few complications, acceptable short and long-term mortality rate and quality of
life. Obviously, the "ideal octogenarian" doesn't exist and all the old patients 
are not suitable for an invasive approach. Managing elderly patients requires not
only cardiological skills but also geriatric acknowledges and the individualized 
geriatric assessment is the corner store of the decision process. The aim is to
screen for the presence of comorbidities (cognitive disorders, functional
decline, anemia, renal insufficiency…), social isolation and existence of an
underlying frailty. To conclude, the optimal strategy for the management of STEMI
in octogenarians is not univocal: the best approach is the one that offers the
greater benefits regard considerations of general health.

Health-related quality of life outcomes in chronic kidney disease.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

Diabetic foot ulcerations result from different physiopathological mechanisms; a 
clear understanding of them is crucial to reduce their incidence, provide early
care, and finally delay the amputation risk. The three main diabetes
complications involved in foot ulcerations are neuropathy, peripheral arterial
disease, and infection. The most common pathway to ulceration is peripheral
sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy, leading to loss of sensitivity, foot
deformities, high foot pressure, and dry skin. Peripheral arterial disease is
more frequent and more serious in the diabetic population. It delays
cicatrization and causes gangrene and finally amputation. Infection is also a
major complication of ulceration because of its risk of spreading into deep
tissue and bone, which increases the risk of amputation. Infection may also
generalize and become life-threatening. These complications preferentially affect
the foot because it is exposed to hyper pressure, neuropathy, and peripheral
arterial disease, which cause distal lesions, and the foot is exposed to a closed
atmosphere, a source of soaking and skin frailty. Diabetes itself may enhance the
risk of complications stemming from the disease's long-term progression and poor 
glucose control, thereby affecting ocular and renal functions. Finally, some
psychosocial situations such as depression syndrome or poor hygiene possibly
enhance diabetic foot occurrence.

BACKGROUND: Given the volume and cost of inpatient care during the last year of
life, there is a critical need to identify patterns of dying as a means of
planning end-of-life care services, especially for the growing number of older
persons who receive services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
METHODS: A retrospective computerized record review was conducted of 20,933 VHA
patients who died as inpatients between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002.
Diagnoses were aggregated into one of five classification patterns of death and
analyzed in terms of health care resource utilization (mean number of inpatient
days and cumulative outpatient visits in the year preceding the patient's death).
RESULTS: Cancer deaths were the most common (30.4%) followed by end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) (23.2%), cardiopulmonary failure (21.4%), frailty (11.6%), "other"
diagnoses (7.3%), and sudden deaths (6.1%). Those with ESRD were more likely to
be male and nonwhite (p < 0.05) and those with frailty were more likely to be
older and married (p < 0.05). Controlling for demographic variables, those with
frailty had the highest number of inpatient days while those with ESRD had the
highest number of outpatient visits. Non-married status was associated with more 
inpatient days, especially among younger decedents.
CONCLUSION: As a recognized leader in end-of-life care, the VHA can play a unique
role in the development of specific interventions that address the diverse needs 
of persons with different dying trajectories identified through this research.

Anemia signifies an underlying disease and is associated with poor clinical
outcomes. In elderly patients, in whom anemia has a high prevalence (greater than
10 percent), neither the hemoglobin threshold for concern nor the identity of the
anemia-causing disease is easily established. This is an important shortfall,
because even mild anemia can compromise patient well-being and survival,
regardless of the underlying cause. This review discusses definitions of "normal"
hemoglobin levels in adults, common causes of anemia in people aged 65 years and 
older (eg, nutritional deficiency, renal insufficiency, inflammatory disorders,
and myelodysplastic syndrome), and potential consequences of anemia in elderly
patients (eg, poorer cognitive status, increased frailty, and an elevated risk of
hospitalization and of complications during hospitalization). We also outline a
practical initial diagnostic approach that helps determine appropriate treatment,
and we weigh therapeutic options in light of new safety concerns regarding
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common cause of functional disability in the
elderly. Pain and loss of motion induce a vicious circle, leading to instability,
frailty and ultimately invalidity. Currently, there is no treatment to reverse or
slow the disease progression to a clinically meaningful extent. Thus, the primary
goal of OA treatment in the elderly is pain relief and preservation of joint
function. For this, pharmacological, non-pharmacological and if necessary
surgical treatment regimes must form an integrated concept. However, the real
challenge is polymorbidity and other age-related or age-associated factors, which
influence the course of disease and its therapy unfavorably. The changes in
pharmacokinetics and -dynamics in the elderly can be compensated for the
nonopioid and opioid-analgesics by the well known "start low, go slow" approach. 
More problematic are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are
most often used for symptomatic treatment of OA: Patients over 65 have an
enhanced susceptibility to the gastrointestinal and renal side effects of NSAIDs;
all NSAIDs, not only coxibs, increase the cardiovascular risk in patients with
such a disease; number and severity of drug interactions is elevated due to
age-associated polypharmacy. Thus, NSAIDs, including coxibs, should be used with 
great caution for treatment of OA in the elderly.

The emergence of the sub-speciality geriatric nephrology is an exciting
development for the future. The main objectives should be to maximise patient
independence and minimise deterioration and learn dependent behaviour in this
population. To achieve these goals a holistic approach needs to be taken, to the 
patient, their environment and the efficacy of such units, and this can only be
achieved using a multi-disciplinary team approach. In the creation of a geriatric
nephrology unit it is important to identify the factors that cause frailty and,
if possible, modify or prevent the initial decline using nutritional and other
interventions. This requires careful monitoring, not only using the traditional
markers of renal disease including urea and creatinine, but also using
instruments that measure functional ability. These issues are discussed under the
headings prevention, documentation and planning.
