BACKGROUND: The modified 5-item frailty index (mFI-5) is a concise
comorbidity-based risk stratification tool that has been shown to predict the
occurrence of adverse outcomes following various orthopedic surgeries.
METHODS: The 2012-2016 American College of Surgeons - National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) dataset was used to identify patients undergoing 
an elective 1- to 2-level posterior lumbar fusion for degenerative lumbar
pathology. The mFI-5 score was calculated based on the presence of the 5
co-morbidities: congestive heart failure within 30 days prior to surgery,
insulin-dependent or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease or pneumonia, partially dependent or totally dependent
functional health status at time of surgery, and hypertension requiring
medication. Multivariate analysis was used to assess the independent impact of
increasing mFI-5 score on postoperative morbidity while controlling for baseline 
clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: Increasing mFI-5 score versus mFI-5 = 0 was associated with higher odds 
of any complication (mFI-5 ≥2: odds ratio [OR] 1.45; mFI-5 = 1: OR 1.22), 30-day 
readmissions (mFI-5 ≥2: OR 1.46; mFI-5 = 1: OR 1.18), and nonhome discharge
(mFI-5 ≥2: OR 1.80; mFI-5 = 1: OR 1.16). Higher mFI-5 score was significantly
associated with increased risks of superficial surgical site infection, deep
surgical site infection, unplanned reoperation, any medical complication,
pneumonia, unplanned intubation, postoperative ventilator use, progressive renal 
insufficiency, acute renal failure, urinary tract infection, stroke, myocardial
infarction, bleeding requiring transfusion, sepsis, and septic shock.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher mFI-5 scores were associated with increased postoperative
morbidity following elective 1- to 2-level posterior lumbar fusions.

PURPOSE: Compared with cast treatment, surgery may expose patients with distal
radius fractures to undue risk. Surgical intervention in this cohort may offer
less benefit than previously thought and appropriate patient selection is
imperative. The modified Frailty Index (mFI) predicts complications after other
orthopedic surgeries. We hypothesized that this index would predict, and might
ultimately prevent, complications in patients older than 50 years with distal
radius fractures.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the American College of Surgeons-National
Surgery Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database, including patients
older than 50 years who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of a
distal radius fracture. A 5-item mFI score was then calculated for each patient. 
Postoperative complications, readmission and reoperation rates, as well as length
of stay (LOS) were recorded. Bivariate and multivariable statistical analysis was
then performed.
RESULTS: We identified 6,494 patients (mean age, 65 years). Compared with
patients with mFI of 0, patients with mFI of 2 or greater were nearly 2.5 times
as likely to incur a postoperative complication (1.7% vs 7.4%). Specifically, the
rates of Clavien-Dindo IV, wound, cardiac, and renal complications were increased
significantly in patients with mFI of 2 or greater. In addition, as mFI increased
from 0 to 2 or greater, 30-day reoperation rate increased from 0.8% to 2.4%,
30-day readmission from 0.8% to 4.6%, and LOS from 0.5 days to 1.44 days. Frailty
was associated with increased complications as well as rates of readmission and
reoperation even when controlling for demographic data, LOS, and operative time. 
Age alone was not significantly associated with postoperative complications,
readmission, reoperation, or LOS.
CONCLUSIONS: A state of frailty is highly predictive of postoperative
complications, readmission, reoperation, and increased LOS following open
reduction and internal fixation of distal radius fractures. Our data suggest that
a simple frailty evaluation can help inform surgical decision making in patients 
older than 50 years with distal radius fractures.

Background  The burden of frail patients undergoing emergency general surgery
(EGS) is increasing rapidly and this population is particularly susceptible to
postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and mortality. We aimed to determine 
the association between frailty, as defined by the previously described modified 
frailty index (mFI), and postoperative respiratory complications (unplanned
reintubation, pneumonia, and prolonged ventilation), cardiac complications
(myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest), and mortality. We also sought to
identify the most significant determinants of frailty in the highest risk
patients based on the specific variables comprising the mFI. Methods  We
performed a retrospective observational analysis of the prospectively collected
American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program
database. Files from 2005 to 2015 identified 132,765 inpatients who underwent
EGS. mFI scores were calculated for each patient. The effect of increasing
frailty on unplanned reintubation, pneumonia, prolonged ventilation, myocardial
infarction, cardiac arrest, and mortality was evaluated using bivariate analysis.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare mFI with additional
predictor variables including race, gender, physical status as defined by the
American Society of Anesthesiologists, disseminated cancer, renal failure,
smoking status, sepsis, wound presence/classification, dyspnea, and previous
ventilator dependence. Results  Unplanned reintubation, pneumonia, prolonged
ventilation, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and mortality were
significantly associated with frailty, and the odds of each postoperative
complication increased with increasing mFI score. Of the frailest patients (mFI
≥3) that experienced cardiopulmonary complications or mortality, the variables of
the mFI that contributed most to frailty were hypertension requiring medication
and functional status before surgery. Conclusions  A higher mFI score is
associated with increased odds of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications and
mortality in the EGS population. Specific variables of the mFI can also provide
valuable information for assessing odds in the frailest patients undergoing EGS.

Importance: Frailty is a measure of decreased physiological reserve that is
associated with morbidity and mortality in major elective and emergency general
surgery operations, independent of chronological age. To date, the association of
frailty with outcomes in ambulatory general surgery has not been established.
Objective: To determine the association between frailty and perioperative
morbidity in patients undergoing ambulatory general surgery operations.
Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 
140 828 patients older than 40 years of age from the 2007-2010 American College
of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use File
who underwent ambulatory and 23-hour-stay hernia, breast, thyroid, or parathyroid
surgery. Data analysis was performed from August 18, 2016, to June 21, 2017.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The association between the National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program modified frailty index and perioperative morbidity was
determined via multivariable logistic regression with random-effects modeling to 
control for clustering within Current Procedural Terminology codes.
Results: A total of 140 828 patients (80 147 women and 60 681 men; mean [SD] age,
59.3 [12.0] years) underwent ambulatory hernia (n = 71 455), breast (n = 51 267),
thyroid, or parathyroid surgery (n = 18 106). Of these patients, 2457 (1.7%)
experienced any type of perioperative complication and 971 (0.7%) experienced
serious perioperative complications. An increasing modified frailty index was
associated with a stepwise increase in the incidence of complications. In
multivariable analysis adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, anesthesia type,
tobacco use, renal failure, corticosteroid use, and clustering by Current
Procedural Terminology codes, an intermediate modified frailty index score
(0.18-0.35, corresponding to 2-3 frailty traits) was associated with
statistically significant odds ratios of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.54-1.88; P < .001) for
any complication and 2.00 (95% CI, 1.72-2.34; P < .001) for serious
complications. A high modified frailty index score (≥0.36, corresponding to ≥4
frailty traits) was associated with statistically significant odds ratios of 3.35
(95% CI, 2.52-4.46; P < .001) for any complication and 3.95 (95% CI, 2.65-5.87;
P < .001) for serious complications. Anesthesia with local and monitored
anesthesia care was the only modifiable covariate associated with decreased odds 
of serious 30-day complications, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.66 (95% CI,
0.53-0.81; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: Frailty is associated with increased perioperative
morbidity in common ambulatory general surgery operations, independent of age,
type of anesthesia, and other comorbidities. Surgeons should consider frailty
rather than chronological age when counseling and selecting patients for elective
ambulatory surgery.

BACKGROUND: The effect of frailty on outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve
replacement (TAVR) remains incompletely understood. The objective of this study
was to evaluate the performance of four commonly used frailty markers as
predictors of early and late outcomes among patients undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: A review was performed of 361 high- and extreme-risk patients undergoing
TAVR from 2011 to 2015. Four frailty variables were assessed: serum albumin
(g/dL), 5-m walk (seconds), grip strength (kg), and Katz index of independence in
activities of daily living. Logistic regression was used to examine the
association between the frailty indicators and 30-day composite of mortality,
stroke, new heart block requiring permanent pacemaker, major or life-threatening 
bleeding, acute renal failure, major vascular complication, and 30-day
readmission rate. Minimum distance to the perfect point (0, 1) was performed to
delineate a cutoff point for each frailty indicator, and risk models were
compared using receiver-operating characteristics curves.
RESULTS: The composite of outcomes occurred in 28% of patients. Serum albumin,
activities of daily living, and 5-m walk were independent predictors for 30-day
composite outcomes, but only albumin was predictive of 30-day mortality. A new
frailty model (four frailty indicators, age, and sex) to predict 30-day mortality
was created and compared with The Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of 
mortality. Better discrimination was found with the new frailty model (area under
the curve 0.74 versus 0.58). New individual frailty variable cutoff values were
found to predict our composite of events.
CONCLUSIONS: Among high- and extreme-risk patients undergoing TAVR, our new
frailty model was more discriminative of 30-day mortality than The Society of
Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality. New cutoff values for frailty
indicators were identified and will require further validation.

Frailty is a common complication in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) under dialysis, which is a strong risk factor for low quality of life,
morbidity, and mortality. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of
frailty in a group of Portuguese ESRD patients, and its association with
socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. We performed a
cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3
[±14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients
as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire.
Social support, data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and
haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory
markers were also evaluated. Our results confirmed that frailty is a highly
prevalent condition in ESRD patients, particularly in female patients. An
association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of
hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.

INTRODUCTION: Failure-to-rescue (FTR) (defined as death from a major
complication) is considered as an index of hospital quality in trauma patients.
However, the role of frailty in FTR events remains unclear. We hypothesized that 
FTR rate is higher in elderly frail trauma patients.
METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of all elderly (age ≥ 65 years) 
trauma patients presenting at our level one trauma center. Patient's frailty
status was calculated utilizing the Trauma Specific Frailty Index (TSFI) within
24 hours of admission. Patients were stratified into non-frail, pre-frail, and
frail. FTR was defined as death from a major complication (respiratory,
infectious, cardiac, and renal). Binary logistic regression analysis was
performed after adjusting for age, gender, injury severity (ISS), and vital
parameters to assess the relationship between frailty status and FTR.
RESULTS: A total of 368 elderly trauma patients were evaluated of which 25% (n = 
93) were non-frail, 38% (n = 139) pre-frail, and 37% (n = 136) frail. Overall,
30% of the patients developed in-hospital complications; of them, mortality
occurred in 26% of the patients (FTR group). In the FTR group, 69% of the
patients were frail compared to 17% pre-frail and 14% non-frail (p = 0.002). On
multivariate regression analysis for predictors of FTR, frail status was an
independent predictor of FTR (OR [95% CI] = 2.67 [1.37-5.20]; p = 0.004). On
sensitivity analysis, positive predictive value of TSFI for FTR was 69% and
negative predictive value for FTR was 67%.
CONCLUSION: In elderly trauma patients, the presence of frailty increased the
odds of FTR almost threefold as compared to non-frail. Although FTR has been
considered as an indicator of health care quality, the findings of this study
suggest that frailty status independently contributes to FTR. This needs to be
considered in the future development of quality metrics, particularly in the case
of geriatric trauma patients.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a perioperative metastatic spinal
tumor frailty index (MSTFI) that could predict morbidity, mortality, and length
of stay.
METHODS: A large inpatient hospitalization database was searched from 2002 to
2011 to identify 4583 patients with spinal metastasis from breast (21.1%), lung
(34.1%), thyroid (3.8%), renal (19.9%), and prostate (21.1%) cancer who underwent
surgery. A multiple logistic regression model identified 9 independent parameters
that were used to construct the MSTFI: anemia, chronic lung disease,
coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary circulation disorders, renal
failure, malnutrition, emergent/urgent admission, and anterior/combined surgical 
approach. Patients with 0 points were categorized as "not frail," 1 as "mildly
frail," 2 as "moderately frail," and ≥3 as "severely frail."
RESULTS: The overall perioperative complication rate was 19.3% and in-patient
mortality was 3.0%. Compared with patients with no frailty, patients with
moderate frailty (odds ratio [OR] 5.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]
2.44-10.86), and severe frailty (OR 5.74; 95% CI 2.69-12.24) had significantly
increased odds of inpatient mortality (all P < 0.001). Similarly, patients with
mild frailty (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.33-2.66), moderate frailty (OR 3.83; 95% CI
2.71-5.41), and severe frailty (OR 6.97; 95% CI 4.98-9.74) had significantly
increased odds of developing a major in-hospital complication (all P < 0.001).
Length of stay also increased significantly by MSTFI (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In surgically treated patients with spinal metastasis, certain
perioperative parameters may significantly predict the risk of major in-hospital 
complications and mortality.

BACKGROUND: Patient-centered quality outcomes such as disposition after surgery
are increasingly being scrutinized. Preoperative factors predictive of nonhome
discharge (DC) may identify at-risk patients for targeted interventions. This
study examines the association among preoperative risk factors, frailty, and
nonhome DC after elective vascular surgery procedures in patients living at home.
METHODS: The 2011-2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Project database was
queried to identify all home-dwelling patients who underwent elective vascular
procedures (endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair, suprainguinal and
infrainguinal bypasses, peripheral endovascular interventions, carotid
endarterectomy, and stent). Preoperative frailty was measured using the modified 
frailty index (mFI; derived from Canadian Study of Health and Aging). Univariate 
and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the
association of frailty and nonhome DC.
RESULTS: Of 15,843 home-dwelling patients, 1,177 patients (7.4%) did not return
home postoperatively. Frailty (mFI > 0.25) conferred a significantly increased
2-fold risk of nonhome DC disposition for each procedure type. Frailty, female
gender, open procedures, increasing age, end-stage renal disease, and occurrence 
of any postoperative complication were associated with increased risk of nonhome 
DC. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, frailty increased the odds of
nonhome DC by 60% (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4-1.8) after
adjusting for other covariates. In the presence of complications, the risk of
nonhome DC was 27.5% in frail versus 16.5% in nonfrail patients (P < 0.001). In
the absence of complications, although absolute risk was lower, frail patients
were nearly twice as likely to not return home (frail 5.5% vs. nonfrail 2.75%,
P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail home-dwelling patients undergoing elective vascular procedures
are at high risk of not returning home after surgery. Preoperative frailty
assessment appears to hold potential for counseling regarding postsurgery
disposition and DC planning.

PURPOSE: Our objective was to determine the impact of preoperative frailty, as
measured by validated Risk Analysis Index (RAI), on the occurrence of
postoperative complications after urologic surgeries in a national database
comprised of diverse practice groups and cases.
STUDY DESIGN: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database 
was queried from 2005 to 2011 for a list of abdominal, vaginal, transurethral and
scrotal urological surgeries using Current Procedural Terminology codes. The
study population was subdivided into two groups based on the nature of procedures
performed: complex procedures (inpatient) and simple procedures (outpatient).
Risk Analysis Index score was calculated using preoperative NSQIP variables to
determine preoperative frailty. Major postoperative morbidities (pulmonary,
cardiovascular, renal and infectious), mortality, return to operating room,
discharge destination and readmission to the hospital were examined.
RESULTS: The study identified 42,715 patients who underwent urological
procedures, 25,693 complex and 17,022 simple procedures. Mean RAI score (range)
was 7.75 (0-53). The majority of patients scored low on the RAI (90.57 % with
RAI < 10). As the RAI score increased, there was a significant increase in
postoperative complication and mortality rate (both p < 0.0001). Similarly, the
rate of return to operating room and hospital readmission rate increased as RAI
increased (both p < 0.0001). Additionally, rate of discharge to home decreased.
Interestingly, mortality rate in patients with high RAI did not differ comparing 
simple to complex procedures (p = 0.90), whereas complications were significantly
greater in the complex operation (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Increase in frailty, as measured by RAI score, is associated with
increased postoperative complications and mortality. RAI may allow for rapid
identification and counseling of patients who are at high risk of adverse
perioperative outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility and safety of a
balloon-expandable, re-collapsible sheath for TAVR patients, including those with
small iliofemoral access (≤5.0 mm).
BACKGROUND: The recommended iliofemoral diameter for the CoreValve TAVR system is
≥6.0 mm, but the lowest limit has not been determined.
METHODS: Of 322 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR from 1/2014 to 8/2015 at 
two institutions, 64 underwent transfemoral CoreValve implantation, using an
11/19-French balloon-expandable, re-collapsible sheath, which has a 4.45 mm outer
diameter (OD) on arterial entry, expands to 7.67 mm, then re-collapses upon
removal. Valve sizing and vascular access were determined by computed tomography,
and outcomes were assessed using the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2
(VARC-2) definitions.
RESULTS: Thirteen of 64 patients had a minimal iliofemoral artery luminal
diameter (MLD) of ≤5.0 mm (mean 4.38+/-0.59 mm, range 3.1-5.0 mm), with vessel
calcification ≤90° to 360° and tortuosity <45° to >90°. At the MLD point, the
sheath-to-artery ratios, based on the fully expanded 7.67 mm OD, ranged
1.53-2.47, higher than previously reported ratios that risk vascular
complications. Major comorbidities included chronic renal failure, severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, extreme thrombocytopenia, cirrhosis, prior cardiac
surgery, poor ventricular function, and frailty. All 64 patients had TAVR with IV
sedation and local anesthesia, with 0% sheath malfunction, 0% vascular
complications, and 0% bleeding in-hospital and at 30 days per VARC-2 definitions.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR using a balloon-expandable, re-collapsible sheath is safe,
including in small iliofemoral access ≤5.0 mm, thus considerably expanding the
population suitable for transfemoral approach. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) is
increasingly performed in nonagenarians. There is scarce evidence on the
feasibility and safety of balloon-expandable TAVI in this patient population. A
total of 734 patients who underwent balloon-expandable TAVI at our institute were
included in the study. We compared 136 patients who were aged at least 90 years
at the time of TAVI (mean age 92.4 ± 2.4 years) with the remaining 598 younger
patients (mean age 79.7 ± 7.8 years). Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 end
points were compared between the 2 groups. Diabetes mellitus, coronary artery
disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and chronic lung disease were
significantly less prevalent in patients aged ≥90 years. In contrast, the
prevalence of frailty, chronic renal failure, and atrial fibrillation was
significantly higher in these patients. Device success was 96% in both groups.
All-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year was 2.9% and 12.5% versus 2.8% and
12.3% in patients aged ≥90 and <90, respectively (p = 0.95 for both). All major
complication rates were similar between groups. Nonagenarians had higher rates of
minor vascular complications (13.2% vs 7.7%; p = 0.04). In conclusion, performing
balloon-expandable TAVI in carefully selected group of nonagenarians is feasible 
and offers clinical benefit comparable to patients aged <90 years. Advanced age, 
in the absence of significant co-morbidities, should not deter clinicians from
evaluating patients for TAVI for severe AS.

BACKGROUND: Frailty, a multidimensional syndrome entailing loss of energy,
physical ability, cognition, and health, plays a significant role in elderly
morbidity and mortality. No study has examined frailty in relation to mortality
after femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We examined the association of a modified frailty index
abbreviated from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index to 1- and
2-year mortality rates after a femoral neck fracture. Specifically we examined:
(1) Is there an association of a modified frailty index with 1- and 2-year
mortality rates in patients aged 60 years and older who sustain a low-energy
femoral neck fracture? (2) Do the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
indicate that the modified frailty index can be a potential tool predictive of
mortality and does a specific modified frailty index value demonstrate increased 
odds ratio for mortality? (3) Do any of the individual clinical deficits
comprising the modified frailty index independently associate with mortality?
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 697 low-energy femoral neck fractures in
patients aged 60 years and older at our Level I trauma center from 2005 to 2009. 
A total of 218 (31%) patients with high-energy or pathologic fracture,
postoperative complication including infection or revision surgery, fracture of
the contralateral hip, or missing documented mobility status were excluded. The
remaining 481 patients, with a mean age of 81.2 years, were included. Mortality
data were obtained from a state vital statistics department using date of birth
and Social Security numbers. Statistical analysis included unequal variance
t-test, Pearson correlation of age and frailty, ROC curves and area under the
curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics, and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: One-year mortality analysis found the mean modified frailty index was
higher in patients who died (4.6 ± 1.8) than in those who lived (3.0 ± 2; p <
0.001), which was maintained in a 2-year mortality analysis (4.4 ± 1.8 versus 3.0
± 2; p < 0.001). In ROC analysis, the area under the curve was 0.74 and 0.72 for 
1- and 2-year mortality, respectively. Patients with a modified frailty index of 
4 or greater had an odds ratio of 4.97 for 1-year mortality and an odds ratio of 
4.01 for 2-year mortality as compared with patients with less than 4. Logistic
regression models demonstrated that the clinical deficits of mobility,
respiratory, renal, malignancy, thyroid, and impaired cognition were
independently associated with 1- and 2-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients aged 60 years and older sustaining a femoral neck fracture,
with a higher modified frailty index, had increased 1- and 2-year mortality
rates, and the ROC analysis suggests that this tool may be predictive of
mortality. Patients with a modified frailty index of 4 or greater have increased 
risk for mortality at 1 and 2 years. Clinical deficits of mobility, respiratory, 
renal, malignancy, thyroid, and impaired cognition also may be independently
associated with mortality. The modified frailty index may be a useful tool in
predicting mortality, guiding patient and family expectations and elucidating
implant/surgery choices. Further prospective studies are necessary to strengthen 
the predictive power of the index.

Displaced intracapsular fractures of the neck of femur are routinely treated in
the elderly with either cemented or uncemented hemiarthroplasty. Recent evidence 
suggests a superior outcome with the use of cement, but uncemented prostheses are
still employed for those with multiple co-morbidities or particular frailty. In
Scotland, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) recommendations 
are used to identify which patients should receive a cemented prosthesis. These
are simply based upon the presence of cardiorespiratory disease, particularly in 
the frail elderly patient. Between January 2007 and June 2010, a total of 1397
patients with neck-of-femur fractures presented to our unit. Retrospective
analysis was performed with particular attention given to the rate of
postoperative periprosthetic fracture. As many as 546 fractures were treated with
hemiarthroplasty, of which 183 were treated with a cemented Exeter Trauma Stem
(ETS) and 363 were treated with an uncemented Austin-Moore prosthesis (AMP). At
the time of our retrospective analysis, we found that 15 (4%) patients treated
with an uncemented prosthesis went on to sustain a periprosthetic fracture. There
were no periprosthetic fractures in the cemented group (p=0.004). Data analysis
by case-note review of those patients sustaining a periprosthetic fracture was
then performed. Seven (50%) suffered from confusion secondary to dementia, six
(43%) had a history of significant cardiac disease (recent myocardial infarction 
(MI) or cardiac failure) and two (14%) had known renal impairment. The mean time 
to fracture after uncemented hemiarthroplasty was 2 years. The majority (80%)
were fractures which required further surgery. Revision surgery in these patients
was associated with an overall complication rate of 42% (mainly deep infection
and haemorrhage requiring transfusion). Two of the patients had a fracture that
could be treated conservatively. It is concluded that, in conjunction with the
treating senior anaesthetist, cemented implants should be considered in all
patients, especially those who are deemed to be frail and with multiple
co-morbidities. A periprosthetic fracture rate of 14% at a mean of 2 years after 
uncemented hemiarthroplasty represents a potentially unacceptable risk for such a
frail population. In particular, we feel that the AMP should not be used for
treating displaced intracapsular neck-of-femur fractures.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) has a
positive predictive value for postoperative delirium (POD) after vascular
surgery.
METHODS: Between March and August 2010, 142 consecutive vascular surgery patients
were prospectively evaluated. Preoperatively, the GFI was obtained and
postoperatively patients were screened with the Delirium Observation Scale (DOS).
Patients with a DOS-score ≥3 points were assessed by a geriatrician. Delirium was
defined by the DSM-IV-TR criteria. Primary outcome variable was the incidence of 
POD. Secondary outcome variables were any surgical complication and hospital
length of stay (HLOS) (>7 days).
RESULTS: Ten patients (7%) developed POD. The highest incidence of POD was found 
after aortic surgery (17%) and amputation procedures (40%). Increased
comorbidities (p = 0.006), GFI score (p = 0.03), renal insufficiency (p = 0.04), 
elevated C-reactive protein (p = 0.008), high American Society of
Anaesthesiologists score (p = 0.05), a DOS-score of ≥3 points (p = 0.001),
post-operative intensive care unit admittance (p = 0.01) and HLOS ≥7 days (p =
0.005) were risk factors for POD. The GFI score was not associated with a
prolonged HLOS. A mean number of 2 ± 1 (range 0-5) complications were registered.
The receiver operator characteristics (ROC) area under the curve for the GFI was 
0.70.
CONCLUSIONS: The GFI can be helpful in the early identification of POD after
vascular surgery in a select group of high-risk patients.

Health-related quality of life outcomes in chronic kidney disease.

Pennsylvania 15213, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

[Physiopathology of the diabetic foot].

Diabetic foot ulcerations result from different physiopathological mechanisms; a 
clear understanding of them is crucial to reduce their incidence, provide early
care, and finally delay the amputation risk. The three main diabetes
complications involved in foot ulcerations are neuropathy, peripheral arterial
disease, and infection. The most common pathway to ulceration is peripheral
sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy, leading to loss of sensitivity, foot
deformities, high foot pressure, and dry skin. Peripheral arterial disease is
more frequent and more serious in the diabetic population. It delays
cicatrization and causes gangrene and finally amputation. Infection is also a
major complication of ulceration because of its risk of spreading into deep
tissue and bone, which increases the risk of amputation. Infection may also
generalize and become life-threatening. These complications preferentially affect
the foot because it is exposed to hyper pressure, neuropathy, and peripheral
arterial disease, which cause distal lesions, and the foot is exposed to a closed
atmosphere, a source of soaking and skin frailty. Diabetes itself may enhance the
risk of complications stemming from the disease's long-term progression and poor 
glucose control, thereby affecting ocular and renal functions. Finally, some
psychosocial situations such as depression syndrome or poor hygiene possibly
enhance diabetic foot occurrence.
