This study aims to analyze the impact of frailty, multimorbidity and disability
on the survival of elderly people attended in a geriatric outpatient facility,
and identify the clinical risk factors associated with death. It is a
longitudinal study, with 133 elderly people initially evaluated in relation to
frailty, multimorbidity (simultaneous presence of three or more chronic diseases)
and disability in Daily Life Activities. The Kaplan Meier method was used to
analyze survival time, and the Cox regression was used for association of the
clinical factors with death. In follow-up over six years, 21.2% of the
participants died, survival being lowest among those who were fragile (p < 0.05).
The variables frailty (HR = 2.26; CI95%: 1.03-4.93) and Chronic Renal
Insufficiency (HR = 3.00; CI95%: 1.20-7.47) were the factors of highest risk for 
death in the multivariate analysis. Frailty had a negative effect on the survival
of these patients, but no statistically significant association was found in
relation to multimorbidity or disability. Tracking of vulnerabilities in the
outpatient geriatric service is important, due to the significant number of
elderly people with geriatric syndromes that use this type of service, and the
taking of decisions on directions for care of these individuals.

Publisher: O objetivo deste estudo foi analisar o impacto da fragilidade, da
multimorbidade e da incapacidade funcional na sobrevida de idosos assistidos em
ambulatório de geriatria e identificar os fatores clínicos de risco associados ao
óbito. Estudo longitudinal, com 133 idosos avaliados inicialmente em relação à
fragilidade, multimorbidade (presença simultânea de 3 doenças crônicas ou mais) e
perda funcional nas Atividades de Vida Diária. Utilizou-se o método Kaplan Meier,
para a análise de sobrevida, e a regressão de Cox, para a associação dos fatores 
clínicos com o óbito. Após seguimento de seis anos, 21,2% dos participantes
faleceram, sendo a sobrevida menor entre os idosos frágeis (p < 0,05). As
variáveis fragilidade (HR = 2,26; IC95%: 1,03-4,93) e Insuficiência Renal Crônica
(HR = 3,00; IC95%: 1,20-7,47) foram fatores de maiores riscos para óbito na
análise multivariada. A fragilidade impactou negativamente na sobrevida desses
pacientes, porém não foi observada associação estatisticamente significativa em
relação à multimorbidade e perda funcional. O rastreio de vulnerabilidades no
serviço ambulatorial de geriatria é relevante, em virtude do número expressivo de
idosos portadores de síndromes geriátricas que utilizam este tipo de atendimento 
e do direcionamento dos cuidados desses indivíduos.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frailty and depression both contribute to malnutrition and
adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, their
interaction is incompletely defined.
METHODS: We studied 178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed 
by a validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by the
Geriatric Depression Scale; nutritional status was determined by subjective
global assessment (SGA) and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS). All patients
were followed for up to 24 months for survival and hospitalization analysis.
RESULTS: There were 111 patients (62.4%) physically frail, amongst those 48
(43.2%) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without
frailty. There was an additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty
on nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty, frail but no depressive
symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin decreased in a
stepwise manner (35.8 ± 5.6, 34.9 ± 4.4, and 32.9 ± 5.3 g/L, respectively,
p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 ± 0.61, 5.41 ± 0.59, and 5.04 ± 0.77,
respectively (p< 0.0001), and MIS was 5.12 ± 2.30, 7.13 ± 3.22, and 9.48 ± 3.97, 
respectively (p< 0.0001). At 24 months, patient survival was 86.6%, 71.4%, and
62.5% for patients with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail
with depressive symptoms, respective (p=0.001). The median number of hospital
stay was 8.04 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.91 - 19.42), 14.05 (IQR 3.57 -
37.27), and 26.62 (IQR 10.65 - 61.18) days per year of follow up, respectively
(p< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Physical frailty and depressive symptoms are both common in Chinese
PD patients, and they have additive adverse effect on the nutritional status and 
clinical outcome.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cognitive and renal impairment are pervasive among elderly
frails, a high-risk, geriatric sub-population with peculiar clinical
characteristics. In a series of frail individuals with non-advanced chronic
kidney disease (CKD), we aimed at assessing the entity of functional, general
health and cognitive impairment and the possible relationship between these types
of dysfunction and the severity of renal impairment.
METHODS: 2229 geriatric subjects were screened for frailty and CKD. Severity of
CKD was assessed by eGFR (CKD-EPI formula). Frailty was established by the Fried 
Index. Functional, general health and cognitive status were assessed by validated
score measures.
RESULTS: Final analysis included 271 frail CKD subjects (162 women, 109 men).
Mean eGFR was 64.25 ± 25.04 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD
(stage 3-4) was 44%. Twenty-six percent of patients had severe cognitive
impairment, while mild and moderate impairment was found in 7 and 67% of
individuals, respectively. All subjects had poor functional and general health
status. Cognitive capacities significantly decreased across CKD stages (p for
trend < 0.0001). In fully adjusted multivariate analyses, cognitive status
remained an independent predictor of eGFR (β = 0.465; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mild-to-moderate CKD is highly pervasive among frail elderly
individuals and the severity of renal dysfunction is independently correlated
with that of cognitive impairment. Future studies are advocated to clarify
whether the combination of kidney and mental dysfunction may portend a higher
risk of worsen outcomes in this high-risk population.

Purpose: Recent evidence supports the prognostic significance of frailty for
functional decline and poor health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney
disease. Yet, despite the development of clinical tools to screen for frailty,
little is known about the experiential impact of screening for frailty in this
setting. The Frailty Assessment for Care Planning Tool (FACT) evaluates frailty
across 4 domains: mobility, function, social circumstances, and cognition. The
purpose of this qualitative study was as follows: 1) explore the nurse experience
of screening for frailty using the FACT tool in a specialized outpatient renal
clinic; 2) determine how, if at all, provider perceptions of frailty changed
after implementation of the frailty screening tool; and 3) determine the
perceived factors that influence uptake and administration of the FACT screening 
tool in a specialized clinical setting.
Methods: A semi-structured interview of 5 nurses from the Nova Scotia Health
Authority, Central Zone Renal Clinic was conducted. A grounded theory approach
was used to generate thematic categories and analysis models.
Results: Four primary themes emerged in the data analysis: "we were skeptical",
"we made it work", "we learned how", and "we understand". As the renal nurses
gained a sense of confidence in their ability to implement the FACT tool, initial
barriers to implementation were attenuated. Implementation factors - such as
realistic goals, clear guidelines, and ongoing training - were important factors 
for successful uptake of the frailty screening initiative.
Conclusion: Nurse participants reported an overall positive experience using the 
FACT method to screen for frailty and indicated that their understanding of the
multiple dimensions and subtleties of "frailty" were enhanced. Future nurse-led
FACT screening initiatives should incorporate those factors identified as being
integral to program success: realistic goals, clear guidelines, and ongoing
training. Adopting the evaluation of frailty as a priority within clinical
departments will encourage sustainability.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of frailty and
the association of vitamin D levels and the frailty phenotype among non-geriatric
dialysis patients.
METHOD: Seventy-four stable, chronic hemodialysis patients from the hemodialysis 
unit of the hospital were enrolled in the study. The patients' medical histories 
and laboratory findings were obtained from the medical records of the dialysis
unit. Serum parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were determined
using chemiluminometric immunoassays. Frailty was defined by Fried et al. as a
phenotype; shrinking, weakness, self-reported exhaustion, decreased activity and 
slowed walking speed were evaluated.
RESULTS: Forty-one (55%) of the patients were males. The patients were divided
into 3 groups according to frailty scores: 39 (53%) patients were frail, 6 (8%)
patients were intermediately frail, and 28 (39%) patients were normal.
Significant differences were found for 25-hydroxy vitamin D and hemoglobin levels
among the groups; however, no differences were observed in body mass index,
comorbidities, sex, marital status, education, disease and dialysis durations, or
parathyroid hormone, creatinine, serum calcium, phosphorus, and potassium levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Weakness and slowness are serious outcomes of both vitamin D
deficiency and frailty, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with
increased risks of decreased physical activity, falls, fractures and death in
postmenopausal women and older men. Although studies on frailty have focused on
older adults, growing evidence indicates that the frailty phenotype is becoming a
factor associated with poor health outcomes in non-geriatric populations with
chronic disease.

Objectives The clinical condition of frailty is a common problem in the elderly
population. However, the relationship between peripheral artery disease and
frailty in hemodialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to
identify the relationships between peripheral artery disease and frailty in
Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods A total of 362 chronic
hemodialysis patients who regularly visited six institutions were enrolled. To
evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty phenotype adjusted for Japanese
were used. Peripheral artery disease was defined as ankle-brachial index <0.9.
Results Of 362 patients, 62 patients (17.1%) were categorized as peripheral
artery disease group and 300 patients (82.9%) as Non-peripheral artery disease
group. The prevalence of frailty in the peripheral artery disease group was
significantly higher than in the Non-peripheral artery disease group (34% vs.
18%, P = 0.0103). Non-shunt side grip strength was significantly stronger in the 
Non-peripheral artery disease group (23.6 kg vs. 17.0 kg, P < 0.0001). Thigh
circumferences were also significantly larger in the Non-peripheral artery
disease group (41.7 cm vs. 39.7 cm, P = 0.0054). A multivariate logistic
regression analysis demonstrated that the factors independently associated with
peripheral artery disease were as follows: frailty (odds ratio = 2.06, 95%
confidence interval 1.09-3.89) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 3.74, 95% 
confidence interval 2.05-6.83). Conclusions It is concluded that peripheral
artery disease is closely associated with frailty in hemodialysis patients.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcopenia and muscle weakness contribute to fragility and
limit exercise tolerance among patients with CKD. This review focuses on the role
of reduction in mitochondrial mass and function in the myopathy associated with
CKD, causes for these muscle mitochondrial abnormalities, and potential
therapeutic interventions that may improve mitochondrial biogenesis and function 
as well as skeletal muscle function and performance in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial structure, function, and
composition have been shown in both experimental models and patients with CKD. A 
significant reduction in mitochondrial respiratory function and an increase in
mitochondrial complex 1 enzyme activity has been demonstrated in the muscle
tissue of male Sprague-Dawley rats following 5/6 nephrectomy. These changes were 
associated with a substantial reduction in skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass. In
patients with CKD, in-vivo magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy show
significantly elevated resting skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and lower mean 
mitochondrial coupling ratio indicating disrupted muscle mitochondrial metabolism
and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Skeletal muscle biopsies from
patients with advanced CKD show lower mitochondrial volume density and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number than controls.
SUMMARY: Advanced CKD is associated with decreased exercise capacity, skeletal
muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. Impaired mitochondrial respiratory function,
reduced muscle mitochondrial mass, and decreased energy production in skeletal
muscle play a critical role in this 'acquired mitochondrial myopathy' of CKD. It 
is reasonable, therefore, to develop therapeutic interventions that enhance
mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as skeletal muscle function and
performance in patients with CKD.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between serum β2-microglobulin (B2M) levels
and frailty in an elderly Chinese population.
DESIGN: A population-based cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data on 1,663 elderly participants (aged 70-84 
years) from the aging arm of the Rugao Longevity and Ageing study, a
population-based observational two-arm cohort study conducted in Rugao, China.
MEASUREMENTS: The serum B2M was measured with chemiluminescence immunoassay by a 
technician in the biochemistry laboratory of the Rugao People's Hospital.
Information on the frailty index and phenotype was collected.
RESULTS: The mean B2M levels and frailty index were 1.8 mg/L and 0.16,
respectively; 188 (11.3%) participants were classified as frail (frailty
phenotype). For a standard deviation increase in B2M, the adjusted odds ratio for
frailty phenotype was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.39; P=0.009) and the standardized
coefficient for frailty index was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.11; P=0.004). Relative to
the lowest quartile, the highest B2M quartile had a greater risk of prevalent
frailty with adjusted odds ratios of 1.68 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.71; P=0.034) for
frailty phenotype and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.27; P=0.044) for frailty index
(≥0.25). In addition, estimated glomerular filtration rate (based on B2M) or
chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
was significantly associated with frailty phenotype and index.
CONCLUSION: B2M was significantly associated with both frailty phenotype and
index in elderly Chinese population. The findings underscore the promising kidney
relevant biomarkers for identifying vulnerable elderly Chinese population.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of physical 
activity on various aspects in Asian dialysis patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Study participants were recruited
from 27 hospitals or dialysis centers in Korea (n = 1611). The participants were 
divided into 3 groups according to the degree of regular exercise: Inactive
group, Intermediate group, and Active group.
RESULTS: The proportions of patients with frailty and the presence of each
component decreased as physical activity increased. The presence and numbers of
disabilities decreased as physical activity increased. The number of participants
with a history of fall during the last 12 months was 149 (20.5%) in the Inactive 
group, 88 (16.9%) in the Intermediate group, and 48 (13.2%) in the Active group. 
Physical component scale and mental component scale scores increased as physical 
activity increased. The survival rate for all-cause death at 500 days was 95.5%
in the Active group, 95.2% in the Intermediate group, and 93.5% in the Inactive
group.
CONCLUSION: High physical activity was associated with favorable results for most
health-related quality of life scale scores, including frailty, disability, and
exhaustion, in Korean dialysis patients.

BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness is a risk factor for mortality in hemodialysis (HD)
patients. Muscle strength measurements are routinely used as a screening tool but
depend on patient cooperation and motivation. We wished to determine whether
measuring maximal voluntary muscle strength was affected by patient self-reported
distress.
METHODS: We measured pinch strength (PS) and handgrip strength (HGS) in 382 adult
HD patients with a corresponding self-reported distress thermometer (DT) scores. 
Postdialysis body composition measurements were made using multifrequency
bioelectrical assessments and patients assessed for frailty.
RESULTS: Mean age was 66.4 ± 14.9 years, with 238 males (62%), 48% diabetic, and 
dialysis vintage 36 (15-75) months. The mean DT score was 4.4 ± 3.3, with a
frailty score of 4.6 ± 1.5. On multivariable analysis, DT scores were associated 
with frailty (β = 0.35, P = .003), prescription of aspirin for cardiac disease (β
= 1.0, P = .004), lean body mass (β = 0.04, P = .004), and negatively with age (β
= -0.05, P < .001), hematocrit (β = -8.2, P = .004), and maximum PS (β = -1.4, P 
= .003).
CONCLUSION: Paradoxically higher self-reported DT scores were associated with
younger age and lean body mass. As such, younger healthier, rather than more
comorbid, patients may have greater expectations for their health and therefore
report more distress. We found no association between DT scores and HGS, and as
such, although HGS is a voluntary test, it appears to be a robust test
independent of patient stresses. However, PS was lower in patients with higher DT
scores, and as such, greater care may be required in interpreting these
measurements.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is highly prevalent in the dialysis population and is 
associated with mortality. Recent studies have suggested that other dialysis
outcomes are compromised in frail individuals. While we do not yet have a
consensus as to the best measure of frailty, identification of these poor
outcomes and their magnitude of association with frailty will help improve
prognostication, allow for earlier interventions, and improve provider-to-patient
communication.
RECENT FINDINGS: The most widely used assessment of frailty is Fried's physical
performance criteria. However, regardless of assessment method, frailty remains
highly associated with mortality. More recently, frailty has been associated with
falls, fractures, cognitive impairment, vascular access failure, and poor quality
of life. Recent large cohort studies provide strong evidence that frailty
assessment can provide important prognostic information for providers and
patients both before and after initiation of dialysis. Trials aimed at improving 
frailty are limited and show the promise of augmenting quality of life, although 
more studies are needed to firmly establish mortality benefits.
SUMMARY: We underscore the importance of frailty as a prognostic indicator and
identify other recently established consequences of frailty. Widespread adoption 
of frailty assessment remains limited and researchers continue to find ways of
simplifying the data collection process. Timely and regular assessment of frailty
may allow for interventions that can mitigate the onset of poor outcomes and
identify actionable targets for dialysis providers.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A geriatric assessment is an appropriate method for
identifying frail elderly patients. In CKD, it may contribute to optimize
personalized care. However, a geriatric assessment is time consuming. The purpose
of our study was to compare easy to apply frailty screening tools with the
geriatric assessment in patients eligible for dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 123 patients on
incident dialysis ≥65 years old were included <3 weeks before to ≤2 weeks after
dialysis initiation, and all underwent a geriatric assessment. Patients with
impairment in two or more geriatric domains on the geriatric assessment were
considered frail. The diagnostic abilities of six frailty screening tools were
compared with the geriatric assessment: the Fried Frailty Index, the Groningen
Frailty Indicator, Geriatric8, the Identification of Seniors at Risk, the
Hospital Safety Program, and the clinical judgment of the nephrologist. Outcome
measures were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
predictive value.
RESULTS: In total, 75% of patients were frail according to the geriatric
assessment. Sensitivity of frailty screening tools ranged from 48% (Fried Frailty
Index) to 88% (Geriatric8). The discriminating features of the clinical judgment 
were comparable with the other screening tools. The Identification of Seniors at 
Risk screening tool had the best discriminating abilities, with a sensitivity of 
74%, a specificity of 80%, a positive predictive value of 91%, and a negative
predictive value of 52%. The negative predictive value was poor for all tools,
which means that almost one half of the patients screened as fit (nonfrail) had
two or more geriatric impairments on the geriatric assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: All frailty screening tools are able to detect geriatric impairment 
in elderly patients eligible for dialysis. However, all applied screening tools, 
including the judgment of the nephrologist, lack the discriminating abilities to 
adequately rule out frailty compared with a geriatric assessment.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

Renal disease is a common health condition that leads to loss of physical
function, frailty, and premature loss of independence in addition to other severe
comorbidities and increased mortality. Increased levels of physical activity and 
initiation of exercise training is recommended in the current guidelines for all 
patients with renal disease, but participation and adherence rates are low. The
barriers to exercise and physical activity in patients with renal disease are not
well defined and currently based on patient provider perception and opinion.
There have been no published reviews that have synthesized published findings on 
patient reported barriers to exercise. This integrative literature review
therefore aimed to identify the current understanding of patient reported
barriers to regular exercise. This integrative review found that patient
perceived barriers to exercise are not consistent with the barriers that have
been identified by renal disease specialists and healthcare providers, which were
disinterest, lack of motivation, and being incapable of exercise. The patient
reported barriers identified through this review were complex and diverse, and
the most frequently reported patient perceived barrier to exercise was low energy
levels and fatigue. It is clear that additional research to identify patient
perceived barriers to exercise is needed and that patient directed interventions 
to address these barriers should be developed. This integrative review provides
information to the interdisciplinary nephrology team that can be used to tailor
their assessment of barriers to exercise and provide exercise education for
patients with renal disease.

BACKGROUND: Predicting outcomes in those with chronic kidney disease or following
transplantation is challenging, and current models lack detailed patient-level
information. Frailty and poor functional status are risk factors for adverse
patient outcomes that may be useful additions to prognostic tools in patients
with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine 
whether frailty or functional status are associated with increased risk of
mortality or adverse clinical outcomes in patients with advanced kidney disease.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review to identify and evaluate
studies linking frailty and functional status with patient outcomes in
populations with advanced kidney disease. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, and the
Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials. Two reviewers will conduct all
screening and data extraction independently. A modified version of the Quality In
Prognosis Studies tool will be used to evaluate the quality of the studies. If
meta-analysis of outcome data is possible, a random effects model will be used.
DISCUSSION: The results of this review will inform the development, selection,
and validation of appropriate metrics needed to improve prognostication in
patients with chronic kidney disease.

INTRODUCTION: This article ponders upon wearable medical measurement devices in
relation to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its' associated comorbidities - and 
whether these might benefit CKD-patients. We aimed to map the intersection(s) of 
nephrology and wearable sensor technology to help technologists understand
medical aspects, and clinicians to understand technological possibilities that
are available (or soon will become so). Areas covered: A structured literature
search on main comorbidities and complications CKD patients suffer from, was used
to steer mini-reviews on wearable sensor technologies clustered around 3 themes
being: Cardiovascular-related, diabetes-related and physical fitness/frailty.
This review excludes wearable dialysis - although also strongly enabled by
miniaturization - because that highly important theme deserves separate in-depth 
reviewing. Expert commentary: Continuous progress in integrated electronics
miniaturization enormously lowered price, size, weight and energy consumption of 
electronic sensors, processing power, memory and wireless connectivity. These
combined factors boost opportunities for wearable medical sensors. Such devices
can be regarded as enablers for: Remote monitoring, influencing human behaviour
(exercise, dietary), enhanced home care, remote consults, patient education and
peer networks. However, to make wearable medical devices succeed, the challenge
to fit them into health care structures will be dominant over the challenge to
realize the bare technologies themselves.

BACKGROUND: Survival for patients commencing renal replacement therapy is around 
90% in the first year and 83% at two years after starting dialysis. The factors
that appear to predict mortality are comorbidity and frailty associated with
kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate, age and biochemical factors.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse the condition of patients starting renal replacement
therapy, based on biomarkers commonly used in clinical practice and their
association with mortality, measured 6 and 12 months after initiating replacement
therapy.
METHODS: A one-year prospective follow-up study with 189 patients.
Sociodemographic variables, aetiology of renal disease, comorbidities, prior
nephrology service monitoring, prior renal transplantation and biochemical
parameters at the time of initiating replacement therapy were analysed.
RESULTS: The overall percentage of death during the one-year follow-up was 6.87%,
with 64% of deaths occurring during the first six months. The only variable
independently associated with mortality was low albumin levels.
CONCLUSION: Although most patients in this centre are monitored by a nephrologist
prior to starting replacement therapy, many nevertheless fail to achieve the
biochemical targets recommended. One such parameter is albumin, which proved at
the start of replacement therapy to be an independent predictor of mortality.
Findings of this study show the need to intervene on certain biochemical
parameters during the pre-dialysis stage and at the start of dialysis, in order
to improve survival in this group of patients.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered a model of accelerated aging. More
specifically, CKD leads to reduced physical functioning and increased frailty,
increased vascular dysfunction, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness,
high levels of systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased 
cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence suggests that the cognitive impairment 
associated with CKD may be related to cerebral small vessel disease and overall
impairment in white matter integrity. The triad of poor physical function,
vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment places patients living with CKD at
an increased risk for loss of independence, poor health-related quality of life, 
morbidity, and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the available 
evidence of cerebrovascular-renal axis and its interconnection with early and
accelerated cognitive impairment in patients with CKD and the plausible role of
exercise as a therapeutic modality. Understanding the cerebrovascular-renal axis 
pathophysiological link and its interconnection with physical function is
important for clinicians in order to minimize the risk of loss of independence
and improve quality of life in patients with CKD.

Patients with chronic kidney disease experience substantial loss of muscle mass, 
weakness, and poor physical performance. As kidney disease progresses, skeletal
muscle dysfunction forms a common pathway for mobility limitation, loss of
functional independence, and vulnerability to disease complications. Screening
for those at high risk for mobility disability by self-reported and objective
measures of function is an essential first step in developing an
interdisciplinary approach to treatment that includes rehabilitative therapies
and counseling on physical activity. Exercise has beneficial effects on systemic 
inflammation, muscle, and physical performance in chronic kidney disease. Kidney 
health providers need to identify patient and care delivery barriers to exercise 
in order to effectively counsel patients on physical activity. A thorough medical
evaluation and assessment of baseline function using self-reported and objective 
function assessment is essential to guide an effective individualized exercise
prescription to prevent function decline in persons with kidney disease. This
review focuses on the impact of kidney disease on skeletal muscle dysfunction in 
the context of the disablement process and reviews screening and treatment
strategies that kidney health professionals can use in clinical practice to
prevent functional decline and disability.

Frailty is a distinct phenotype that is highly prevalent in chronic kidney
disease (CKD) and appears to be more prevalent with decreasing glomerular
filtration rate. Exercise training or intervention to increase physical activity 
may ameliorate poor physical functioning and frailty, and even may improve
survival in patients with CKD. Although exercise interventions improve outcomes
across the spectrum of CKD, including patients treated with dialysis, patients
treated with dialysis face barriers to exercise that patients with predialysis
CKD do not. Rehabilitation at earlier stages of CKD (or prehabilitation before
dialysis) might be more beneficial than not addressing the decreasing physical
functioning and low physical activity until patients are receiving dialysis. This
review summarizes available literature on frailty in the CKD and end-stage renal 
disease population, including exercise interventions and the limited evidence for
prehabilitation as a strategy.

BACKGROUND: The risk of incorrect medication dosing is high in frail older
people. Therefore, accurate assessment of the glomerular filtration rate is
important.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the estimated glomerular
filtration rate using creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae, the Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, in frail older
people. We hypothesized that frailty determines the difference between the
creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae.
METHODS: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C was
determined using (cross-sectional) data of 55 patients (mean age 73 years)
admitted to a psychiatric ward for older adults. The level of agreement of these 
estimations was assessed by a Bland-Altman analysis. In all patients, the
Rockwood's Frailty Index was derived and correlated with the mean difference
between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C.
RESULTS: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine (mean
71.2 mL/min/1.73 m2) and CKD-EPI cystatin C (mean 57.6 mL/min/1.73 m2) was
13.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.0001). The two standard deviation limit in the
Bland-Altman plot was large (43.2 mL/min/1.73 m2), which represents a low level
of agreement. The Frailty Index did not correlate with the mean difference
between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based glomerular filtration rate (Pearson 
correlation coefficient 0.182, p = 0.184).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant gap between a creatinine- and cystatin
C-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate, irrespective of frailty. The
range of differences between the commonly used estimated glomerular filtration
rate formulae might result in clinically relevant differences in drug
prescription and differences in chronic kidney disease staging.

Background: The burden of chronic kidney disease is highest among older adults
but the significance of a diminished level of kidney function in this
heterogeneous population is poorly understood. We sought to examine the
relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and objective
physical performance in older adults.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 4,562 participants from The Irish
Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a national cohort of community-dwelling adults aged
≥50 years. We used multivariable linear or quantile regression to model the
association between categories of cystatin C (eGFRcys) or creatinine eGFR
(eGFRcr) and the following outcomes: gait speed, timed-up-and-go (TUG) and grip
strength. Relationships were further explored using natural eGFR splines. We
examined effect modification by age in the relationship between eGFR and gait
speed.
Results: Mean (SD) age was 61.8 (8.3) years, 53.6% were female and median (IQR)
eGFRcys was 82 (70-94) mL/min/1.73m2. In multivariable-adjusted models,
participants in the lowest eGFRcys category (< 45 mL/min/1.73m2) had 3.32 cm/s
(95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.02-6.62) slower mean gait speed, 1.32 kg
(95%CI 0.20-2.44) lower mean grip strength, and 0.31 seconds (95% CI -0.04 to
0.65) longer median TUG versus the reference group (eGFRcys ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2). 
The relationship between eGFRcys and outcomes appeared linear but varied by age. 
The association between eGFRcr and outcomes tended towards a U-shape.
Conclusions: Cystatin C eGFR was linearly related to poorer physical performance 
beyond middle age among community-dwelling adults. The non-linear relationships
observed with eGFRcr underscore the limitations of creatinine as a predictor of
frailty outcomes in older individuals.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review sarcopenia in chronic kidney
disease (CKD). We aim to present how definitions of sarcopenia from the general
population may pertain to those with CKD, its assessment by clinicians and
emerging therapies for sarcopenia in CKD. For this review, we limit our
description and recommendations to patients with CKD who are not on dialysis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Poorer parameters of lean mass, strength and physical function
are associated with worsening patient-centered outcomes such as limiting
mobility, falls and mortality in CKD; however, the magnitude of these
associations are different in those with and without CKD. Sarcopenia in CKD is a 
balance between skeletal muscle regeneration and catabolism, which are both
altered in the uremic environment. Multiple pathways are involved in these
derangements, which are briefly reviewed. Differences between commonly used terms
cachexia, frailty, protein-energy wasting, dynapenia and sarcopenia are
described. Therapeutic options in predialysis CKD are not well studied;
therefore, we review exercise options and emerging pharmacological therapies.
SUMMARY: Sarcopenia, now with its own International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision (ICD-10) code, is of importance clinically and should be accounted 
for in research studies in patients with CKD. Multiple therapies for sarcopenia
are in development and will hopefully be available for our patients in the
future.

It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased
postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease 
who underwent lower extremity surgical revascularization; however, outcomes after
peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) are less well established. This study
sought to determine the impact of CKD on adverse outcomes in patients with
peripheral artery disease who underwent PVI. Using data from the Veteran Affairs 
Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System Program, we identified a
cohort of 755 patients who underwent lower extremity PVI from June 2005 to August
2010 at 33 sites. The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to
dialysis, myocardial infarction, limb amputation, and stroke. Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard frailty models assessed the
association between CKD and adverse outcomes. Of the patients who underwent lower
extremity PVI, 201 patients (27%) had CKD. The presence of CKD was associated
with decreased survival (5-year survival probability of CKD compared with
non-CKD: 49.9% [41.6% to 59.9%] vs 80.1% [76.2% to 84.1]), which persisted after 
risk adjustment (HR 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.19). In addition,
there was a significant association between CKD and progression to dialysis (HR
6.62; 95% confidence interval 2.25 to 19.43). In contrast, there was no
association between CKD and re-hospitalization for myocardial infarction, limb
amputation, or stroke. In conclusion, CKD is present in 1 of 4 patients who
underwent PVI and is associated with increased risk of mortality and progression 
to dialysis.

The scope of this article is to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors
associated with the frailty of elderly people with chronic kidney disease on
hemodialysis. This involved a correlational, cross-sectional study conducted in a
dialysis center in the state of São Paulo. The sample consisted of 60
participants. The Participant Characterization Instrument was used for extracting
sociodemographic and clinical data and the Edmonton Frail Scale was used to
evaluate the level of frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
identify the factors associated with frailty. The mean age of the 60 patients
included was 71.1 (± 6.9) years, predominantly male (70%), of which 36.7% were
classified as frail. With respect to the factors associated with frailty among
the variables of gender, age, self-reported skin color, schooling, monthly per
capita income, hemodialysis time, number of associated diseases, falls in the
year, hematocrit level, parathyroid hormone and use of calcitriol, it was found
that only the monthly per capita income was significantly associated with frailty
(OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.1-0.9; p = 0.04). There was an association between frailty
and income, showing that the elderly most at risk of frailty were those with
lower income.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is associated with increased vulnerability to poor health.
There is growing interest in understanding the association between frailty and
chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review explored how frailty is
measured in patients with CKD and the association between frailty and adverse
outcomes across different stages of renal impairment.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic analysis of peer reviewed articles.
DATA SOURCES: Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane were used to identify 
the articles.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Articles published before the 17th of September 2016, that
measured frailty in patients with CKD was eligible for the systematic review. Two
independent researchers assessed the eligibility of the articles. Quality of the 
articles was assessed using the Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 540 articles, of which 32 met the study
criteria and were included in the review (n=36,076, age range: 50-83 years).
Twenty-three (72%) studies used or adapted the Fried phenotype to measure
frailty. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 7% in community-dwellers (CKD
Stages 1-4) to 73% in a cohort of patients on haemodialysis. The incidence of
frailty increased with reduced glomerular filtration rate. Frailty was associated
with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is prevalent in patients with CKD and it is associated with
an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. There are differences in the
methods used to assess frailty and this hinders comparisons between studies.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older
adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive
impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of
life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in
increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in
hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients 
with pre-dialysis CKD.
METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385
patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated 
tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive
frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial.
Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of ≤24. We determined the
prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages 
G4-G5, not on dialysis.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5
had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control
group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most
pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function 
(p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of
stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment
in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects
of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of
cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes
deserves further study.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney
function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in
community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level,
and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0
(normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Frailty status
was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle
weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of
having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were more frail
(odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition,
individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or
hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of
frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. 
Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty 
in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI
1.13-14.1) CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a
higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Geriatr

Dysregulation of skeletal remodeling is a component of renal osteodystrophy.
Previously, we showed that activin receptor signaling is differentially affected 
in various tissues in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether a ligand
trap for the activin receptor type 2A (RAP-011) is an effective treatment of the 
osteodystrophy of the CKD-mineral bone disorder. With a 70% reduction in the
glomerular filtration rate, CKD was induced at 14 weeks of age in the ldlr-/-
high fat-fed mouse model of atherosclerotic vascular calcification and diabetes. 
Twenty mice with CKD, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated
activin A were treated with RAP-011, wherease 19 mice were given vehicle twice
weekly from week 22 until the mice were killed at 28 weeks of age. The animals
were then evaluated by skeletal histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography,
mechanical strength testing, and ex vivo bone cell culture. Results in the CKD
groups were compared with those of the 16 sham-operated ldlr-/- high fat-fed
mice. Sham-operated mice had low-turnover osteodystrophy and skeletal frailty.
CKD stimulated bone remodeling with significant increases in osteoclast and
osteoblast numbers and bone resorption. Compared with mice with CKD
and sham-operated mice, RAP-011 treatment eliminated the CKD-induced increase in 
these histomorphometric parameters and increased trabecular bone fraction.
RAP-011 significantly increased cortical bone area and thickness. Activin
A-enhanced osteoclastogenesis was mediated through p-Smad2 association with c-fos
and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Thus, an
ActRIIA ligand trap reversed CKD-stimulated bone remodeling, likely through
inhibition of activin-A induced osteoclastogenesis.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent in the United States and
throughout the world,(1) with approximately 13% of adults affected.(2) In
addition, according to recent estimates, almost half of patients with CKD stages 
3 to 5 are 70 years of age and older.(2) In the United States, the number of
prevalent end-stage renal disease cases continues to increase in patients older
than age 65. In light of the demographic characteristics of patients with CKD and
ESRD, there has been considerable focus on associations between CKD and
cardiovascular outcomes.(3) Until recently, less attention had been paid to other
consequences of CKD in general and among older individuals with CKD in
particular, but there is now solid evidence linking CKD with impairments of
physical function, cognitive function, and emotional function and quality of
life. This review summarizes available literature on these topics, focusing
specifically on physical functioning and frailty, cognitive function, emotional
health, including depression and anxiety, and health-related quality of life.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem that is associated
with excess morbidity, mortality, and health resource utilization. The
progression of CKD is defined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and
leads to a variety of metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypertension,
anemia, and mineral bone disorder. Lower glomerular filtration rate also bears a 
strong relationship with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, end-stage
renal disease, and death. Patterns of CKD progression include linear and
nonlinear trajectories, but kidney function can remain stable for years in some
individuals. Addressing modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD is
needed to attenuate its associated morbidity and mortality. Developing effective 
risk prediction models for CKD progression is critical to identify patients who
are more likely to benefit from interventions and more intensive monitoring.
Accurate risk-prediction algorithms permit systems to best align health care
resources with risk to maximize their effects and efficiency while guiding
overall decision making.

Disturbances of water and electrolyte balance are commonly encountered in older
patients due to a multitude of physiological changes and preexisting morbidities 
with hyponatremia being the most common disorder. Even mild chronic hyponatremia 
can lead to cognitive deficits and gait instability and is associated with an
increased rate of falls and fractures. Additionally, experimental and
epidemiological data suggest that hyponatremia promotes bone resorption and
therefore increases the risk of osteoporosis. Furthermore, osteoporosis and
sarcopenia can be stimulated by hypomagnesemia. Hypernatremia often only results 
in unspecific symptoms but the condition is associated with a clearly increased
mortality. As electrolyte disturbances have a high prevalence in the geriatric
population and can contribute to geriatric syndromes and frailty, relevant
electrolyte alterations should be excluded in all geriatric patients, in
particular after a change in medication schedules.

The incidence and prevalence of chronic renal disease (CKD) in elderly patients
are continuously increasing worldwide. Loss of renal function is not only
considered to be part of the aging process itself but also reflects the
multimorbidity of many geriatric patients. Calculating the glomerular filtration 
rate using specific algorithms validated for the elderly population and measuring
the amount of proteinuria allow an estimation of renal function in elderly
patients with high accuracy. Chronic renal failure has many clinical consequences
and not only results in a delayed excretion of toxins cleared by the kidneys but 
also affects hematogenesis, water and electrolyte balance as well as mineral bone
metabolism. Furthermore, CKD directly leads to and aggravates geriatric syndromes
and in particular the onset of frailty. Therapeutic strategies to halt
progression of CKD not only comprise treatment of the underlying disease but also
efficient blood pressure and diabetic control and the avoidance of nephrotoxic

The recent epidemiologic data pointed out, that the general number of patients on
hemodialysis is steadily increasing, especially in group of elderly patients over
75 years old. The geriatric syndromes are a multietiological disorder related to 
physiological aging and partly associated with comorbid conditions. Frailty,
falls, functional decline and disability, cognitive impairment and depression are
main geriatric syndromes and occurs in patients with impaired renal function more
often than among general population. The causes of higher prevalence of those
syndromes are not well known, but uremic environment and overall renal
replacement therapy may have an important impact on its progress. The patient
with geriatric syndrome require comprehensive treatment as well as physical
rehabilitation, psychiatric cure and support in everyday activities. Herein below
we would like to review recent literature regarding to particular features of
main geriatric syndromes in a group of nephrological patients.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

INTRODUCTION: As the average age of haemodialysis patients rapidly increases
around the world, the number of frail, elderly patients has increased. Frailty is
well known to be an indicator of disability and a poor prognosis for
haemodialysis patients. Exercise interventions have been safely and successfully 
implemented for middle-aged or younger patients undergoing haemodialysis.
However, the benefits of exercise interventions on elderly patients undergoing
haemodialysis remain controversial. The main objective of this study is to
systematically review the effects of exercise training on the physical function, 
exercise capacity and quality of life of elderly patients undergoing
haemodialysis, and to provide an update on the relevant evidence.
METHODS AND ANALYSES: Published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed
the effectiveness of exercise training on haemodialysis patients with respect to 
physical function, exercise tolerance and quality of life will be included.
Bibliographic databases include MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, Web of
Science, PsycINFO and PEDro. The risk of bias of the included RCTs will be
assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and TESTEX. The primary outcome 
will be physical function and exercise tolerance. This review protocol is
reported according to the PRISMA-P 2015 checklist. Statistical analysis will be
performed using review manager software (RevMan V.5.3, Cochrane Collaboration,
Oxford, England).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required because this study
does not include confidential personal data nor does it perform interventions on 
patients. This review is expected to inform readers on the effectiveness of
exercise training in elderly patients undergoing haemodialysis. Findings will be 
presented at conferences and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for
publication.

Mitochondria abnormalities in skeletal muscle may contribute to frailty and
sarcopenia, commonly present in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Dysfunctional mitochondria are also a major source of oxidative stress and may
contribute to cardiovascular disease in CKD We tested the hypothesis that
mitochondrial structure and function worsens with the severity of CKD
Mitochondrial volume density, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, BNIP3, and
PGC1α protein expression were evaluated in skeletal muscle biopsies obtained from
27 subjects (17 controls and 10 with CKD stage 5 on hemodialysis). We also
measured mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma 
isofurans, and plasma F2-isoprostanes in 208 subjects divided into three groups: 
non-CKD (eGFR>60 mL/min), CKD stage 3-4 (eGFR 60-15 mL/min), and CKD stage 5 (on 
hemodialysis). Muscle biopsies from patients with CKD stage 5 revealed lower
mitochondrial volume density, lower mtDNA copy number, and higher BNIP3 content
than controls. mtDNA copy number in PBMCs was decreased with increasing severity 
of CKD: non-CKD (6.48, 95% CI 4.49-8.46), CKD stage 3-4 (3.30, 95% CI 0.85-5.75, 
P = 0.048 vs. non-CKD), and CKD stage 5 (1.93, 95% CI 0.27-3.59, P = 0.001 vs.
non-CKD). Isofurans were higher in patients with CKD stage 5 (median 59.21 pg/mL,
IQR 41.76-95.36) compared to patients with non-CKD (median 49.95 pg/mL, IQR
27.88-83.46, P = 0.001), whereas F2-isoprostanes did not differ among groups.
Severity of CKD is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and markers of
oxidative stress. Mitochondrial abnormalities, which are common in skeletal
muscle from patients with CKD stage 5, may explain the muscle dysfunction
associated with frailty and sarcopenia in CKD Further studies are required to
evaluate mitochondrial function in vivo in patients with different CKD stages.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is widely prevalent worldwide, with a special impact
on elderly population. Around half of people aged over 75 meet diagnostic
criteria for CKD according to the recent 'Kidney disease improving global
outcomes' (KDIGO) 2012 clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and
management of CKD. However, geriatric patients have characteristics that may not 
be addressed by general guidelines. Therefore, it is important to know the
natural history of the disease, symptoms, and 'red-flags' that could help in the 
management of these patients. In this review, a complete approach is presented on
the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of CKD in the geriatric population.

Skeletal muscle mass and muscle function are negatively affected by a variety of 
conditions inherent to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to dialysis treatment.
Skeletal muscle mass and function serve as indicators of the nutritional and
clinical state of CKD patients, and low values or derangements over time are
strong predictors of poor patient outcomes. However, muscle size and function can
be affected by different factors, may decline at different rates, and may have
different patient implications. Therefore, operational definitions of frailty and
sarcopenia have emerged to encompass these 2 dimensions of muscle health, i.e.,
size and functionality. The aim of this review is to appraise available methods
for assessment of muscle mass and functionality, with an emphasis on their
accuracy in the setting of CKD patients. We then discuss the selection of
reference cutoffs for defining conditions of muscle wasting and dysfunction.
Finally, we review definitions applied in studies addressing sarcopenia and
frailty in CKD patients and discuss their applicability for diagnosis and
monitoring.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

BACKGROUND: Geriatric conditions may influence outcomes among patients receiving 
implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). We sought to determine the
prevalence of frailty and dementia among older adults receiving primary
prevention ICDs and to determine the impact of multimorbidity on mortality within
1 year of ICD implantation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The cohort included 83 792 Medicare patients from the
National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry who underwent first primary
prevention ICD implantation between 2006 and 2009. These data were merged with
Medicare analytic files to determine the prevalence of frailty, dementia, and
other conditions before ICD implantation, as well as 1-year mortality. A
validated claim-based algorithm was used to identify frail patients. Mutually
exclusive patterns of chronic conditions were examined. The association of each
pattern with 1-year mortality was assessed using logistic regression models
adjusted for selected patient characteristics. Approximately 1 in 10 Medicare
patients with heart failure receiving a primary prevention ICD had frailty (10%) 
or dementia (1%). One-year mortality was 22% for patients with frailty, 27% for
patients with dementia, and 12% in the overall cohort. Several multimorbidity
patterns were associated with high 1-year mortality rates: dementia with frailty 
(29%), frailty with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25%), and frailty with
diabetes mellitus (23%). These patterns were present in 8% of the cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: More than 10% of Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure receiving
primary prevention ICDs have frailty or dementia. These patients had
significantly higher 1-year mortality than those with other common chronic
conditions. Frailty and dementia should be considered in clinical decision-making
and guideline development.

Consequences of aging are gaining clinical relevance. In transplantation, aging
and immunosenescence impact treatment and outcomes. The impact of aging, however,
will critically depend on distinguishing healthy, chronological aging from
biological aging that may result into frailty. Approximately 15% of individuals
older than 65 years are frail, and it is expected that this condition will gain
more clinical relevance with an expected increase to greater than 20% over the
next 5 years. Clearly, frailty impacts various general aspects of health care and
organ transplantation in particular including patient selection, waitlist
management and treatment after transplantation. In general, frailty has been
characterized by a compromised physiological reserve and an augmented
vulnerability. In comparison to healthy aging, inflammatory markers and cytokines
are increased in frail older adults. Thus, modifications of the immune response, 
in addition to physical limitations and changes of metabolism, are likely to
impact outcomes after transplantation. Here, we provide a risk assessment of
frailty at the time of transplant evaluation and review effects on outcomes and
recovery after transplantation. Moreover, we summarize our current understanding 
of the pathophysiology of frailty and consequences on immune responses and
metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Use of serum creatinine to estimate GFR may lead to underestimation
of the association between self-reported frailty and kidney function. Our
objectives were to evaluate the association of measured GFR (mGFR) with
self-reported frailty among patients with CKD and to determine whether
self-reported frailty was associated with death after adjusting for mGFR.
METHODS: Participants in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study
(1989-1993) had GFR measured using iothalamate clearance (mGFR), and GFR was
estimated based on the CKD-EPI creatinine (eGFRcr) and cystatin C (eGFRcys)
equations. We defined self-reported frailty as three or more of: exhaustion, poor
physical function, low physical activity, and low body weight. Death was
ascertained through 2007 using the National Death Index and the United States
Renal Data System.
RESULTS: Eight hundred twelve MDRD participants (97 %) had complete data on
self-reported frailty (16 % prevalence, N = 130) and mGFR (mean (SD) 33.1 ± 11.7 
ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Higher GFR was associated with lower odds of self-reported
frailty based on mGFR, (OR 0.71, 95 % CI 0.60-0.86 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)),
eGFRcr (OR 0.80, 95 % CI 0.67-0.94 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), and eGFRcys (OR
0.75, 95 % CI 0.62-0.90 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Median follow-up was 17 (IQR
11-18) years, with 371 deaths. Self-reported frailty was associated with a higher
risk of death (HR 1.71, 95 % CI 1.26-2.30), which was attenuated to a similar
degree when mGFR (HR 1.48, 95 % CI 1.08-2.00), eGFRcr (HR 1.57, 95 % CI
1.15-2.10), or eGFRcys (HR 1.51, 95 % CI 1.10-2.10) was included as an indicator 
of kidney function.
CONCLUSIONS: We found an inverse association between kidney function and
self-reported frailty that was similar for mGFR, eGFR and eGFRcys. In this
relatively healthy cohort of clinical trial participants with CKD, using serum
creatinine to estimate GFR did not substantially alter the association of GFR
with self-reported frailty or of self-reported frailty with death.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) in the elderly is a complex condition. It
has a direct impact on the underuse of antithrombotic therapy reported in this
population.
DISCUSSION: All patients aged ≥75 years with AF have an individual yearly risk of
stroke >4 %. However, the risk of hemorrhage is also increased. Moreover, in this
population it is common the presence of other comorbidities, cognitive disorders,
risk of falls and polymedication. This may lead to an underuse of anticoagulant
therapy. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are at least as effective as
conventional therapy, but with lesser risk of intracranial hemorrhage. The
simplification of treatment with these drugs may be an advantage in patients with
cognitive impairment. The great majority of elderly patients with AF should
receive anticoagulant therapy, unless an unequivocal contraindication. DOACs may 
be the drugs of choice in many elderly patients with AF. In this manuscript, the 
available evidence about the management of anticoagulation in elderly patients
with AF is reviewed. In addition, specific practical recommendations about
different controversial issues (i.e. patients with anemia, thrombocytopenia, risk
of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal dysfunction, cognitive impairment, risk of
falls, polymedication, frailty, etc.) are provided.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a
predictor of adverse outcomes. The current article reviews the most common
frailty measures available, gives an overview of their use in the chronic kidney 
disease population, and summarizes their strengths and limitations.
RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty is increasingly recognized as a potent predictor of
adverse outcomes in all stages of chronic kidney disease. Recent investigations
have demonstrated that the clinical perception of frailty by healthcare personnel
or patients themselves is an inaccurate measure of frailty. The clinical frailty 
scale, a simple point-of-care tool for the assessment of frailty, has been shown 
to be a predictor of mortality in individuals on dialysis.
SUMMARY: The Fried criteria have been most extensively used in chronic kidney
disease. However, other criteria using self-reported outcomes, clinical and
cognitive criteria have also been shown to predict adverse outcomes and may be
more applicable in clinical settings. Many of these still require further
validation in the chronic kidney disease population.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the
elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in
comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly
individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength,
body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and
endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined
outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were
assessed.
METHODS: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient
drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12
months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc
Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail
and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition
(DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years 
old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After 
some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30
to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; 
IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 
14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 
2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the 
casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that
frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney
disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either
worse endothelial function or mortality.

AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to 
complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and
functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total
number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and
assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD
0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified
Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P =
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good
construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the
potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for
patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

BACKGROUND: The number of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease opting
for conservative management rather than dialysis is unknown but likely to be
growing as increasingly frail patients with advanced renal disease present to
renal services. Conservative kidney management includes ongoing medical input and
support from a multidisciplinary team. There is limited evidence concerning
patient and carer experience of this choice. This study will explore quality of
life, symptoms, cognition, frailty, performance decision making, costs and impact
on carers in people with advanced chronic kidney disease managed without dialysis
and is funded by the National Institute of Health Research in the UK.
METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, longitudinal study, patients will be
recruited in the UK, by renal research nurses, once they have made the decision
not to embark on dialysis. Carers will be asked to 'opt-in' with consent from
patients. The approach includes longitudinal quantitative surveys of quality of
life, symptoms, decision making and costs for patients and quality of life and
costs for carers, with questionnaires administered quarterly over 12 months.
Additionally, the decision making process will be explored via qualitative
interviews with renal physicians/clinical nurse specialists.
DISCUSSION: The study is designed to capture patient and carer profiles when
conservative kidney management is implemented, and understand trajectories of
care-receiving and care-giving with the aim of optimising palliative care for
this population. It will explore the interactions that lead to clinical care
decisions and the impact of these decisions on informal carers with the intention
of improving clinical outcomes for patients and the experiences of care givers.

It is known that the common physiological denominator of the ageing process is an
attenuation of functional performance with respect to the situation of young
people and adults. However, since the first cohort-based longitudinal studies, it
has not been possible to establish a "linear" relationship between age and
glomerular filtration in all cases. This does not mean that there is no
physiological ageing process at all; in addition to those already elucidated, its
mechanisms include cell senescence, podocyte dysfunction, a vitamin D deficiency,
and homozygotic forms of the MYH9 gene. The aim of the present work was to
analyse the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and, where possible, the
correlation between CKD, defined by an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), plasma
25(OH)D3 levels and the MYH9 gene in a population of elderly and very elderly
persons. These parameters have not been evaluated previously in populations of
elderly and very elderly patients. It is concluded that a moderate decrease in
the eGFR occurs with age. This does not imply the presence of CKD in elderly
people, since in most individuals the reduced eGFR is not accompanied by anaemia,
and no individuals show hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia or a high Alb/Cr ratio.
Here we observed a lower Hb level and an elevated Alb/Cr ratio in subjects
heterozygotic for the MYH9 gene. This could be interpreted in the sense that the 
gene could exert some protective effect on renal function, whereas the
heterozygotic form (allele A) of the MYH9 gene could be considered a very early
marker, a new risk factor for the appearance of CKD, or a sign of renal frailty
in elderly people.

OBJECTIVES: In elderly hemodialysis patients, protein-energy wasting is
associated with poor outcome; however, the association between body mass index
(BMI) changes over time, and survival has been seldom studied in this
particularly frail population.
DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study recruited 502 hemodialysis patients
aged ≥75 years from the French cohort ARNOS and followed them from 2005 to 2009. 
BMI changes over time were modeled by individual linear regression models.
Survival analyses used frailty Cox models.
RESULTS: The population average age was 80.9 years. Forty-one percent of the
patients died during follow-up. A 1 kg/m(2) lower baseline BMI was associated
with a 4% increase in the risk of death over the study period (hazard ratio [HR] 
1.04, 95% confidence interval [1.01-1.08], P = .02). A 5% BMI loss per year was
associated with a 52% increase in the risk of death (HR 1.52, 95% confidence
interval [1.32-1.75], P < .001). In patients who lost weight (>5% BMI loss per
year), the lower was the baseline BMI, the higher was the HR for death. There was
a similar trend in the patients with stable weight (5% BMI loss-5% BMI gain per
year). In patients who gained weight, the HR was unexpectedly higher than in
those with stable weight.
CONCLUSIONS: In elderly hemodialysis patients, the impact of the BMI percent
change on survival was stronger than that of the baseline BMI. Patients with
stable weight had longer survivals than patients who lost or gained weight. Thus,
in this population, BMI changes should be regularly assessed. Further studies
should assess the safety of weight gain strategies.

BACKGROUND: Time in therapeutic range (TTR) of international normalized ratio
(INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 is important for the safety and effectiveness of warfarin
anticoagulation. There are few data on TTR among patients with atrial
fibrillation (AF) in community-based clinical practice.
METHODS: Using the US Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial
Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF), we examined TTR (using a modified Rosendaal method)
among 5,210 patients with AF on warfarin and treated at 155 sites. Patients were 
grouped into quartiles based on TTR data. Multivariable logistic regression
modeling with generalized estimating equations was used to determine patient and 
provider factors associated with the lowest (worst) TTR.
RESULTS: Overall, 59% of the measured INR values were between 2.0 and 3.0, with
an overall mean and median TTR of 65% ± 20% and 68% (interquartile range [IQR]
53%-79%). The median times below and above the therapeutic range were 17% (IQR
8%-29%) and 10% (IQR 3%-19%), respectively. Patients with renal dysfunction,
advanced heart failure, frailty, prior valve surgery, and higher risk for
bleeding (ATRIA score) or stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score) had significantly lower TTR
(P < .0001 for all). Patients treated at anticoagulation clinics had only
slightly higher median TTR (69%) than those not (66%) (P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AF in US clinical practices, TTR on warfarin is 
suboptimal, and those at highest predicted risks for stroke and bleeding were
least likely to be in therapeutic range.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older people, but it is
unclear if it affects survival and rehabilitation outcomes independent of
comorbid conditions and physical function in this population.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort analysis of prospective, routinely collected, linked
clinical data sets.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients discharged from a single inpatient geriatric
rehabilitation center over a 12-year period.
PREDICTORS: Admission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) category as a
predictor of improvement in the 20-point Barthel score (activities of daily
living measure) during rehabilitation; discharge eGFR category and Barthel score 
as predictors of survival postdischarge.
OUTCOMES: Survival postdischarge was modeled using Cox regression analyses,
unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, morbidities (ischemic heart disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, diabetes, and heart failure),
Barthel score and eGFR category on discharge, and serum calcium, hemoglobin, and 
albumin levels. The effect of admission eGFR category on change in Barthel score 
during admission was modeled using analysis of covariance, adjusted for
admission, Barthel score, and comorbid conditions.
RESULTS: 3,012 patients were included; mean age, 84 years. 2,394 patients died
during a mean follow-up of 8.3 years. Compared with patients with eGFR of 60 to
89mL/min/1.73m(2), adjusted HRs for death were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.13-1.40), 1.45
(95% CI, 1.29-1.63), and 1.68 (95% CI, 1.42-1.99) for eGFR categories of 45 to
59, 30 to 44, and <30mL/min/1.73m(2), respectively. The relationship between
discharge Barthel score and survival was similar within each discharge eGFR
category (HRs of 0.95, 0.93, 0.92, 0.95, and 0.90 per Barthel score point within 
eGFR categories of ≥90, 60-89, 45-59, 30-44, and <30mL/min/1.73m(2); P for
interaction = 0.2). Similar improvements in Barthel score between admission and
discharge were seen for each admission eGFR category.
LIMITATIONS: Single-center study using routinely collected clinical data.
CONCLUSIONS: eGFR category and Barthel score are independent risk markers for
survival in older rehabilitation patients, but advanced CKD does not preclude
successful rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition 
with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more
frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other
chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in
pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an
outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was
modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was
used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed 
using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.
RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were
significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those 
who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of
frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was
significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower
physical and mental quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in
pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential
role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of
life.

Are currently GFR estimating equations and standard Kt/V value adequate for
advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) frail elderly patients?

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) elderly patients have a reduced glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) due to the combination of ageing and chronic nephropathy
damage. This situation is very important to be taken into account in order to
prescribe an adequate medication and dialysis dose in this aged group. Besides,
cognitive and urinary incontinence problems make difficult to obtain an adequate 
24-h urine collection in order to evaluate creatinine clearance in this group.
Thus, a reliable GFR estimating equation would be very useful for assisting
elderly CKD patients. Additionally, Kt/V is the main parameter currently used for
dosing dialysis in stage V CKD young and elderly patients. However, frailty and
sarcopenia are prevalent disorders usually suffered by old people, who also
present many physiological changes that could make GFR estimating equations and
standard Kt/V value to become unreliable in this particular group. In conclusion,
based on all these facts, it seems crucial for clinical geriatric nephrology to
carefully evaluate how reliable current GFR estimating equations are, as well as 
which would be an adequate Kt/V value in CKD frail elderly patients.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and
nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney
disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia
are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here.
RECENT FINDINGS: The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among
the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The
association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD 
stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely
associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger
associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy
supplementation combined with low-protein diet for the management of CKD may
prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but
dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis 
therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum
bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23 mEq/l for
nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A
benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven.
SUMMARY: Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and
integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing
comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: The levels of many laboratory parameters are associated with the
outcomes of dialysis patients, but the significance of their variability has not 
been well studied.
METHODS: A total of 384 patients receiving stable hemodialysis treatment during
2002 were followed up for mortality until the end of 2013. The within-patient
coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for 13 laboratory parameters from 
1 year of data. We defined variability as CV and analyzed the survival of the
patients according to the baseline CV values of each parameter by proportional
hazard modeling.
RESULTS: During the 11-year observation period, 125 patients died. Higher CV
levels for eight parameters, namely, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium,
hemoglobin, creatinine, total protein, albumin, potassium and phosphate, were
significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The adjusted hazard ratios for
a high BUN-CV (>15 %) and a high Na-CV (>1.3 %) against a lower CV were 1.92 (95 
% CI 1.31-2.81) and 1.95 (1.36-2.80), respectively. The increased mortality risk 
associated with each variability was attributed to excess non-cardiac deaths. The
CV values of most parameters were correlated with each other and often exhibited 
negative associations with age, diabetes, and mobility as well as the levels of
hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, Na, the protein catabolic rate, and the
creatinine generation rate. Therefore, a high variability was generally
associated with frailty-related adverse prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The variability of several blood parameters had a significant impact
on all-cause and non-cardiac mortality. The levels of the variabilities were most
likely related to poor physical conditions of the patients.

The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising, particularly
among the elderly population. Defining aging as successful or unsuccessful has
become clinically relevant in the last 15 years, with an increased recognition of
the frail phenotype. Frailty has been shown to be associated with CKD and poorer 
outcomes, such as death or dialysis. It is likely that the mechanisms of disease 
in CKD such as altered protein metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and
anemia accelerate normal aging and lead to worsening frailty in elderly patients 
with CKD.

In patients older than 75 years with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the
decision between treatment with dialysis [intention to treat with dialysis (ITD)]
or conservative care (CC) is a challenge. Geriatric assessment can be helpful.
The aim was to identify which factors had had an influence on
decision-making.METHODS: We recruited 56 patients. At baseline we analyzed age,
frailty (defined following the criteria of Fried et al. [J Gerontol A Biol Sci
Med Sci 2001;56:146-156]), dependence for activities of daily living (ADL),
cognitive impairment, depression, comorbidity, cardiovascular disease, and
diabetes. After full information about prognosis and treatment options, the
preferences of the patients and families were taken into consideration as
determinants in the decision-making process. During the follow-up, we evaluated
clinical and laboratory parameters, hospitalization, mortality and reevaluated
frailty.
RESULTS: Twenty patients opted for CC, and 36 patients opted for ITD. On
univariate analysis, the predictive factors of the election of CC were age,
prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and dependence for ADL. In the multivariate
analysis, age and prefrailty remained as predictors for the choice of CC.
Hospitalizations were more frequent in CC. Survival was similar in both groups (p
= 0.098).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessment could be useful for decision-making about the
treatment in elderly patients with CKD. CC may be a good treatment option.

Renal functional reserve and renal recovery after acute kidney injury.

Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.

Renal functional reserve (RFR) represents the capacity of the kidney to increase 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to certain physiological or
pathological stimuli or conditions. Once baseline GFR is determined, RFR can be
assessed clinically after an oral protein load or intravenous amino acid
infusion. In clinical practice, baseline GFR displays variable levels due to diet
or other factors. RFR is the difference between peak 'stress' GFR induced by the 
test (p.o. or i.v.) and the baseline GFR. In clinical scenarios where
hyperfiltration is present (high baseline GFR due to pregnancy, hypertension or
diabetic nephropathy, in solitary kidney or kidney donors), RFR may be fully or
partially used to achieve normal or supranormal renal function. Since commonly
used renal function markers, such as GFR, may remain within normal ranges until
50% of nephrons are lost or in patients with a single remnant kidney, the RFR
test may represent a sensitive and early way to assess the functional decline in 
the kidney. RFR assessment may become an important tool to evaluate the ability
of the kidney to recover completely or partially after a kidney attack. In case
of healing with a defect and progressive fibrosis, recovery may appear complete
clinically, but a reduced RFR may be a sign of a maladaptive repair or
subclinical loss of renal mass. Thus, a reduction in RFR may represent the
equivalent of renal frailty or susceptibility to insults. The main aim of this
article is to review the concept of RFR, its utility in different clinical
scenarios, and future perspective for its use.

The prevalence of aortic valve stenosis (AS) is growing in developed countries
because its prevalence increases with age. A growing number of elderly patients
are currently referred to specialized centres to be evaluated for potential
therapeutic strategies. Indeed, two techniques are nowadays able to treat
high-risk AS patients: TAVI and surgical replacement (AVR). It is the purpose of 
the present review to summarize current knowledge on safety and efficacy of AVR
and TAVI in high-risk patients; to focus on some aspects of recently published
guidelines; to emphasize the growing importance of pre-operative individual risk 
assessment, which is considered the real crucial point for patient selection and 
trial's comparisons. Indeed, it is worth of noting that currently adopted
risk-scores do not show satisfactory performances. Accordingly, it becomes of
utmost importance to investigate several baseline but still neglected patients'
characteristics (e.g. frailty, functional status, co-morbid conditions, etc.), as
well as their pathogenetic relationships with interventional results and
follow-up prognosis. All these items are emphasized in the present review.
Finally, we have tried to anticipate future scenarios in terms of both ongoing
clinical trials and improvements of risk-scores.

Frailty in the elderly is a state of vulnerability to poor resolution of
homoeostasis after a stressor event and is a consequence of cumulative decline in
many physiological systems during a lifetime. This cumulative decline depletes
homoeostatic reserves until minor stressor events trigger disproportionate
changes in health status. It is usually associated to adverse health outcomes and
to one-year mortality risk. Physical exercise has found to be effective in
preventing frailty and disability in this population. Chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is also a clinical condition where protein energy-wasting, sarcopenia and
dynapenia ,very common symptoms in the frail elderly, may occur. Moreover elderly
and CKD patients are both affected by an impaired physical performance that may
be reversed by physical exercise with an improvement of the survival rate. These 
similarities suggest that frailty may be a common pathway of aging and CKD that
may induce disability and that can be prevented by a multidimensional approach in
which physical exercise plays an important role.

[How to manage chronic kidney disease in the elderly?].

[Article in French]

Krzesinski JM, Delanaye P.

From age 30 onwards, kidney function physiologically decreases although this
deterioration cannot yet be called chronic kidney disease. The latter appears in 
those exposed to cardiovascular risk factors associated with inflammation and
oxidative stress. A diffuse atherosclerosis then develops Patients with a
decreased glomerular filtration rate, especially below the threshold of 45
ml/min, are characterised by a poor physical heath and by cognitive disorders,
leading to frailty. In these conditions, a management strategy to reduce the
increased risk of acute kidney injury should be outlined and the need for renal
replacement therapy be considered. One must try to maintain the best possible
quality of life, promoting in some situations a conservative approach.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in 
individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on 
their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of
cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that
highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid
conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating
cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including
microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally,
studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected
in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with
worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk
of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible
short-term effects on markers of physical performance.
SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to 
better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

Frailty and quality of life: a cross-sectional study of Brazilian patients with
pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease.

Mansur HN, Colugnati FA, Grincenkov FR, Bastos MG.

PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces frailty and worsens quality of life
(QOL), even in the early stages of the disease and in young patients. However,
there is a lack of knowledge about the relationship between frailty and QOL in
CKD patients. Thus, we investigated this relationship in a sample of CKD
patients.
METHODS: A cross-observational study was conducted, in which 61 CKD patients
receiving pre-dialysis treatment were assessed. All participants completed the
Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used valid and reliable methods to
classify subjects as frail or non-frail according to Johansen's et al. (2007)
criteria. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used
to compare the groups. In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted
to measure associations between identified variables and frailty. We also
performed simple linear regression using the SF-36 physical and mental composite 
scores.
RESULTS: Almost half of the sample (42.6%) exhibited evidence of frailty. The
groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, and all SF-36 domains,
excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Frailty was significantly
associated with all SF-36 domains, again excluding Social Functioning and Role
Emotional. Regression analysis revealed no significant between-group differences 
in composite physical and mental health scores generated by the SF-36 (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Frail and non-frail CKD patients differed significantly in seven of
the eight SF-36 domains. The frail group displayed diminished physical and mental
functioning when their SF-36 scores were divided by their physical and mental
composite scores. Frailty was correlated with QOL domains, with the exception of 
the social domain. There is a need for interventions targeting the
characteristics of frailty, to provide better treatment and optimize overall QOL.

The objective of this article is to review the current and emerging treatments of
CKD prior to dialysis in the elderly. Worldwide, there are increasing numbers of 
people who are aged over 65 years. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of
elderly patients presenting with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in
the more advanced stages. The elderly have quite different health care needs
related to their associated comorbidity, frailty, social isolation, poor
functional status, and cognitive decline. Clinical trials assessing treatments
for CKD have usually excluded patients older than 70-75 years; therefore, it is
difficult to translate current therapies recommended for younger patients with
CKD across to the elderly. Many elderly people with CKD progress to end-stage
kidney disease and face the dilemma of whether to undertake dialysis or accept a 
conservative approach supported by palliative care. This places pressure on the
patient, their family, and on health care resources. The clinical trajectory of
elderly CKD patients has in the past been unclear, but recent evidence suggests
that many patients over 75 years of age with multiple comorbidities have greatly 
reduced life expectancies and quality of life, even if they choose dialysis
treatment. Offering a conservative pathway supported by palliative care is a
reasonable option for some patients under these circumstances. The elderly person
who chooses to have dialysis will frequently have different requirements than
younger patients. Kidney transplantation can still result in improved life
expectancy and quality of life in the elderly, in carefully selected people.
There is a genuine need for the inclusion of the elderly in CKD clinical trials
in the future so we can produce evidence-based therapies for this group. In
addition, new therapies to treat and slow CKD progression are needed for all age 
groups.

BACKGROUND: Although dialysis prolongs life for patients with end-stage kidney
disease, 20% of deaths in this population are preceded by dialysis therapy
withdrawal. Recently, there has been more focus on conservative (nondialytic)
care as a legitimate option, particularly for elderly patients. This study aims
to describe patients' and caregivers' perspectives on conservative treatment and 
end-of-life care in chronic kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.
SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with CKD and caregivers.
SEARCH STRATEGY & SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and reference lists
were searched to May 2013.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the findings.
RESULTS: 26 studies involving more than 711 patients (non-dialysis dependent
[n=41], hemodialysis [n=544], peritoneal dialysis [n=9]; unspecified dialysis
modality [n=31], conservative management [n=86]) and 178 caregivers were
included. We identified 5 themes: invasive suffering (bodily deterioration, loss 
of freedom and independence, unyielding fatigue and pain, resignation, treatment 
burden and harm, financial strain), personal vulnerability (imminence of death,
misunderstanding and judgment, autonomy and dignity, medical abandonment, trust
and safety), relational responsibility (being a burden, demonstrating loyalty,
protecting others from grief), negotiating existential tensions (accepting
natural course of life, disrupted aging, worthlessness, living on borrowed time, 
respecting sanctity of life, life satisfaction, preserving self-identity), and
preparedness (decisional clarity, informational power, spirituality and hope).
LIMITATIONS: Non-English articles were excluded; therefore, the transferability
of findings to other populations is unclear.
CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with CKD experience physical and psychosocial frailty 
and feel ambivalent about prolonging life. Some caregivers believe in providing
relief from suffering, but are uncertain about making decisions regarding
dialysis therapy initiation and discontinuation. We suggest that CKD management
should encompass palliative care strategies that promote emotional resilience,
sense of well-being, and self-value. Also, respectful and attentive communication
may empower patients to convey their values and preferences about their own care.

Thoughtful decision-making in a patient with cancer and kidney disease requires a
comprehensive discussion of prognosis and therapy options for both conditions
framed by the individual's preferences and goals of care. An estimate of overall 
prognosis is generated that includes the patient's clinical presentation and
parameters associated with adverse outcomes, such as age, performance status,
frailty, malnutrition, and comorbidities. Empathic communication of this
information using a shared decision-making approach can lead to an informed
decision that respects patient autonomy and is consistent with the patient's
"big-picture" goals and personal values.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical
function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness
and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a
heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of
this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general
population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science,
CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD
and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text
review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. 
From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in
patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with
increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. 
In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher 
risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished
physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may 
lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to
understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with
clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at high risk of falls, with
subsequent complications including fractures, loss of independence,
hospitalization, and institutionalization. Factors associated with falls are
poorly understood in this population. We hypothesized that insights derived from 
studies of the elderly might apply to adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis;
we focused on frailty, a phenotype of physiological decline strongly associated
with falls in the elderly.
METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal study of 95 patients undergoing
hemodialysis (1/2009-3/2010), the association of frailty with future falls was
explored using adjusted Poisson regression. Frailty was classified using the
criteria established by Fried et al., as a combination of five components:
shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low activity, and slowed walking speed.
RESULTS: Over a median 6.7-month period of longitudinal follow-up, 28.3% of study
participants (25.9% of those under 65, 29.3% of those 65 and older) experienced a
fall. After adjusting for age, sex, race, comorbidity, disability, number of
medications, marital status, and education, frailty independently predicted a
3.09-fold (95% CI: 1.38-6.90, P=0.006) higher number of falls. This relationship 
between frailty and falls did not differ for younger and older adults (P=0.57).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, a validated construct in the elderly, was a strong and
independent predictor of falls in adults undergoing hemodialysis, regardless of
age. Our results may aid in identifying frail hemodialysis patients who could be 
targeted for multidimensional fall prevention strategies.

BACKGROUND: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated
risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly
associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and
frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established.
METHODS: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test
of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of
frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting
for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for
the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty
status.
RESULTS: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49
(36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of
participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for 
eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61
points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all
comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p
= 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated with worse frailty
status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).
CONCLUSIONS: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and
frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD
patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted
interventions.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of
physical functioning and encouragement of physical activity in management of the 
patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), implementation has been undermined by 
a lack of understanding of the evidence for this recommendation. The purpose of
this review is to present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic
cohorts that report associations between low levels of physical functioning
and/or low physical activity and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Low levels of physical activity and poor physical functioning
are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical outcomes in adult
patients with CKD, regardless of treatment modality. Low physical performance and
activity limitations are more prevalent in patients with CKD, regardless of age, 
compared to older community-dwelling adults.
SUMMARY: The strength of the evidence presented should strongly motivate a focus 
of treatment on assessing and improving physical activity and physical function
as part of routine patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical
activity interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of
age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that is
similar to or higher than the general population of elderly adults; physical
activity, physical function, and performance are strongly associated with
all-cause mortality; and exercise training and exercise counseling have been
shown to improve measures of physical functioning.

Evidence has recently been building that the presence of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is an independent contributor to decline in physical and cognitive
functions in older adults. CKD affects 45% of persons older than 70 years of age 
and can double the risk for physical impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and
frailty. To increase awareness of this relatively new concept of CKD as a risk
factor for accelerated aging, we review studies on the association of CKD with
physical function, frailty, and cognitive function. We also present a summary of 
the proposed mechanisms for these associations.

BACKGROUND: Changes in anemia management over the past decade have produced
downward shifts in hemoglobin concentrations. We aimed to examine the effect on
use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We identified point prevalent Medicare hemodialysis
patients as of January 1 of each year (1999-2010) and categorized them based on
3-month (April to June) mean hemoglobin levels (<10 or ≥10 g/dL) in each year.
PREDICTORS: Hemoglobin patterns over time and clinical profiles based on achieved
hemoglobin concentrations.
OUTCOMES: RBC transfusion use.
MEASUREMENTS: We used negative binomial modeling to examine the effect of
hemoglobin level <10 g/dL on transfusion use, adjusting for case-mix differences.
RESULTS: Proportions of patients with mean hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL decreased
from 10% (1999) to ~4% (2005), but began increasing after 2006 and reached 6% by 
2010. Accounting for case-mix differences, transfusion rates remained relatively 
constant at approximately 7.9 per 100 person-months for patients with hemoglobin 
levels <10 g/dL and 2 per 100 person-months for patients with hemoglobin levels
≥10 g/dL. Patients with average hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL were more likely to
receive transfusions (risk ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 2.1-2.2) even after adjustment;
the risk ratio doubled if hemoglobin levels remained <10 g/dL for 6 months (4.4; 
95% CI, 3.7-5.2).
LIMITATIONS: Limited in generalizability to patients with Medicare as primary
payer; residual confounding from factors such as frailty and chronic inflammation
cannot be excluded; categorizing patients based on an average of 3 outpatient
hemoglobin measurements may introduce some misclassification.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk of transfusion increases substantially with hemoglobin
concentrations <10 g/dL; risk appears to be independent of other clinical
factors. If anemia management patterns shift toward lower hemoglobin
concentrations, RBC transfusion use likely will increase in dialysis patients.

Bone fracture risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher
than that in healthy subjects. Frailty caused by neuromuscular impairment as well
as bone fragility due to bone loss and impaired bone quality is thought to be
involved in the elevated fracture risk in CKD. Altered material and structural
properties might be attributed to the reduced bone strength. The structural
properties in CKD patients are characterized in 1) cortical thinning and cortical
porosity, and 2) irregular thickening and loss of connectivity in trabecular
bone. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that skeletal changes in the
structural properties may be initiated at earlier stage of CKD than we expected.

CKD is associated with impairments in health status, physical function, and
frailty. The aim of the current prospective cohort study was to determine whether
CKD predicted new LTCI need certification among community-dwelling older Japanese
adults. This was a prospective cohort study. We analyzed the cohort data from a
prospective study, The Japan Multicenter Aging Cohort for Care Prevention
(J-MACC). We followed 8063 elderly adults for 2 years, and we analyzed the
relationship between CKD and LTCI need. The outcome studied was new certification
for LTCI service need during a 2-year period. We measured serum creatinine (the
estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR), serum albumin, frailty checklist
scores, and body mass index. During the 2-year follow-up, 536 subjects (6.6%)
were newly certified as needing LTCI services. We stratified the cohort according
to eGFR quartile and performed multivariate analyses using an eGFR value of
71.4-83.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) as a reference. We found that subjects with eGFR
values <60.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) had a significantly elevated risk of LTCI service
need (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.44 [95% CI 1.12-1.86]). Our results indicate that 
CKD is independently associated with new LTCI service need certification and is
an important marker of frailty in older adults.

Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of
Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and
catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate
with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and
provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of
PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology
of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition)
due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent 
factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include
uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent
inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of
hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition,
comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the
dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW.

BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be
associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Given the high
prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD in the general population, in depth analysis
of this association is warranted.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We pooled individual participant data from 5 community-based
cohorts from Europe (second Nord-Trøndelag Health Study [HUNT2], Prevention of
Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease [PREVEND], and the Tromsø study) and the
United States (Atherosclerosis Risks in Communities [ARIC] and Cardiovascular
Health Study [CHS]) to assess the association of estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and CKD with objectively verified VTE. To estimate
adjusted hazard ratios for VTE, categorical and continuous spline models were fit
by using Cox regression with shared-frailty or random-effect meta-analysis. A
total of 1178 VTE events occurred over 599 453 person-years follow-up. Relative
to eGFR 100 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), hazard ratios for VTE were 1.29 (95% confidence
interval, 1.04-1.59) for eGFR 75, 1.31 (1.00-1.71) for eGFR 60, 1.82 (1.27-2.60) 
for eGFR 45, and 1.95 (1.26-3.01) for eGFR 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). In comparison
with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 5.0 mg/g, the hazard ratios for VTE 
were 1.34 (1.04-1.72) for ACR 30 mg/g, 1.60 (1.08-2.36) for ACR 300 mg/g, and
1.92 (1.19-3.09) for ACR 1000 mg/g. There was no interaction between clinical
categories of eGFR and ACR (P=0.20). The adjusted hazard ratio for CKD, defined
as eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or albuminuria ≥30 mg/g, (versus no CKD) was
1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.06). Associations were consistent in
subgroups according to age, sex, and comorbidities, and for unprovoked versus
provoked VTE, as well.
CONCLUSIONS: Both eGFR and ACR are independently associated with increased risk
of VTE in the general population, even across the normal eGFR and ACR ranges.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 
(KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation,
Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of
kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease
to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of
older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress
to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific
cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older
adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have
shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated 
with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis)
and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally
thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes 
include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research
studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD 
and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the
longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the
oldest old with CKD.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a physiological vulnerability status of the patient
which is associated with the increased number of hospitalization and death.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of frailty and its associated factors in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on conservative treatment (CT),
hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).
METHODS: Frailty was assessed in 146 patients (86 CT, 37 HD and 23 PD) and
characterized as muscle weakness and exhaustion--by the physical aspect and
vitality domains, respectively, evaluated in the SF-36 quality of life
instrument; physical inactivity--if he or she answered "never" or "hardly ever"
when asked about physical activity; and as unintentional weight loss (> 4.5 kg
per year). Patients were divided into three groups: non-fragile (NF), pre-fragile
(PF) and fragile (F). The demographic, clinical and laboratory data were
extracted from patient charts.
RESULTS: Frailty was diagnosed in 36% of patients on CT, 37.8% in HD and 47.8% in
PD. It was characterized in 36.8% of patients aged between 20 and 40 years and
40.3% of those between 41 and 60 years. Frailty was significantly associated with
the use of vitamin D (r = 0.16; p = 0.03), hemoglobin (r = -0.14; p = - 0.02) and
intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.16; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is common among patients with CKD on conservative treatment 
and dialysis, even in those who are not elderly. In the patients studied, the
phenotype of frailty was associated with no usage of vitamin D, lower serum
levels of hemoglobin and higher levels of parathyroid hormone.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced
functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing
the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the
CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or
evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based
cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study.
OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association
with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more
of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss,
exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum
cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to
relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was
51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much
older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components
were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes,
eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a
2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of
frailty compared with GFR(cys) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during 
a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was
associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or 
dialysis therapy.
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal
relationships between CKD and frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is
associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.

Increasing numbers of patients are starting dialysis who have limited prognoses
for 6-month survival. The presence of multiple comorbidities, aging, and frailty 
contributes to this phenomenon. The rate of dialysis withdrawal has been
accelerating over the past decade, and this calls into question the condition of 
patients who are initiating dialysis. One option is to consider and discuss the
"no dialysis" option with patients and family. Patients need to be identified who
may benefit from this option, and their medical management needs to be reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney
disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated
criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to 
determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were
associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the
association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly
increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for
the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds 
of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation,
vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and
chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney
disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.
Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection
remain elusive.

BACKGROUND: Frailty has been defined as a tool to define individuals who lack
functional reserve and are at risk for functional decline. We hypothesized that
chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) would be associated with a greater prevalence
of frailty and disability in the elderly.
METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data collected from the
Cardiovascular Health Study, which enrolled 5,888 community-dwelling adults aged 
65 years or older from 4 clinical centers in the United States. Renal
insufficiency is defined as a serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL or greater (>
or =115 micromol/L) in women and 1.5 mg/dL or greater (> or =133 micromol/L) in
men. Frailty is defined by the presence of 3 of the following abnormalities:
unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, measured weakness, slow
walking speed, and low physical activity. Disability is defined as any
self-reported difficulty with activities of daily living.
RESULTS: Among 5,808 participants with creatinine levels measured at entry, 15.9%
of men (n = 394) and 7.6% of women (n = 254) had CRI. Prevalences of frailty (15%
versus 6%; P < 0.001) and disability (12% versus 7%; P = 0.001) were greater in
participants with CRI compared with those with normal renal function. After
multivariate adjustment for comorbidity, CRI remained significantly associated
with frailty (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.41), but not
disability (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.69).
CONCLUSION: Elderly persons with CRI have a high prevalence of frailty, which may
signal their risk for progression to adverse health outcomes. If confirmed in
other studies, identification of frailty in patients with CRI may warrant special
interventions to preserve their independence, quality of life, and survival.
