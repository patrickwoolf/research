BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frail patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an
increased hospitalisation and mortality rate. However, many popular frailty
screening methods have not been validated in patients with CKD. This study
evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of several frailty screening methods in
patients with CKD G4-5 and those established on haemodialysis (G5D).
METHODS: Ninety participants with CKD G4-5D were recruited from Nephrology
Outpatient Clinics and 2 Haemodialysis Units between December 2016 and December
2017. Frailty was diagnosed using the Fried Frailty Phenotype. The following
frailty screening tests were evaluated: Clinical Frailty Scale, PRISMA-7, CKD
Frailty Index, CKD FI-LAB, walking speed, hand grip strength and Short Physical
Performance Battery.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 69 years (SD ±13). One-third of
participants were dialysis-dependent. Nineteen (21%) patients were categorised as
frail, 42 (47%) as pre-frail and 29 (32%) as robust. Overall, walking speed was
the most discriminative measure (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.93-1.00], sensitivity 0.84
[95% CI 0.62-0.94], specificity 0.96 [95% CI 0.88-0.99]). The Clinical Frailty
Scale had the best performance of the non-physical assessment frailty screening
methods (AUC 0.90 [95% CI 0.84-0.97], sensitivity 0.79 [95% CI 0.57-0.91],
specificity 0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.93]).
CONCLUSIONS: Walking speed can be used to accurately screen for frailty in CKD
populations. If it is not practical to perform a physical assessment to screen
for frailty, the Clinical Frailty Scale is a useful alternative.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Decision-making in elderly patients considering dialysis is
highly complex. With the increasing number of elderly with end-stage kidney
disease (ESKD), it may be important to assess geriatric impairments in this
population. The aim of the Geriatric assessment in OLder patients starting
Dialysis (GOLD) study was to assess the prevalence of geriatric impairments and
frailty in the elderly ESKD population by means of a geriatric assessment (GA),
which is a comprehensive tool for overall health assessment.
METHODS: This study included 285 patients ≥65 years: 196 patients at the time of 
dialysis initiation and 89 patients who chose maximal conservative management
(MCM). The GA assessed cognition, mood, nutritional status, (instrumental)
activities of daily living (ADL), mobility, comorbidity burden, quality of life
and overall frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 78 years and 36% were women. Of the
incident dialysis patients, 77% started haemodialysis and 23% started peritoneal 
dialysis. Geriatric impairments were highly prevalent in both dialysis and MCM
patients. Most frequently impaired geriatric domains in the dialysis group were
functional performance (ADL 29%, instrumental ADL (iADL) 79%), cognition (67%)
and comorbidity (41%). According to the GA, 77% in the dialysis group and 88% in 
the MCM group had 2 or more geriatric impairments. In the MCM group, functional
impairment (ADL 45%, iADL 85%) was highly prevalent.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric impairments are highly prevalent in the elderly ESKD
population. Since impairments can be missed when not searched for in regular
(pre)dialysis care, the first step of improving nephrologic care is awareness of 
the extensiveness of geriatric impairment.

The decision about when to start dialysis for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is 
complex and is influenced by many factors. ESKD-related symptoms and signs are
the most common indications for dialysis initiation. Creatinine-based formulae to
estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are inaccurate in patients with ESKD
and, thus, the decision to start dialysis should not be based solely on estimated
GFR (eGFR). Early dialysis initiation (ie, at an eGFR > 10 mL/min/1.73
m<sup>2</sup>) is not associated with a morbidity and mortality benefit, as shown
in the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) study. This observation has
been incorporated into the latest guidelines, which place greater emphasis on the
assessment of patients' symptoms and signs rather than eGFR. It is suggested that
in asymptomatic patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease, dialysis may be
safely delayed until the eGFR is at least as low as 5-7 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>
if there is careful clinical follow-up and adequate patient education. The
decision on when to start dialysis is even more challenging in older patients.
Due to their comorbidities and frailty, dialysis initiation may be associated
with worse outcomes and quality of life. Therefore, the decision to start
dialysis in these patients should be carefully weighed against its risks, and
conservative care should be considered in appropriate cases. To optimise the
decision-making process for dialysis initiation, patients need to be referred to 
a nephrologist in a timely fashion to allow adequate pre-dialysis care and
planning. Dialysis initiation and its timing should be a shared decision between 
physician, patients and family members, and should be tailored to the individual 
patient's needs.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Withdrawal from maintenance hemodialysis before death 
has become more common because of high disease and treatment burden. The study
objective was to identify patient factors and examine the terminal course
associated with hemodialysis withdrawal, and assess patterns of palliative care
involvement before death among patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We designed an observational
cohort study of adult patients on incident hemodialysis in a midwestern United
States tertiary center, from January 2001 to November 2013, with death events
through to November 2015. Logistic regression models evaluated associations
between patient characteristics and withdrawal status and palliative care service
utilization.
RESULTS: Among 1226 patients, 536 died and 262 (49% of 536) withdrew. A random
sample (10%; 52 out of 536) review of Death Notification Forms revealed 73%
sensitivity for withdrawal. Risk factors for withdrawal before death included
older age, white race, palliative care consultation within 6 months,
hospitalization within 30 days, cerebrovascular disease, and no coronary artery
disease. Most withdrawal decisions were made by patients (60%) or a family member
(33%; surrogates). The majority withdrew either because of acute medical
complications (51%) or failure to thrive/frailty (22%). After withdrawal, median 
time to death was 7 days (interquartile range, 4-11). In-hospital deaths were
less common in the withdrawal group (34% versus 46% nonwithdrawal, P=0.003). A
third (34%; 90 out of 262) of those that withdrew received palliative care
services. Palliative care consultation in the withdrawal group was associated
with longer hemodialysis duration (odds ratio, 1.19 per year; 95% confidence
interval, 1.10 to 1.3; P<0.001), hospitalization within 30 days of death (odds
ratio, 5.78; 95% confidence interval, 2.62 to 12.73; P<0.001), and death in
hospital (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 3.27; P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study, the rate of hemodialysis withdrawals
were twice the frequency previously described. Acute medical complications and
frailty appeared to be driving factors. However, palliative care services were
used in only a minority of patients.

BACKGROUND: Survival for patients commencing renal replacement therapy is around 
90% in the first year and 83% at two years after starting dialysis. The factors
that appear to predict mortality are comorbidity and frailty associated with
kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate, age and biochemical factors.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse the condition of patients starting renal replacement
therapy, based on biomarkers commonly used in clinical practice and their
association with mortality, measured 6 and 12 months after initiating replacement
therapy.
METHODS: A one-year prospective follow-up study with 189 patients.
Sociodemographic variables, aetiology of renal disease, comorbidities, prior
nephrology service monitoring, prior renal transplantation and biochemical
parameters at the time of initiating replacement therapy were analysed.
RESULTS: The overall percentage of death during the one-year follow-up was 6.87%,
with 64% of deaths occurring during the first six months. The only variable
independently associated with mortality was low albumin levels.
CONCLUSION: Although most patients in this centre are monitored by a nephrologist
prior to starting replacement therapy, many nevertheless fail to achieve the
biochemical targets recommended. One such parameter is albumin, which proved at
the start of replacement therapy to be an independent predictor of mortality.
Findings of this study show the need to intervene on certain biochemical
parameters during the pre-dialysis stage and at the start of dialysis, in order
to improve survival in this group of patients.

BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the
general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear
whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney failure.
METHODS: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults with
end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South
America designed to examine the association between periodontitis and all-cause
and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis.
Participants were matched 1:1 on their propensity score for moderate to severe
periodontitis assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal 
Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared
frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries.
RESULTS: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe
periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score methods to generate a
matched cohort of participants with periodontitis similar to those with none or
mild periodontal disease, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a 
lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74,
95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 
person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were
not changed substantially when participants were limited to those with 12 or more
natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes of cardiovascular death.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does not appear 
to be associated with an increased risk of early death in adults treated with
hemodialysis.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation offers improved survival and quality of life
to an increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease.
However, elderly kidney transplant recipients may face unique challenges due to a
higher burden of comorbidity, greater cumulative risk of
immunosuppression-related complications and increasing frailty. We aimed to
describe the perspectives of elderly kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to April 2015. Qualitative studies
were eligible if they reported views from elderly kidney transplant recipients
(≥60 years). Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the findings.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving >116 recipients were included. We
identified seven themes. 'Regaining strength and vitality' meant valuing the
physical and psychosocial improvements in daily functioning and life
participation. 'Extending life' was the willingness to accept any organ,
including extended criteria kidneys, to prolong survival. 'Debt of gratitude'
entailed conscious appreciation toward their donor while knowing they were unable
to repay their sacrifice. 'Moral responsibility to maintain health' motivated
adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations out of an ethical duty to
protect their gift for graft survival. 'Unabating and worsening forgetfulness'
hindered self-management. 'Disillusionment with side effects and complications'
reflected disappointment and exasperation with the unintended consequences of
medications. 'Finality of treatment option' was an acute awareness that the
current transplant may be their last.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation was perceived to slow and even reverse the
experience of aging among elderly recipients, especially compared with dialysis. 
However, some were frustrated over persistent limitations after transplant,
struggled with the burden of medication side effects and worried about a possible
return to dialysis if the transplant failed. Clarifying patient expectations of
transplantation, providing support to alleviate the debilitating impacts of
immunosuppression and addressing fears about deteriorating health and graft
failure may improve satisfaction and outcomes in elderly kidney transplant
recipients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement
can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light
chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies
have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We
evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in
France.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered
in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 
with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored
for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as
renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and 
causes of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334
(23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72
years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was
observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation
was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis,
67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were 
malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and
cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty 
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high
BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is
poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of
death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

The number of patients with end-stage kidney disease 65 years and older is
growing, and this growth is expected to continue. The presence of medical
comorbidities, limited life expectancy, frailty, and poor functional status in
these patients poses substantial challenges in clinical decision-making and
provision of optimal care. Frailty is more common in elderly patients with CKD
than without and is associated with poor outcomes. Several prognostic tools were 
developed to estimate the rate of CKD progression among elderly, and risk of
mortality after dialysis initiation. Risk factors for CKD progression among
elderly include low estimated glomerular filtration rate, high baseline
proteinuria, acute kidney injury, low serum albumin, and presence of congestive
heart failure. The decision to initiate dialysis in the elderly should take into 
consideration life expectancy, risks and benefits of each dialysis modality,
quality of life, and patient and caregiver preferences. This article discusses
common issues in the elderly with end-stage kidney disease, with particular
emphasis on the impact of frailty and functional status, choice of dialysis
modality and vascular access, and prognosis after dialysis initiation, to assist 
the nephrologist in making decisions regarding optimal care for this complex
group of patients.

BACKGROUND: Dental disease is more extensive in adults with chronic kidney
disease, but whether dental health and behaviors are associated with survival in 
the setting of hemodialysis is unknown.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multinational cohort.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,205 adults treated with long-term hemodialysis, 2010 to
2012 (Oral Diseases in Hemodialysis [ORAL-D] Study).
PREDICTORS: Dental health as assessed by a standardized dental examination using 
World Health Organization guidelines and personal oral care, including
edentulousness; decayed, missing, and filled teeth index; teeth brushing and
flossing; and dental health consultation.
OUTCOMES: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months after dental
assessment.
MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models
fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within
countries.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 22.1 months, 942 deaths occurred, including
477 cardiovascular deaths. Edentulousness (adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.51) 
and decayed, missing, or filled teeth score ≥ 14 (adjusted HR, 1.70; 95% CI,
1.33-2.17) were associated with early all-cause mortality, while dental flossing,
using mouthwash, brushing teeth daily, spending at least 2 minutes on oral
hygiene daily, changing a toothbrush at least every 3 months, and visiting a
dentist within the past 6 months (adjusted HRs of 0.52 [95% CI, 0.32-0.85], 0.79 
[95% CI, 0.64-0.97], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58-0.99], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-0.99], 0.79
[95% CI, 0.65-0.95], and 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.96], respectively) were associated 
with better survival. Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar.
LIMITATIONS: Convenience sample of clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: In adults treated with hemodialysis, poorer dental health was
associated with early death, whereas preventive dental health practices were
associated with longer survival.

Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults in Primary and Secondary Care.

The Renal National Service Framework (NSF), and the subsequent NICE Clinical
Practice Guideline for early identification and management of adults with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) in primary and secondary care (CG73), served to emphasise
the change in focus in renal medicine from treatment of established kidney
disease to earlier identification and prevention of kidney disease. CKD describes
abnormal kidney function and/or structure. It is common, frequently unrecognised 
and often coexists with other conditions (for example, cardiovascular disease and
diabetes). Moderate to severe CKD also carries an increased risk of other
significant adverse outcomes such acute kidney injury, falls, frailty and
mortality. The risk of developing CKD increases with increasing age, and some
conditions that coexist with CKD become more severe and increasingly prevalent as
kidney dysfunction advances. CKD can progress to end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD)in a small but significant percentage of people. CKD is usually
asymptomatic but it is detectable, and tests for detecting CKD are both simple
and freely available. There is evidence that treatment can prevent or delay the
progression of CKD, reduce or prevent the development of complications and reduce
the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, because of a lack of specific
symptoms, CKD frequently remains undetected and unrecognised. As a consequence
people with CKD are often not diagnosed, or diagnosed late when CKD is at an
advanced stage. Late diagnosis is associated with increased morbidity, mortality 
and healthcare associated costs.

Current and emerging treatment options for the elderly patient with chronic
kidney disease.

The objective of this article is to review the current and emerging treatments of
CKD prior to dialysis in the elderly. Worldwide, there are increasing numbers of 
people who are aged over 65 years. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of
elderly patients presenting with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in
the more advanced stages. The elderly have quite different health care needs
related to their associated comorbidity, frailty, social isolation, poor
functional status, and cognitive decline. Clinical trials assessing treatments
for CKD have usually excluded patients older than 70-75 years; therefore, it is
difficult to translate current therapies recommended for younger patients with
CKD across to the elderly. Many elderly people with CKD progress to end-stage
kidney disease and face the dilemma of whether to undertake dialysis or accept a 
conservative approach supported by palliative care. This places pressure on the
patient, their family, and on health care resources. The clinical trajectory of
elderly CKD patients has in the past been unclear, but recent evidence suggests
that many patients over 75 years of age with multiple comorbidities have greatly 
reduced life expectancies and quality of life, even if they choose dialysis
treatment. Offering a conservative pathway supported by palliative care is a
reasonable option for some patients under these circumstances. The elderly person
who chooses to have dialysis will frequently have different requirements than
younger patients. Kidney transplantation can still result in improved life
expectancy and quality of life in the elderly, in carefully selected people.
There is a genuine need for the inclusion of the elderly in CKD clinical trials
in the future so we can produce evidence-based therapies for this group. In
addition, new therapies to treat and slow CKD progression are needed for all age 
groups.

BACKGROUND: Although dialysis prolongs life for patients with end-stage kidney
disease, 20% of deaths in this population are preceded by dialysis therapy
withdrawal. Recently, there has been more focus on conservative (nondialytic)
care as a legitimate option, particularly for elderly patients. This study aims
to describe patients' and caregivers' perspectives on conservative treatment and 
end-of-life care in chronic kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.
SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with CKD and caregivers.
SEARCH STRATEGY & SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and reference lists
were searched to May 2013.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the findings.
RESULTS: 26 studies involving more than 711 patients (non-dialysis dependent
[n=41], hemodialysis [n=544], peritoneal dialysis [n=9]; unspecified dialysis
modality [n=31], conservative management [n=86]) and 178 caregivers were
included. We identified 5 themes: invasive suffering (bodily deterioration, loss 
of freedom and independence, unyielding fatigue and pain, resignation, treatment 
burden and harm, financial strain), personal vulnerability (imminence of death,
misunderstanding and judgment, autonomy and dignity, medical abandonment, trust
and safety), relational responsibility (being a burden, demonstrating loyalty,
protecting others from grief), negotiating existential tensions (accepting
natural course of life, disrupted aging, worthlessness, living on borrowed time, 
respecting sanctity of life, life satisfaction, preserving self-identity), and
preparedness (decisional clarity, informational power, spirituality and hope).
LIMITATIONS: Non-English articles were excluded; therefore, the transferability
of findings to other populations is unclear.
CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with CKD experience physical and psychosocial frailty 
and feel ambivalent about prolonging life. Some caregivers believe in providing
relief from suffering, but are uncertain about making decisions regarding
dialysis therapy initiation and discontinuation. We suggest that CKD management
should encompass palliative care strategies that promote emotional resilience,
sense of well-being, and self-value. Also, respectful and attentive communication
may empower patients to convey their values and preferences about their own care.

Older people constitute an increasingly greater proportion of patients with
advanced CKD, including those patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment.
Frailty is a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors
that results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and
causes vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty is common in elderly CKD
patients, and it may be associated with protein-energy wasting (PEW), sarcopenia,
dynapenia, and other complications of CKD. Causes of frailty with or without PEW 
in the elderly with CKD can be classified into three categories: causes primarily
caused by aging per se, advanced CKD per se, or a combination of both conditions.
Frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients are associated with impaired physical
performance, disability, poorer quality of life, and reduced survival. Prevention
and treatment of these conditions in the elderly CKD patients often require a
multifaceted approach. Here, we examine the causes and consequences of these
conditions and examine the interplay between frailty and PEW in elderly CKD
patients.

Can quality of life be improved for the increasing numbers of older patients with

Quality of life is particularly important for older patients with end-stage
kidney disease, particularly when likely survival is short because of the burden 
of comorbidities. The features of old age and frailty make it difficult to cope
with both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Evidence exists that quality of
life is better on peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis, yet the
majority of older patients are placed on hemodialysis. Older patients should
therefore receive appropriate education to enable choice of the appropriate
dialysis modality for their lifestyle. The development of assisted peritoneal
dialysis will enable those who cannot perform their own dialysis to have their
treatment at home. Delaying dialysis to a time when it is actually needed and
discussing the option of conservative care will also improve the quality of the
end-of-life phase for patients with multiple comorbidities and with a poor
overall prognosis.
