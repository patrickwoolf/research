Advanced age is one of the major determinants of frailty in patients with
cancer-associated thrombosis. However, multiple other factors contribute to
frailty in these patients. The identification of frailty in patients with
cancer-associated thrombosis is critical as it influences the complexity of the
anticoagulant treatment in this population at high risk of venous thromboembolism
and bleeding. Factors that contribute to frailty in patients with
cancer-associated thrombosis include age, type of cancer, comorbidities such as
chronic kidney disease, poly-pharmacotherapy, treatment compliance, cognitive
impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mobility, nutritional status, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group grade, risk of falls, and reduced life expectancy. In 
the absence of specific clinical studies current anticoagulant treatment
guidelines for the management are not fully applicable to frail patients with
cancer. The anticoagulant treatment should therefore benefit from a tailored
approach based on an algorithm that takes into account the specificities of the
malignant disease.

There is interdependence between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ageing whereby 
CKD makes ageing more accelerated and pronounced, whereas ageing accelerates
chronic nephropathy's progression. Frailty status catalyzes this spiral, with
renal and systemic negative consequences, and this condition can currently be
documented by applying already validated clinical scores (frailty phenotype) or
physical test (gate speed). Although, nephroprevention strategies are similar
between young adult and senior CKD patients, standard targets should be adequate 
to very old and frail elderly individuals. For this purpose, an original
algorithm is here proposed to adjust the conventional nephroprevention strategies
to the condition of CKD frail patient (more relaxed targets and tighter control),
as well as to prescribe anti-frailty interventions to slow patient's functional
decline, hospitalization and mortality.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frail patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an
increased hospitalisation and mortality rate. However, many popular frailty
screening methods have not been validated in patients with CKD. This study
evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of several frailty screening methods in
patients with CKD G4-5 and those established on haemodialysis (G5D).
METHODS: Ninety participants with CKD G4-5D were recruited from Nephrology
Outpatient Clinics and 2 Haemodialysis Units between December 2016 and December
2017. Frailty was diagnosed using the Fried Frailty Phenotype. The following
frailty screening tests were evaluated: Clinical Frailty Scale, PRISMA-7, CKD
Frailty Index, CKD FI-LAB, walking speed, hand grip strength and Short Physical
Performance Battery.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 69 years (SD ±13). One-third of
participants were dialysis-dependent. Nineteen (21%) patients were categorised as
frail, 42 (47%) as pre-frail and 29 (32%) as robust. Overall, walking speed was
the most discriminative measure (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.93-1.00], sensitivity 0.84
[95% CI 0.62-0.94], specificity 0.96 [95% CI 0.88-0.99]). The Clinical Frailty
Scale had the best performance of the non-physical assessment frailty screening
methods (AUC 0.90 [95% CI 0.84-0.97], sensitivity 0.79 [95% CI 0.57-0.91],
specificity 0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.93]).
CONCLUSIONS: Walking speed can be used to accurately screen for frailty in CKD
populations. If it is not practical to perform a physical assessment to screen
for frailty, the Clinical Frailty Scale is a useful alternative.

A significant interaction between kidneys and lungs has been shown in
physiological and pathological conditions. The two organs can both be targets of 
the same systemic disease (eg., some vasculitides). Moreover, loss of normal
function of either of them can induce direct and indirect dysregulation of the
other one. Subjects suffering from COPD may have systemic inflammation,
hypoxemia, endothelial dysfunction, increased sympathetic activation and
increased aortic stiffness. As well as the exposure to nicotine, all the foresaid
factors can induce a microvascular damage, albuminuria, and a worsening of renal 
function. Renal failure in COPD can be unrecognized since elderly and frail
patients may have normal serum creatinine concentration. Lungs and kidneys
participate in maintaining the acid-base balance. Compensatory role of the lungs 
rapidly expresses through an increase or reduction of ventilation. Renal
compensation usually requires a few days as it is achieved through changes in
bicarbonate reabsorption. Chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal diseases
increase the risk of pneumonia. Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumonia and
seasonal influenza is recommended for these patients. Vaccines against the last
very virulent H1N1 influenza A strain are also available and effective. Acute
lung injury and acute kidney injury are frequent complications in critical
illnesses, associated with high morbidity and mortality. The concomitant failure 
of kidneys and lungs implies a multidisciplinary approach, both in terms of
diagnostic processes and therapeutic management.

AIM: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been
diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty,
but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with
frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study
to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic
hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited.
Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered
diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not
(Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the
prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined
the risk factors for frailty.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than 
that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the
association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients
(n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their
interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic
nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic
nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18:

In the case of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), physicians are facing more
and more difficulties in managing VTE and their treatment in frail patients.
These patients could present several risk situations such as: chronic kidney
disease (CKD), underweight or malnourished, falls, cognitive impairment,
multi-medicated patients, cancer and pregnancy. Guidelines typically recommend
anticoagulation. There are multiple challenges in the safe use of anticoagulation
in frail patients, including bleeding risk, monitoring and adherence, and
polypharmacy. The objective of this review is to explore these at-risk situations
and to suggest adequate anticoagulation therapy, when possible, in each of these 
complex situations.

OBJECTIVES: Frailty can cause increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes,
such as falls, fractures, depression and reduced health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition,
HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care
utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 
2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5).
METHODS: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney
disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up
study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale);
depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and
cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools.
Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights >136 kg, and coinciding
comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded.
RESULTS: Frailty occurred in 17% of participants (n=7). Frail participants had
lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more 
depression (p=<0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and
emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p<0.05). No differences in
health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail
participants (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney
disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater
depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.

BACKGROUND: We retrospectively assessed the initial clinical role of preoperative
frailty in surgical patients with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD).
METHODS: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients who underwent emergent or 
urgent surgical interventions for AAAD in our institute between April 2000 and
March 2016 participated in this retrospective study. Patients with more than
three of the following six modalities were defined as being frail: age older than
75 years, preoperative requirement of assistance in daily living, body mass index
less than 18.5 kg/m2, female, history of major stroke, and chronic kidney disease
greater than class 3b. Twenty-three patients (20.2%) were diagnosed with frailty 
(group F), while 91 patients (79.8%) were not (group N). Early clinical outcomes,
major postoperative complications, postoperative recovery of activity, and early 
or mid-term survival were evaluated.
RESULTS: Although early clinical outcomes and the prevalence of major
postoperative complications were similar in both groups, postoperative activity
of daily living (ADL), such as the rate of being ambulatory on discharge
(p < 0.05) and home discharge (p < 0.01), was significantly lower in group F than
in group N. A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 1- and 5-year survival rates
were similar in groups F (85.9 and 76.4%, respectively) and N (86.0 and 76.9%,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative frailty in AAAD surgical patients has potential as a
prognostic factor that affects delays in ADL recovery, but does not influence the
early or mid-term clinical outcomes of prompt surgical strategies for life rescue
in AAAD patients with frailty.

Aging is an important risk factor for patients with atrial fibrillation. The
estimated prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients aged ≥80 years is 9-10%, 
and is associated with a four to five fold increased risk of embolic stroke, and 
with an estimated increased stroke risk of 1.45-fold per decade in aging. Older
age is also associated with an increased risk of major bleeding with oral
anticoagulant therapy. This review will focus on the role of oral anticoagulation
with new oral anticoagulants, non-vitamin K antagonist in populations with common
comorbid conditions, including age, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery
disease, on multiple medication, and frailty. In patients 75 years and older,
randomised trials have shown new oral anticoagulants to be as effective as
warfarin, or in some cases superior, with an overall better safety profile,
consistently reducing rates of intracranial haemorrhages. Prior to considering
oral anticoagulant therapy in an elderly frail patient, a comprehensive
assessment should be performed to include the risks and benefits, stroke risk,
baseline kidney function, cognitive status, mobility and fall risk, multiple
medication, nutritional status assessment, and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cognitive and renal impairment are pervasive among elderly
frails, a high-risk, geriatric sub-population with peculiar clinical
characteristics. In a series of frail individuals with non-advanced chronic
kidney disease (CKD), we aimed at assessing the entity of functional, general
health and cognitive impairment and the possible relationship between these types
of dysfunction and the severity of renal impairment.
METHODS: 2229 geriatric subjects were screened for frailty and CKD. Severity of
CKD was assessed by eGFR (CKD-EPI formula). Frailty was established by the Fried 
Index. Functional, general health and cognitive status were assessed by validated
score measures.
RESULTS: Final analysis included 271 frail CKD subjects (162 women, 109 men).
Mean eGFR was 64.25 ± 25.04 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD
(stage 3-4) was 44%. Twenty-six percent of patients had severe cognitive
impairment, while mild and moderate impairment was found in 7 and 67% of
individuals, respectively. All subjects had poor functional and general health
status. Cognitive capacities significantly decreased across CKD stages (p for
trend < 0.0001). In fully adjusted multivariate analyses, cognitive status
remained an independent predictor of eGFR (β = 0.465; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mild-to-moderate CKD is highly pervasive among frail elderly
individuals and the severity of renal dysfunction is independently correlated
with that of cognitive impairment. Future studies are advocated to clarify
whether the combination of kidney and mental dysfunction may portend a higher
risk of worsen outcomes in this high-risk population.

The relationship between frailty and chronic kidney disease in elderly population
has been recognized; however, studies concentrating on frailty in predialysis
patients are limited. For nephrologists, the recognition of frailty is important 
as it has impact on decisions on the choice of dialysis modality and sometimes on
whether dialysis is indeed in the patients' best interests. Many of the tools for
routine assessment of frailty are not easily applicable to those clinicians not
practicing elderly care medicine. A tool needs to be simple and applicable for
daily routine practice. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and
clinical outcome of frailty in an elderly predialysis population using simple
tools. A nonrandomized prospective study was conducted in which, 104 patients
aged 65 years or above with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25 mL or
less were included. Data including age, sex, renal function, calcium, albumin,
parathormone, and comorbidities were collected at baseline and at three months
interval for one year. Functional performance was assessed using Karnofsky scale.
The Charlson comorbidity index was used to assess comorbid status of each
patient. Frailty was assessed using a combination of PRISMA questionnaire and
Timed up and Go test. End points were death or start of dialysis at 20-month
follow-up. A frail group (n = 58; males = 32, females = 26) and a nonfrail group 
(n = 46; males = 21, females = 25) were identified. Frailty was prevalent in
53.8% of the selected population. There was no significant difference between
both groups in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, hemoglobin, inflammatory
markers, or calcium hemostasis. Nine patients chose conservative management in
the frail group and six in nonfrail group. Rate of death was significantly higher
in the frail group (death = 14) compared to nonfrail group (death = 3; P = 0.01).
There was no significant difference between both groups in terms of initiation of
dialysis (P = 0.1). Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index were significantly
associated with mortality (P = 0.023 and 0.032, respectively). Survival in frail 
patients who started peritoneal dialysis (PD) was slightly better than those
started on hemodialysis (HD) with hazard ratio = 3.23 (P = 0.23). Our study shows
that the prevalence of frailty and mortality rate is high among elderly
predialysis patients. Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index are independent
predictors of outcome in this population. PD might be a better option of dialysis
modality compared to HD in the frail population.

Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of
diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, 
about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years.
Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive
impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly
more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial
disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a
consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a
considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without
any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with
type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into
account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life
expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals
and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically,
overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in
particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used
with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia
are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function
are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

Objectives The clinical condition of frailty is a common problem in the elderly
population. However, the relationship between peripheral artery disease and
frailty in hemodialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to
identify the relationships between peripheral artery disease and frailty in
Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods A total of 362 chronic
hemodialysis patients who regularly visited six institutions were enrolled. To
evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty phenotype adjusted for Japanese
were used. Peripheral artery disease was defined as ankle-brachial index <0.9.
Results Of 362 patients, 62 patients (17.1%) were categorized as peripheral
artery disease group and 300 patients (82.9%) as Non-peripheral artery disease
group. The prevalence of frailty in the peripheral artery disease group was
significantly higher than in the Non-peripheral artery disease group (34% vs.
18%, P = 0.0103). Non-shunt side grip strength was significantly stronger in the 
Non-peripheral artery disease group (23.6 kg vs. 17.0 kg, P < 0.0001). Thigh
circumferences were also significantly larger in the Non-peripheral artery
disease group (41.7 cm vs. 39.7 cm, P = 0.0054). A multivariate logistic
regression analysis demonstrated that the factors independently associated with
peripheral artery disease were as follows: frailty (odds ratio = 2.06, 95%
confidence interval 1.09-3.89) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 3.74, 95% 
confidence interval 2.05-6.83). Conclusions It is concluded that peripheral
artery disease is closely associated with frailty in hemodialysis patients.

Frailty is significantly associated with bone loss in the general population.
However, it is unclear whether this association also exists in patients
undergoing hemodialysis who have chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder
(CKD-MBD). This study aimed to assess the association between frailty and bone
loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This cross-sectional study included 214
(90 women, 124 men) Japanese outpatients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis
three times per week, with a mean age of 67.1 years (women) and 66.8 years (men).
Frailty was defined based on criteria set forth by the Cardiovascular Health
Study (CHS)-19 (21.1%) women and 47 (37.9%) men were robust, 41 (45.6%) women and
43 (34.7%) men were pre-frail, and 30 (33.3%) women and 34 (27.4%) men were
frail. For bone mass, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters (speed of sound,
broadband ultrasound attenuation, stiffness index) of the calcaneus were
measured. The association between frailty and QUS parameters was determined
separately for women and men using multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), 
with adjustments for clinical characteristics including age, body mass index,
hemodialysis vintage, diabetes, current smoking, serum albumin, phosphate,
corrected calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, and medication for CKD-MBD
(vitamin D receptor activator, calcimimetics). ANCOVA revealed that all QUS
parameters declined significantly with increasing levels of frailty in both sexes
(P < 0.05). In conclusion, frailty (as defined by CHS criteria) should be
considered a risk factor for bone loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

BACKGROUND: Aim of our study is to describe, in people with CKD, the demographic 
and clinical characteristics and outcomes with increasing age. The prevalence of 
CKD in Western populations, where longevity is the norm, is about 10-15%, but how
age influence different characteristics of patients with CKD is largely not
known.
METHODS: One thousand two hundred sixty-five patients enrolled in the CKD.QLD
registry at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital were grouped according to age
at consent i.e. <35, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, 85+ years age groups, and
were followed till start of renal replacement therapy (RRT), death, discharge or 
the censor date of September 2015.
RESULTS: Age ranged from 17.6 to 98.5 years with medians of 70.1 and 69.9 years
for males and females respectively: 7% were <35 years of age, with the majority
(63%) >65 years old. The leading renal diagnoses changed from genetic real
disease (GRD) and glomerulonephritis (GN) in the younger patients to renovascular
disease (RVD) and hypertension (HTN) in older patients. With increasing age,
there were often multiple renal disease diagnoses, more advanced stages of CKD,
greater number of comorbidities, more frequent and more costly hospitalizations, 
and higher death rates. The rates of initiation of renal replacement therapy
(RRT) rose from 4.5 per 100 person years in those age < 35 years to a maximum of 
5.5 per 100 person years in 45-54 years age group and were lowest, at 0.5 per 100
person years in those >85 years. Mortality rates increased by age group from 1.3 
to 17.0 per 100 person years in 35-44 year and 85+ year age groups respectively. 
Rates of hospitalization, length of stay and cost progressively increased from
the youngest to eldest groups. Patients with diabetic nephropathy had highest
incidence rate of RRT and death. The proportion of patients who lost more than
5mls/min/1.73m2 of eGFR during at least 12 months follow up increased from 13.3% 
in the youngest age group to 29.2% in the eldest.
CONCLUSION: This is the first comprehensive view, with no exclusions, of CKD
patients seen in a public renal specialty referral practice, in Australia. The
age distribution of patients encompasses the whole of adult life, with a broader 
range and higher median value than patients receiving RRT. Health status ranged
from a single system (renal) disease in young adults through, with advancing age,
renal impairment as a component of, or accompanying multisystem diseases, to
demands and complexities of support of frail or elderly people approaching end of
life. This great spectrum demands a broad understanding and capacity of renal
health care providers, and dictates a need for a wider scope of health services
provision incorporating multiple models of care.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. However,
apart from its influence on cognition, it is currently unknown whether frailty
affects subtler cerebral function in patients with ESRD.
METHODS: Patients with ESRD were prospectively enrolled, with clinical features
and laboratory data recorded. The severity of frailty among these patients with
ESRD was ascertained using the previously validated simple FRAIL scale, and was
categorized as none-to-mild and moderate-to-severe frailty. All participants
underwent quantitative electroencephalography (EEG), with band powers documented 
following the generation of the delta to alpha ratio (DAR) and delta/theta to
alpha/beta ratio (DTABR). EEG results were then compared between groups of
different levels of frailty.
RESULTS: In this cohort, (mean age: 68.9 ± 10.4 years, 37% male, 3.4 ± 3 years of
dialysis), 20, 60, 40, 17, and 6% patients exhibited positivity in the fatigue,
resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss-of-body-weight domains, respectively,
with 45.7% being none to mildly frail and 54.3% being moderately to severely
frail. Those with mild frailty had a significantly higher delta power compared to
those with more severe frailty, involving all topographic sites. Patients with
ESRD and severe frailty had significantly lower global, left frontal, left
temporo-occipital, and right temporo-occipital DAR and DTABR, except in the right
frontal area, and tended to have central accentuation of alpha, beta, and theta
power, and more homogeneous DTABR and DAR distribution compared to the findings
in those with mild frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in patients with ESRD can have subtler neurophysiological
influences, presenting as altered EEG findings, which warrant our attention.

Objectives　To investigate the relationship between frailty, metabolic syndrome
(MetS), and loss of independence leading to the onset of disability or death
among community-dwelling older Japanese.Methods　Between 2002 and 2011, we
conducted a 7-year prospective study involving 1,453 residents aged 65 years and 
over, initially free of disability, who underwent a comprehensive geriatric
assessment in Kusatsu town. Statistical analysis was conducted for those with
complete values, resulting in a variable number of subjects for each data point. 
Frailty was defined for 1,335 subjects as three or more of the following
criteria: weight loss (>2-3 kg in the past six months), weakness (grip strength
was <26 kg for men and <18 kg for women), exhaustion (answer of "no" to the
question "Do you feel full of energy?" on the Geriatric Depression Scale),
slowness (usual gait speed<1.0 m/s), and low physical activity (answer of "less
than once a week" to the question "How often do you usually go outdoors?"). MetS 
was defined for 1,450 subjects from the Japanese definition. The Cox
proportional-hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) of
loss of independence for 1,217 subjects.Results　During the follow-up, 494 cases
of loss of independence, including 376 disabilities and 118 deaths were
identified. In men and women, the incidence of the loss of independence showed a 
significant linear trend according to the severity classification of frailty. By 
contrast, there was no relationship between MetS and the loss of independence.
Subjects classified as prefrail and frail had an increased risk of loss of
independence compared with robust participants, with sex- and age-adjusted HRs
(95% CIs) of 1.5 (1.2-1.9) and 2.4 (1.8-3.3), respectively. After adjusting for
sex, age, the presence of MetS, low serum total cholesterol, chronic kidney
disease, anemia, low serum albumin, cognitive impairment, and past history of
stroke, the respective multivariable HRs (95% CIs) of loss of independence were
1.5 (1.2-1.9) and 2.1 (1.5-2.9). The magnitude of the risk of loss of
independence incidence for frailty was greater among the subjects aged 65-74
years than those aged ≥75 years.Conclusions　Frailty was significantly associated 
with incident loss of independence among elderly Japanese. The presence of MetS
had no effect on subsequent onset of disability and mortality in elderly
Japanese. Our findings suggest screening and intervention for frailty in the
early stage of aging are beneficial to prolong healthy life expectancy of elderly
Japanese.

Introduction: Labeling a patient as "frail" may be useful in assessing the
prognosis and therapeutic approach.
Objective: The aim of the study is to define a pattern of frailty among our
dialysis population, to analyse the incidence and clinical evolution of these
patients.
Materials and Methods: We analysed a total of 320 patients with stage V chronic
kidney disease (CKD) who were on hemodialysis between September 2014 and
September 2015. To define a patient as frail we used the Fried phenotype model,
and we added a new criteria-dialysis session length longer than 12 hours/week.
Results: 5.6% of the 320 patients were frail. We found statistically significant 
differences regarding body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin (Hgb), and serum albumin,
as well as the ability to perform the basic activities of daily living (p <
0.005), ability to ambulate (p = 0.01) and perform transfers (p < 0.005). We
found statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of
hospital admissions (p = 0.005) and mortality (p < 0.005).
Conclusion: 5.6% of the study population were frail, with lower BMI, serum
albumin and hemoglobin, lower capacity for basic activities of daily living,
ambulation, and transference, as well as higher morbidity and mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between serum β2-microglobulin (B2M) levels
and frailty in an elderly Chinese population.
DESIGN: A population-based cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data on 1,663 elderly participants (aged 70-84 
years) from the aging arm of the Rugao Longevity and Ageing study, a
population-based observational two-arm cohort study conducted in Rugao, China.
MEASUREMENTS: The serum B2M was measured with chemiluminescence immunoassay by a 
technician in the biochemistry laboratory of the Rugao People's Hospital.
Information on the frailty index and phenotype was collected.
RESULTS: The mean B2M levels and frailty index were 1.8 mg/L and 0.16,
respectively; 188 (11.3%) participants were classified as frail (frailty
phenotype). For a standard deviation increase in B2M, the adjusted odds ratio for
frailty phenotype was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.39; P=0.009) and the standardized
coefficient for frailty index was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.11; P=0.004). Relative to
the lowest quartile, the highest B2M quartile had a greater risk of prevalent
frailty with adjusted odds ratios of 1.68 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.71; P=0.034) for
frailty phenotype and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.27; P=0.044) for frailty index
(≥0.25). In addition, estimated glomerular filtration rate (based on B2M) or
chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
was significantly associated with frailty phenotype and index.
CONCLUSION: B2M was significantly associated with both frailty phenotype and
index in elderly Chinese population. The findings underscore the promising kidney
relevant biomarkers for identifying vulnerable elderly Chinese population.

AIM: To evaluate the relationship between kidney function without diabetes and
components of the frailty phenotype in community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: Participants were 8343 residents who completed baseline assessments,
classified into four categories according to eGFR. Frailty status was defined
using five criteria: (i) slow gait speed; (ii) muscle weakness; (iii) low
physical activity; (iv) exhaustion; and (v) unintentional weight loss.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with the lowest kidney
function were at higher risk of frailty (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02-3.50) than those
with normal kidney function. In addition, after adjustment for multiple
confounders, estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 was associated with a
greater risk of the individual frailty components of weight loss (OR 2.14, 95% CI
1.11-4.12), low physical activity (OR 1.35, 95% CI, 1.01-2.54) and slowness (OR
1.82, 95% CI 1.36-3.77) compared with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower kidney function was associated with a higher risk of weight
loss, low physical activity and slowness among community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 286-292.

Objectives To derive and validate a risk prediction equation to estimate the
short term risk of death, and to develop a classification method for frailty
based on risk of death and risk of unplanned hospital
admission.Design Prospective open cohort study.Participants Routinely collected
data from 1436 general practices contributing data to QResearch in England
between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used to develop the scores and a
separate set of 357 practices to validate the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 
65-100 years were in the derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the
validation cohort.Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation
cohort were used to derive separate risk equations in men and women for
evaluation of the risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age,
sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index,
medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent
investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the
validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group.
The new mortality equation was used in conjunction with the existing QAdmissions 
equation (which predicts risk of unplanned hospital admission) to classify
patients into frailty groups.Main outcome measure The primary outcome was all
cause mortality.Results During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the
derivation cohort arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The
final model included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic
group, smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the past 
12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive heart failure,
corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, learning disability,
leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, poor
mobility, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2
diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result,
high platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite loss,
unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good calibration and
high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the equation
explained 55.6% of the variation in time to death (R2), and had very good
discrimination-the D statistic was 2.29, and Harrell's C statistic value was
0.85. The corresponding values for men were 53.1%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining
predicted risks of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7% of patients 
(n=13 665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4% (n=46 770) as moderately
frail, 43.1% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8% (n=223 790) as
fit.Conclusions We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of
death in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social,
and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate
validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction with the
QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty groups (known as
QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be identified for further assessment
or interventions.

BACKGROUND: Frailty exhibits a high prevalence in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
patients and is associated with adverse health-related outcomes, including falls 
and fractures. Available studies do not address whether frailty is associated
with temporal changes in BMD. We evaluated this issue by analyzing the follow-up 
dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results in an ESRD cohort.
METHODS: In 2015, we enrolled forty-three ESRD patients, divided into frail,
pre-frail, and robust ones based on a validated simple FRAIL scale, all receiving
DXA at baseline. After one year of follow-up, survivors received another DXA, and
we calculated the absolute and percentage changes in area, bone mineral density
(BMD), T-, and Z-scores of lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN) between baseline
and follow-up examinations.
RESULTS: Among all, frail individuals with ESRD had significantly lower average
lumbar spine area, lower L4, FN, and total BMD and T-scores, lower FN and total
Z-scores than non-frail ones, without differences in gender, body mass index,
dialysis duration, and comorbidities. Furthermore, we discovered frail ESRD
patients had significantly more prominent decrease in average lumbar spine area, 
percentage changes in L1 Z-scores and average lumbar spine area, and a trend
toward more prominent decrease in L4 area than non-frail ones after one year of
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline frailty might be associated with deteriorating bone health,
including shrinking L-spine areas and a more rapid decrease in L-spine Z scores, 
among ESRD patients. This frailty-bone association should be highlighted during
our care of frail individuals with ESRD.

OBJECTIVES: The clinical practice guidelines published by the Renal Physicians
Association (USA) recommend instituting advance care planning (ACP) for patients 
with end-stage renal disease. Studies on this issue are lacking in Italy. Our aim
was to determine the attitudes of patients on ACP in our dialysis centre.
METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey. We recruited patients on
maintenance haemodialysis (HD) at Hemodialysis Center of Università Cattolica del
Sacro Cuore, from 1 March 2014 to 31 March 2015. The only exclusion criterion was
inability to give an informed consent. Patients completed a questionnaire
concerning their treatment preferences in three hypothetical disease scenarios:
persistent vegetative state, advanced dementia, severe terminal illness; for each
patients, we also collected clinical, functional and socioeconomic data.
RESULTS: Thirty-four HD outpatients completed the study questionnaire. The
majority of respondents (85%) considered information about prognosis, health
conditions and treatment options, including withdrawing dialysis, as very
important and 94% of respondents considered treatment of uraemic/dialytic
symptoms the most important issue. In the health scenarios provided, dialysis was
the treatment least withheld. Dependence on instrumental activities of daily
living (0.048) and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (p=0.035) were
associated with continuing dialysis in at least one scenario.
CONCLUSIONS: ACP should be tailored to patients' value, culture and preferences. 
A significant proportion of patients, however, do not want to be involved in end 
of life decisions. Frail elderly patients, in particular, are not inclined to
interrupt dialysis, despite poor quality of life or a poor prognosis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and
associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in
frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we
examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of
Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in 
ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24
months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled
frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during
follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of
frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores
changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change,
0.2 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity
(0.6 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7
points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher
frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores
(-1.1 points per g/dl; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition,
patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become
frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction
in frailty score (95% confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the
underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included
serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of
hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and
hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at
any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic
rate was not independently associated with frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores,
with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of 
inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening
frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or 
posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.

Many patients become frail with diminished cardiorespiratory fitness while
awaiting kidney transplantation. Frailty and poor fitness powerfully predict
mortality, transplant graft survival, and healthcare utilization after kidney
transplantation. Efforts to intervene with post-transplant physical therapy have 
been met with limited success, in large part due to high study dropout. We
reviewed the literature on chronic kidney disease and exercise to propose a
clinical framework for physical therapy interventions to improve fitness,
scheduled for before the transplant. This framework may lead to better patient
retention and compliance, and thus demonstrate better efficacy in mitigating the 
effects of frailty and poor fitness after kidney transplantation.

Frailty is a common complication in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) under dialysis, which is a strong risk factor for low quality of life,
morbidity, and mortality. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of
frailty in a group of Portuguese ESRD patients, and its association with
socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. We performed a
cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3
[±14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients
as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire.
Social support, data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and
haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory
markers were also evaluated. Our results confirmed that frailty is a highly
prevalent condition in ESRD patients, particularly in female patients. An
association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of
hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.

Global burden disease studies point out that one of the top cause-specific
anemias is iron deficiency (ID). Recent advances in knowledge of iron homeostasis
have shown that fragile patients are a new target population in which the
correction of ID might impact their morbidity, mortality and quality of life. We 
did a systematic review using specific search strategy, carried out the review of
PubMed database, Cochrane Database of systemic reviews and international
guidelines on diagnosis and clinical management of ID from 2010 to 2016. The
International guidelines were limited to those with peer-review process and
published in journal present in citation index database. The eligible studies
show that serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are the key tests in early
decision-making process to identify iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The clinician
has to carefully consider fragile and high-risk subset of patients such as elders
or individuals with chronic diseases (i.e chronic kidney disease, inflammatory
bowel disease, chronic heart failure). Treatment is based on iron
supplementation. Infusion route should be preferentially considered in frail
patients especially in the view of new iron available formulations. The available
evidences indicate that (i) recurrent IDA should always be investigated,
considering uncommon causes; (ii) IDA might worse the performance and the
clinical outcome of fragile and high-risk patients and require an intensive
treatment.

Patients with chronic kidney disease experience substantial loss of muscle mass, 
weakness, and poor physical performance. As kidney disease progresses, skeletal
muscle dysfunction forms a common pathway for mobility limitation, loss of
functional independence, and vulnerability to disease complications. Screening
for those at high risk for mobility disability by self-reported and objective
measures of function is an essential first step in developing an
interdisciplinary approach to treatment that includes rehabilitative therapies
and counseling on physical activity. Exercise has beneficial effects on systemic 
inflammation, muscle, and physical performance in chronic kidney disease. Kidney 
health providers need to identify patient and care delivery barriers to exercise 
in order to effectively counsel patients on physical activity. A thorough medical
evaluation and assessment of baseline function using self-reported and objective 
function assessment is essential to guide an effective individualized exercise
prescription to prevent function decline in persons with kidney disease. This
review focuses on the impact of kidney disease on skeletal muscle dysfunction in 
the context of the disablement process and reviews screening and treatment
strategies that kidney health professionals can use in clinical practice to
prevent functional decline and disability.

Optimizing the Management of Uncontrolled Hypertension: What do Triple Fixed-Dose
Drug Combinations Add?

Fixed-dose triple drug combinations represent one of the latest innovations of
pharmacotherapy for hypertension (HT). They combine a traditional
renin-angiotensin system blocker, a diuretic and a calcium channel blocker. The
main benefit is the simplification of treatment regimen because 3 different
agents are combined at different doses in a single pill. Improving adherence to
treatment partly explains why this kind of combination may effectively reduce
blood pressure (BP). BP lowering by a single- pill triple-drug combination can be
approximately predicted, by using appropriate formulas described in previous
meta-analysis of randomized trials. Thus, clinicians may select the appropriate
dose for each of the combined drugs. Selection of different types of fixed-dose
triple-drug combinations relies upon clinical experience, commercial availability
and evidence from clinical trials and metaanalyses for each agent alone. However,
triple fixed-dose drug combinations should be reserved only for patients with
uncontrolled BP with 2 agents, poor adherence in complex therapeutic regimens or 
on inappropriate free-drug combinations. Also, triple therapy may help overcome
clinical inertia by prescribing more potent antihypertensive formulations in one 
pill. In contrast, this type of multiple-drug fixed-dose combination might be
less safe in very old and frail patients, as well as in those with chronic kidney
disease. Although new combinations may help overcome the clinical inertia of
achieving individualized BP targets, doctors should also pay attention
reinforcement of lifestyle changes.

Frailty is a distinct phenotype that is highly prevalent in chronic kidney
disease (CKD) and appears to be more prevalent with decreasing glomerular
filtration rate. Exercise training or intervention to increase physical activity 
may ameliorate poor physical functioning and frailty, and even may improve
survival in patients with CKD. Although exercise interventions improve outcomes
across the spectrum of CKD, including patients treated with dialysis, patients
treated with dialysis face barriers to exercise that patients with predialysis
CKD do not. Rehabilitation at earlier stages of CKD (or prehabilitation before
dialysis) might be more beneficial than not addressing the decreasing physical
functioning and low physical activity until patients are receiving dialysis. This
review summarizes available literature on frailty in the CKD and end-stage renal 
disease population, including exercise interventions and the limited evidence for
prehabilitation as a strategy.

BACKGROUND: The risk of incorrect medication dosing is high in frail older
people. Therefore, accurate assessment of the glomerular filtration rate is
important.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the estimated glomerular
filtration rate using creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae, the Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, in frail older
people. We hypothesized that frailty determines the difference between the
creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae.
METHODS: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C was
determined using (cross-sectional) data of 55 patients (mean age 73 years)
admitted to a psychiatric ward for older adults. The level of agreement of these 
estimations was assessed by a Bland-Altman analysis. In all patients, the
Rockwood's Frailty Index was derived and correlated with the mean difference
between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C.
RESULTS: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine (mean
71.2 mL/min/1.73 m2) and CKD-EPI cystatin C (mean 57.6 mL/min/1.73 m2) was
13.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.0001). The two standard deviation limit in the
Bland-Altman plot was large (43.2 mL/min/1.73 m2), which represents a low level
of agreement. The Frailty Index did not correlate with the mean difference
between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based glomerular filtration rate (Pearson 
correlation coefficient 0.182, p = 0.184).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant gap between a creatinine- and cystatin
C-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate, irrespective of frailty. The
range of differences between the commonly used estimated glomerular filtration
rate formulae might result in clinically relevant differences in drug
prescription and differences in chronic kidney disease staging.

The population of patients with moderate and severe CKD is growing. Frail and
older patients comprise an increasing proportion. Many studies still exclude this
group, so the evidence base is limited. In 2013 the advisory board of ERBP
initiated, in collaboration with European Union of Geriatric Medicine Societies
(EUGMS), the development of a guideline on the management of older patients with 
CKD stage 3b or higher (eGFR >45 mL/min/1.73 m2). The full guideline has recently
been published and is freely available online and on the website of ERBP
(www.european-renal-best-practice.org). This paper summarises main
recommendations of the guideline and their underlying rationales.

The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes over the
last decade has resulted in increasing numbers of frail older patients with a
combination of these conditions. Current treatment guidelines may not necessarily
be relevant for such patients, who are mostly excluded from the trials upon which
these recommendations are based. There is a paucity of data upon which to base
the management of older patients with CKD. Nearly all current guidelines
recommend less-tight glycaemic control for the older population, citing the lack 
of proven medium-term benefits and concerns about the high short-term risk of
hypoglycaemia. However, reports from large landmark trials have shown potential
benefits for both microvascular and macrovascular complications, though the
relevance of these findings to this specific population is uncertain. The trials 
have also highlighted potential alternative explanations for the hazards of
intensive glycaemic control. These include depression, low endogenous insulin
reserve, low body mass index and side effects of the medication. Over the last
few years, newer classes of hypoglycaemic drugs with a lower risk of
hypoglycaemia have emerged. This article aims to present a balanced view of
advantages and disadvantages of intense glycaemic control in this group of
patients, which we hope will help the clinician and patient to come to an
individualized management approach.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review and
meta-analysis on prevalence of frailty among patients with end-stage renal
disease (ESRD). ESRD is associated with malnutrition, chronic inflammation,
acidemia, impaired hormonal changes, and low physical activity, all of which can 
directly and indirectly contribute to the development of frailty. Coexistence of 
ESRD and frailty has been shown to increase risks of adverse health outcomes.
Given potential reversibility of frailty, it is important to examine frailty
status in this high-risk population.
METHODS: Three databases (EMBASE, Medline, and CINAHL) were systematically
searched for studies providing cross-sectional data of prevalence of frailty
defined by cardiovascular health study (CHS) criteria among ESRD patients.
Meta-analysis calculated pooled prevalence of frailty according to modifications 
of CHS criteria.
RESULTS: Of 837 studies identified through the systematic review, seven studies
were included. Three studies used both objectively measured and self-reported CHS
criteria, and two studies each used only either criteria. Pooled prevalence of
frailty was 36.8% (five studies: 95% CI = 29.9-44.1%, I 2 = 82.6%, p < 0.001) and
67.0% (five studies: 95% CI = 58.7-74.7%, I 2 = 96.5%, p < 0.001) according to
the objectively measured and self-reported CHS criteria, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of ESRD patients were frail based on the
objectively measured CHS criteria, and that prevalence of frailty almost doubled 
with the CHS criteria substituting self-reported physical function questionnaire 
score for objective measurements. Given substantial difference in prevalence of
frailty depending on the modifications to CHS criteria, this information should
be taken into account when evaluating frailty status among ESRD population.

Elevated blood pressure is one of the most significant risk factor for the
development of chronic kidney disease (CKD); its treatment is a milestone in CKD 
management. While it is accepted that a stricter blood pressure control is
indicated in patients with proteinuria or microalbuminuria, the exact degree of
blood pressure reduction to be obtained in CKD patients is still under debate.
Following more recent interpretation of old trials, a BP target for <140/90 mmHg 
is suggested for non-proteinuric CKD patients. In those with
microalbuminuria/proteinuria, the ideal blood pressure target should be ≤130/80
mmHg. Recently, the SPRINT trial put new emphasis on a stricter blood pressure
control, mainly from the cardiovascular point of view. The blockers of the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are recommended as first line treatment in all CKD
hypertensive patients with micro or macroalbuminuria either diabetics or not.
However, their nephroprotective efficacy is less relevant in non-proteinuric
patients. The dual RAS blockade was proposed as an additional option. Despite a
greater antiproteinuric effect, some large trials in patients at high
cardiovascular risk did not demonstrate significant advantage on hard endpoint.
Its use is now contraindicated in diabetic CKD patients. Given that RAS blockers 
can cause acute derangements in kidney function and hyperkalemia, caution is
needed with their use, especially in frail and old patients with cardiovascular
disease or in the presence of advanced CKD.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical implications of frailty in chronic kidney 
disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and chronic peritoneal
dialysis.
DESIGN: In this prospective study, all of the participants completed the Short
Form of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, Korean version, to
determine their frailty phenotype. We also obtained blood chemistry and
demographic data at enrollment. Data regarding the history of hospitalization and
death were collected during the follow-up period.
SUBJECTS: We recruited 1,658 patients (1,255 maintenance hemodialysis and 403
chronic peritoneal dialysis) from multidialysis units (n = 27). We excluded
patients who had been hospitalized in the previous 3 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalization and survival rate during study period.
RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 55.2 ± 11.9 years old, and 55.2% were
male. Among the participants, 34.8% were rated as frail and 45.7% as prefrail.
Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant associations of frailty with age, 
comorbidity, disability, unemployment, higher body mass index, and a lower
educational level. During the follow-up period (median 17.1 months), 608 patients
(79 not frail, 250 prefrail, and 279 frail) were hospitalized, and 87 patients
(10 not frail, 24 prefrail, and 53 frail) died (P < .001). Frailty was associated
with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval:
1.38-2.36) and mortality (hazard ratio, 2.37, 95% confidence interval:
1.11-5.02).
CONCLUSION: The frailty phenotype was common even in, prevalent end-stage renal
disease patients on dialysis, and was significantly associated with higher rates 
of hospitalization and mortality.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) mainly targets the liver but can also induce extrahepatic
manifestations. The kidney may be impacted via an immune mediated mechanism or a 
cytopathic effect. HCV patients are clearly at a greater risk of chronic kidney
disease (CKD) than uninfected patients are, and the presence of CKD increases
mortality. Interferon-based therapies and ribavirin are difficult to manage and
are poorly effective in end-stage renal disease and hemodialysis. These patients 
should be given priority treatment with new direct anti-viral agents (DAAs) while
avoiding peginterferon and ribavirin. The first results were convincing. To aid
in the correct use of these drugs in patients with renal insufficiency, their
pharmacokinetic properties and potential renal toxicity must be known. The renal 
toxicity of these new drugs was not a safety signal in clinical trials, and the
drugs are generally efficient in these frail populations. These drugs are usually
well tolerated, but recent cohort studies have demonstrated that these new
regimens may be associated with renal side effects, especially when using
sofosbuvir combinations. HCV, renal diseases and comorbidities are intimately
linked. The close monitoring of renal function is required, particularly for
at-risk patients (transplanted, HIV-coinfected, CKD, hypertensive or diabetic
patients). New DAA regimens, which will soon be approved, will probably change
the landscape.

BACKGROUND: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including 
adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key
consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures
of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with
complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013).
PREDICTORS: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated
using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine
albumin-creatinine ratio.
OUTCOME: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty
characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical
activity).
RESULTS: 341 (7%) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30%) had
eGFRcr<60mL/min/1.73m2, 2,480 (50%) had eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2, and 1,006 (20%) 
had albuminuria with albumin excretion ≥ 30mg/g. Among frail participants,
prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2 were 45% and 77%, respectively.
Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a 
strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals
with eGFRcr of 60 to <75mL/min/1.73m2 were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR 
categories using eGFRcys (49% to 45-<60, 32% to 30-<45, and 3%
to <30mL/min/1.73m2). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking ≥10 classes of medications) was
more common in frail individuals (54% vs 38% of nonfrail), including classes
requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent
complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants).
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, 
with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys
versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic
kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative
biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this
vulnerable population.

The Need for Accurate Risk Prediction Models for Road Mapping, Shared Decision
Making and Care Planning for the Elderly with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease.

Stryckers M, Nagler EV, Van Biesen W.

As people age, chronic kidney disease becomes more common, but it rarely leads to
end-stage kidney disease. When it does, the choice between dialysis and
conservative care can be daunting, as much depends on life expectancy and
personal expectations of medical care. Shared decision making implies adequately 
informing patients about their options, and facilitating deliberation of the
available information, such that decisions are tailored to the individual's
values and preferences. Accurate estimations of one's risk of progression to
end-stage kidney disease and death with or without dialysis are essential for
shared decision making to be effective. Formal risk prediction models can help,
provided they are externally validated, well-calibrated and discriminative;
include unambiguous and measureable variables; and come with readily applicable
equations or scores. Reliable, externally validated risk prediction models for
progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage kidney disease or mortality in
frail elderly with or without chronic kidney disease are scant. Within this
paper, we discuss a number of promising models, highlighting both the strengths
and limitations physicians should understand for using them judiciously, and
emphasize the need for external validation over new development for further
advancing the field.

The scope of this article is to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors
associated with the frailty of elderly people with chronic kidney disease on
hemodialysis. This involved a correlational, cross-sectional study conducted in a
dialysis center in the state of São Paulo. The sample consisted of 60
participants. The Participant Characterization Instrument was used for extracting
sociodemographic and clinical data and the Edmonton Frail Scale was used to
evaluate the level of frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
identify the factors associated with frailty. The mean age of the 60 patients
included was 71.1 (± 6.9) years, predominantly male (70%), of which 36.7% were
classified as frail. With respect to the factors associated with frailty among
the variables of gender, age, self-reported skin color, schooling, monthly per
capita income, hemodialysis time, number of associated diseases, falls in the
year, hematocrit level, parathyroid hormone and use of calcitriol, it was found
that only the monthly per capita income was significantly associated with frailty
(OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.1-0.9; p = 0.04). There was an association between frailty
and income, showing that the elderly most at risk of frailty were those with
lower income.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is associated with increased vulnerability to poor health.
There is growing interest in understanding the association between frailty and
chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review explored how frailty is
measured in patients with CKD and the association between frailty and adverse
outcomes across different stages of renal impairment.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic analysis of peer reviewed articles.
DATA SOURCES: Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane were used to identify 
the articles.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Articles published before the 17th of September 2016, that
measured frailty in patients with CKD was eligible for the systematic review. Two
independent researchers assessed the eligibility of the articles. Quality of the 
articles was assessed using the Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 540 articles, of which 32 met the study
criteria and were included in the review (n=36,076, age range: 50-83 years).
Twenty-three (72%) studies used or adapted the Fried phenotype to measure
frailty. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 7% in community-dwellers (CKD
Stages 1-4) to 73% in a cohort of patients on haemodialysis. The incidence of
frailty increased with reduced glomerular filtration rate. Frailty was associated
with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is prevalent in patients with CKD and it is associated with
an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. There are differences in the
methods used to assess frailty and this hinders comparisons between studies.

disease?

Metabolic acidosis is common in advanced chronic kidney disease and has been
associated with a range of physiological derangements of importance to the health
of older people. These include associations with skeletal muscle weakness,
cardiovascular risk factors, and bone and mineral disorders that may lead to
fragility fractures. Although metabolic acidosis is associated with accelerated
decline in kidney function, end-stage renal failure is a much less common outcome
in older, frail patients than cardiovascular death. Correction of metabolic
acidosis using bicarbonate therapy is commonly employed, but the existing
evidence is insufficient to know whether such therapy is of net benefit to older 
people. Bicarbonate is bulky and awkward to take, may impose additional sodium
load with effects on fluid retention and blood pressure, and may cause
gastrointestinal side effects. Trial data to date suggest potential benefits of
bicarbonate therapy on progression of renal disease and nutrition, but trials
have not as yet been published examining the effect of bicarbonate therapy across
a range of domains relevant to the health of older people. Fortunately, a number 
of trials are now underway that should allow us to ascertain whether bicarbonate 
therapy can improve physical function, quality of life, and vascular, bone and
kidney health in older people, and hence decide whether any benefits seen
outweigh adverse effects and additional treatment burden in this vulnerable group
of patients.

Metformin (MF) accumulation during acute kidney injury is associated with high
anion gap lactic acidosis type B (MF-associated lactic acidosis, MALA), a serious
medical condition leading to high mortality. Despite dose adjustment for renal
failure, diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III-IV are at 
risk for rapid decline in renal function by whatever reason, so that MF toxicity 
might arise if the drug is not timely withdrawn. Sixteen consecutive patients
were admitted to our Hospital's Emergency Department with clinical findings
consistent with MALA. Fifteen had prior history of CKD, 60 % of them with GFR
between 30 and 60 ml/min. Of these, 5 required mechanical ventilation and
cardiovascular support; 3 promptly recovered renal function after rehydration,
whereas 10 (62 %) required continuous veno-venous renal replacement treatment.
SOFA and SAPS II scores were significantly related to the degree of lactic
acidosis. In addition, lactate levels were relevant to therapeutic choices, since
they were higher in dialyzed patients than in those on conservative treatment
(11.92 mmol/l vs 5.7 mmol/l, p = 0.03). The overall death rate has been 31 %,
with poorer prognosis for worse acidemia, as serum pH was significantly lower in 
non-survivors (pH 6.96 vs 7.16, p > 0.04). Our own data and a review of the
literature suggest that aged, hemodynamically frail patients, with several
comorbidities and CKD, are at greater risk of MALA, despite MF dosage adjustment.
Moreover, renal replacement therapy rather than simple acidosis correction by
administration of alkali seems the treatment of choice, based on eventual renal
recovery and overall outcome.

Older adults with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience functional
impairment that can complicate CKD management. Failure to recognize functional
impairment may put these individuals at risk of further functional decline,
nursing home placement, and missed opportunities for timely goals-of-care
conversations. Routine geriatric assessment could be a useful tool for
identifying older adults with CKD who are at risk of functional decline and
provide contextual information to guide clinical decision-making. Two innovative 
programs were implemented in the Veterans Health Administration that incorporate 
geriatric assessment into a nephrology visit. In one program, a geriatrician
embedded in a nephrology clinic used standardized geriatric assessment tools with
individuals with CKD aged 70 and older (Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment for
CKD) (CGA-4-CKD). In the second program, a nephrology clinic used comprehensive
appointments for individuals aged 75 and older to conduct geriatric assessments
and CKD care (Renal Silver). Data on 68 veterans who had geriatric assessments
through these programs between November 2013 and May 2015 are reported. In
CGA-4-CKD, difficulty with one or more activities of daily living (ADLs), history
of falls, and cognitive impairment were each found in 27.3% of participants. ADL 
difficulty was found in 65.7%, falls in 28.6%, and cognitive impairment in 51.6% 
of participants in Renal Silver. Geriatric assessment guided care processes in
45.4% (n = 15) of veterans in the CGA-4-CKD program and 37.1% (n = 13) of those
in Renal Silver. Findings suggest there is a significant burden of functional
impairment in older adults with CKD. Knowledge of this impairment is applicable
to CKD management.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney
function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in
community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level,
and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0
(normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Frailty status
was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle
weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of
having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were more frail
(odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition,
individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or
hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of
frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. 
Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty 
in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI
1.13-14.1) CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a
higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Geriatr

Symptom Management in Patients with Stage 5 CKD Opting for Conservative
Management.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3-5 now affects 8.5% of adults in the United 
Kingdom; with 4% of patients expected to reach stage 5 CKD. Increasing numbers of
older patients are contributing to the growth of demand of kidney services. With 
the exception of transplantation, dialysis has been the main form of renal
replacement therapy (RRT) for advanced CKD. This elderly population is usually
too frail and has many other co-existing medical complaints or co morbidities to 
undergo transplantation. Dialysis is an invasive treatment, and some frail
elderly patients can experience many dialysis related symptoms. An alternative
option for these patients is to choose conservative management (CM) of their
stage 5 CKD. These patients often have complex supportive and palliative care
needs. The frequency, severity and distress caused by symptoms related to stage 5
CKD are often under recognized and under treated. There is a need for early
identification and management of symptoms as they present in patients with stage 
5 CKD being managed conservatively. Symptom assessment should be focused on
anticipating, identifying and alleviating any symptoms. This needs to be
incorporated into the regular practice of those managing CM patients.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this quality improvement project was to evaluate
hypertension (HTN) management in patients 80 years of age and older who reside in
a large, long-term care (LTC) facility.
DATA SOURCE: A retrospective chart audit was conducted on 75 charts of patients
80 years of age and older and who had a diagnosis of HTN. Using the 2011 American
College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) Expert
Consensus Document on Management of Hypertension in the Elderly as a guide, blood
pressure readings, significant comorbidities, and antihypertensive medication
utilization were analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: LTC residents in this sample were often not treated according to
expert recommendations. Specifically, analysis revealed overtreatment of
uncomplicated HTN and undertreatment of those with comorbid conditions.
Additionally, those with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease were
infrequently prescribed ace inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, as
recommended.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Utilizing evidence-based practice (EBP) guidelines
affords the best avenue for providing safe and effective treatment of HTN. While 
expert recommendations are available, researchers seldom recruit frail elders in 
LTC facilities into treatment investigations. In the absence of
population-specific EBP guidelines, nurse practitioners must rely on expert
opinion and diagnostic reasoning to individualize HTN treatment to this unique
and vulnerable population.

A 79-year-old moderately frail man with a history of graft replacement for
descending thoracic aortic aneurysm and chronic kidney disease presented with the
onset of haemoptysis. Computed tomography demonstrated aorto-oesophageal fistula 
secondary to aortic arch aneurysm rupture. Emergency surgery was performed
through a median sternotomy. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established via femoral
artery inflow and bicaval venous drainage. After establishing circulatory arrest,
the aortic arch was excised. Resection of the aortic aneurysm and debridement
were performed during antegrade cerebral perfusion and lower body perfusion from 
femoral artery inflow using balloon occlusion of the previous graft. Aortic arch 
graft replacement with concomitant debridement of mediastinal tissue and direct
repair of oesophageal perforation comprised a first-stage operation. Forty hours 
later, abundant irrigation of warm normal saline around the mediastinal cavity
and the omental flap covering the graft and the repair site of the oesophagus
comprised the second-stage operation. Although the postoperative course was
complicated, the patient resumed oral intake within 2 months after the initial
operation. Serial computed tomography and oesophageal endoscopy showed good
healing of the aorto-oesophageal fistula. There were no clinical manifestations
or imaging findings of deep mediastinal infection throughout the postoperative
course.

AIMS: To describe the characteristics and associated risk factors of patients
with established diabetes who required Emergency Department (ED) care for severe 
hypoglycemia.
METHODS: We performed an observational retrospective study to identify all cases 
of severe hypoglycemia among attendees at the EDs of three Italian University
hospitals from January 2010 to December 2014.
RESULTS: Overall, 520 patients with established diabetes were identified. Mean
out-of-hospital blood glucose concentrations at the time of the hypoglycemic
event were 2.2 ± 1.3 mmol/L. Most of these patients were frail and had multiple
comorbidities. They were treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs (43.6%), insulin
(42.8%), or both (13.6%). Among the oral hypoglycemic drugs, glibenclamide
(54.5%) and repaglinide (25.7%) were the two most frequently used drugs, followed
by glimepiride (11.3%) and gliclazide (7.5%). Hospitalization rates and
in-hospital deaths occurred in 35.4% and in 2.3% of patients, respectively.
Cirrhosis (odds ratio [OR] 6.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-36.8,
p < 0.05), chronic kidney disease (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.11-8.69, p < 0.05) and
center (Sapienza University OR 3.70, 95% CI 1.57-8.69, p < 0.05) were the
strongest predictors of increased rates of hospital admission.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe hypoglycemia is a remarkable burden for patients with
established diabetes and increases the risk of adverse clinical outcomes
(in-hospital death and hospitalization), mainly in elderly and frail patients.
This study further reinforces the notion that careful attention should be taken
by health care providers when they prescribe drug therapy in elderly patients
with serious comorbidities.

Relationship Between Age and Pre-End Stage Renal Disease Care in Elderly Patients
Treated with Maintenance Hemodialysis.

Harford R, Clark MJ, Norris KC, Yan G.

Receipt of pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) clinical care can improve outcomes 
for patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis (HD). This study addressed
age-related variations in receipt of a composite of recommended care to include
nephrologist and dietician care, and use of an arteriovenous fistula at first
outpatient maintenance HD. Less than 2% of patients treated with maintenance HD
received all three forms of pre-ESRD care, and 63.3% received none of the three
elements of care. The mean number of pre-ESRD care elements received by the
oldest group (80 years and older) did not differ from the youngest group (less
than 55 years), but was less than the 55 to 66 and 67 to 79 years groups;
adjusted ratios of 0.93 (0.92 to 0.94; p < 0.001) and 0.94 (0.92 to 0.95; p <
0.001), respectively. A major effort is needed to ensure comprehensive pre-ESRD
care for all patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially for 
the youngest and oldest patient groups, who were less likely to receive
recommended pre-ESRD care.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

Real-world characteristics of hospitalized frail elderly patients with atrial
fibrillation: can we improve the current prescription of anticoagulants?

BACKGROUND: In elderly patients, especially those older than 80 years, atrial
fibrillation (AF) is associated with an almost 25% increased risk of stroke.
Stroke prophylaxis with anticoagulants is therefore highly recommended. The
prevalence of factors that have been associated with a lower rate of prescription
and adherence to anticoagulant therapy in these patients is little known. The
objective of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics of elderly
subjects, with and without AF, consecutively admitted to an acute geriatric unit,
discussing factors that may decrease the persistence on stroke prophylaxis
therapy. We also highlight possible strategies to overcome the barriers
conditioning the current underuse of oral anticoagulants in this segment of the
population.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed on a cohort of elderly
patients with and without AF admitted to the Acute Geriatric Unit of San Gerardo 
Hospital (Monza, Italy).
RESULTS: Compared to patients without AF (n = 1216), those with AF (n = 403) had 
a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (3 vs. 2, P < 0.001), number of administered 
drugs (4 vs. 3, P < 0.001), rate of heart failure (36.5% vs. 12%, P < 0.001) and 
chronic kidney disease (20.6 vs. 13.2, P < 0.001). Many patients with AF were
frail (54%) or pre-frail (29%).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with AF have higher rates of conditions that affect
adherence to traditional anticoagulant therapy (vitamin K antagonists, VKA). New 
direct oral anticoagulants (DOAs) can help overcome this problem. In order to
prescribe the most appropriate VKA or DOAs, with the best efficacy/safety profile
and the highest compliance, a comprehensive geriatric assessment should always
accompany the scores for thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk stratification.

INTRODUCTION: The number of elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease
(ACKD) has increased in recent years, and the best therapeutic approach has not
been determined due to a lack of evidence.
OBJECTIVES: To observe the progression of elderly patients with ACKD (stages 4
and 5) and to compare the survival of stage 5 CKD patients with and without
dialysis treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients ≥70 years who began ACKD follow-up from
01/01/2007 to 31/12/2008 were included, and their progression was observed until 
31/12/2013. Demographic data, the Charlson comorbidity index, history of
ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) were assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 314 patients ≥70 years with stages 4 and 5 CKD were studied. 
Of these patients, 162 patients had stage 5 CKD at the beginning of follow-up or 
progressed to stage 5 during the study, and 69 of these patients were treated
with dialysis. In the stage 5 group: median age was 77 years (74-81); 48% had
IHD; 50% had DM, Charlson 7 (6-9). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis: ≥70 years (93 
vs. 69 patients with dialysis, log rank: 15 P<.001); patients ≥75 years (74 vs.
46 patients with dialysis, log rank: 8.9 P=.003); patients ≥80 (40 vs. 15
patients with dialysis) and p=0,2. Patients receiving dialysis were younger, with
a lower Charlson comorbidity index and shorter follow-up time.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that dialysis treatment improves survival, although 
this benefit is lost in patients ≥80 years.

[How I TREAT ... THE ROLE OF DPP-4 INHIBITORS (GLIPTINS) IN THE TREATMENT OF TYPE
2 DIABETES].

[Article in French]

Scheen AJ.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (gliptins) are more and more prominent 
medications in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), with five molecules
commercialized and as many fixed-dose combinations with metformin. After failure 
of metformin monotherapy, gliptins compete with old medications such as
sulphonylureas, on the one hand, or with new oral antidiabetic agents such as
inhibitors of renal sodium-glucose cotransporters type 2 (SGLT2) (gliflozines),
on the other hand. Another alternative is the use of an incretin mimetic (agonist
of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors, to be injected subcutaneously) rather than 
an incretin enhancer such as a gliptin, before considering insulin therapy. This 
article analyses the arguments in favour of DPP-4 inhibitors. We will mainly
consider the use of gliptins in patients with recently diagnosed T2D, in elderly 
and frail patients and in those with chronic kidney disease. To illustrate the
discussion, we will analyze the results of both interventional and observational 
studies with vildagliptin. Obviously, these various groups of patients represent 
a large proportion of T2D population.

BACKGROUND: The dialysis population is aging worldwide. It is well known that
patients on dialysis have limited functional status, but only recently has
frailty been considered.
SUMMARY: The prevalence of frailty among patients on dialysis ranges from 3.4- to
10-fold higher than among community-dwelling elderly, depending on the method of 
assessing frailty and patient characteristics. Despite its high prevalence and
the high overall mortality in the dialysis population, frailty is associated with
higher mortality, independent of clinical and demographic characteristics and
comorbidity. The prevalence of frailty among patients with non-dialysis-dependent
chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also high, and cross-sectional data suggest that 
the prevalence may increase as CKD progresses. Thus, interventions to improve
frailty have the potential to improve quality of life and mortality. Although
interventions to improve physical dysfunction have been successful in the
population with end-stage renal disease, no studies have specifically targeted
frail individuals. Therefore, the extent to which exercise or physical activity
interventions are feasible among frail patients and can improve frailty urgently 
needs to be examined. In the meantime, providers should refer frail patients to
physical therapists and encourage them to be more active if possible. In
addition, more attention should be focused on the possibility that rehabilitation
among patients with earlier stages of CKD could improve dialysis outcomes.
KEY MESSAGES: Frailty is extremely common among patients on dialysis and is
independently associated with adverse outcomes. Providers should take advantage
of available resources to improve functioning in this population, and research
should address the optimal strategy for addressing frailty, including timing of
intervention.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Novel urinary kidney damage biomarkers detect AKI
after cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB-AKI). Although there is
growing focus on whether AKI leads to CKD, no studies have assessed whether novel
urinary biomarkers remain elevated long term after CPB-AKI. We assessed whether
there was clinical or biomarker evidence of long-term kidney injury in patients
with CPB-AKI.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We performed a cross-sectional
evaluation for signs of chronic kidney injury using both traditional measures and
novel urinary biomarkers in a population of 372 potentially eligible children
(119 AKI positive and 253 AKI negative) who underwent surgery using
cardiopulmonary bypass for congenital heart disease at Cincinnati Children's
Hospital Medical Center between 2004 and 2007. A total of 51 patients (33 AKI
positive and 18 AKI negative) agreed to long-term assessment. We also compared
the urinary biomarker levels in these 51 patients with those in healthy controls 
of similar age.
RESULTS: At long-term follow-up (mean duration±SD, 7±0.98 years), AKI-positive
and AKI-negative patients had similarly normal assessments of kidney function by 
eGFR, proteinuria, and BP measurement. However, AKI-positive patients had higher 
urine concentrations of IL-18 (48.5 pg/ml versus 20.3 pg/ml [P=0.01] and 20.5
pg/ml [P<0.001]) and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) (5.9 ng/ml
versus 3.9 ng/ml [P=0.001] and 3.2 ng/ml [P<0.001]) than did AKI-negative
patients and healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Novel urinary biomarkers remain elevated 7 years after an episode of
CPB-AKI in children. However, there is no conventional evidence of CKD in these
children. These biomarkers may be a more sensitive marker of chronic kidney
injury after CPB-AKI. Future studies are needed to understand the clinical
relevance of persistent elevations in IL-18, kidney injury molecule-1, and L-FABP
in assessments for potential long-term kidney consequences of CPB-AKI.

Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of complexity, which is an
essential condition for making the organism capable of keeping homeostasis. Thus,
senile loss of complexity makes old individuals frail: a syndrome characterized
by the presence of shrinking (sarcopenia), weakness, poor endurance and energy,
slowness, and low physical activity. Moreover, renal ageing progressively leads
to a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction, one of the main pharmacokinetic 
senile changes, which is not detectable by simply evaluating serum urea or
creatinine values but measuring or calculating patient's GFR. Finally, current
epidemiology has documented that detrimental social-behavioral factors such as
low education level, poor financial-resource, depression, and isolation, also
influence the onset and progression of chronic diseases, and even overall
mortality, particularly in the elderly. Thus, we propose that these 3 variables: 
frailty phenotype, senile GFR, and detrimental social-behavioral factors, should 
be considered at time of prescribing drugs or medical procedures in the elderly. 
Additionally, they should also be considered for following patient's response to 
prescribed therapies in elderly patients suffering from chronic diseases
(diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, etc.), or on organ replacement
treatments (dialysis and transplantation).

BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of falling is complex, and identification of risk
factors may be essential for prevention. The relationship between renal disease
and falls is unclear, and the goal of this study was to collect the available
evidence and investigate the relationship between accidental falls and renal
dysfunction.
METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in the MEDLINE, Scopus, Ovid SP and
Web of Science databases to identify the appropriate literature. The themes used 
were: falls (combined in the title/abstract fall or falls or falling or faller*
or fallen or slip* or trip* or (MeSH) accidental falls) and renal insufficiency
(chronic or renal insufficiency or kidney diseases combined in title/abstract
renal disease* or kidney disease* or renal insufficiency or kidney insufficiency 
or kidney failure or renal failure or MeSH renal insufficiency, chronic or renal 
insufficiency or kidney diseases). The incidence, risk factors, complications,
and characteristics of the falls were analyzed.
RESULTS: Eight prospective cohorts including five cross-sectional studies, and
one case-control study were identified. No randomized controlled studies were
found. The incidence of falls in chronic kidney disease patients ranged between
1.18 and 1.60 fall/patient year. These were frequent in frail older adults on
hemodialysis treatment. Falling relapses in the same group of patients caused
serious consequences. Data on pre-end stage renal disease (ESRD) were scarce.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of falling appears to be common in patients with renal
dysfunction especially in older adults undergoing hemodialysis. On the other
hand, we could not find any conclusive data on pre-ESRD patients.

The management of diabetes in older people is often challenging and poorly
researched. The prevalence of cognitive impairment, chronic kidney disease and
other co-existing comorbidities increase with age and have a significant impact
on glycaemic control targets and treatment options. This conference examined
current clinical practice, highlighted differences in the management of diabetes 
in the older person and suggested potential areas of future research.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the
elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in
comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly
individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength,
body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and
endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined
outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were
assessed.
METHODS: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient
drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12
months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc
Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail
and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition
(DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years 
old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After 
some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30
to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; 
IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 
14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 
2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the 
casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that
frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney
disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either
worse endothelial function or mortality.

AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to 
complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and
functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total
number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and
assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD
0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified
Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P =
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good
construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the
potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for
patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

In the age of person-centered care, there is an emphasis on promoting patient
autonomy and surrogate decision maker authority in making treatment decisions
that are aligned with the patient's priorities and values. As technological
advances offer multiple clinical options with various levels and types of risks
and benefits, person-centered clinical practice encourages the incorporation of
patients' and families' heterogeneous experiences into decisions regarding
illness management. In caring for frail elderly adults, clinicians are sometimes 
faced with situations in which individuals and their surrogate decision-makers
request a treatment that the clinicians feel is clinically inappropriate. This
article provides a case example of a frail older adult with advanced chronic
kidney disease who requests dialysis despite the advice of his nephrologist to
pursue conservative management. The four-box approach, which provides clinicians 
with a structured ethical framework to facilitate informed and ethically
justified treatment decisions, is then introduced. By considering the patient's
medical indications, preferences, quality of life, and contextual factors, how
each consideration plays a unique yet equally important role in informing
clinically responsible and person-centered care is illustrated.

BACKGROUND: The number of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease opting
for conservative management rather than dialysis is unknown but likely to be
growing as increasingly frail patients with advanced renal disease present to
renal services. Conservative kidney management includes ongoing medical input and
support from a multidisciplinary team. There is limited evidence concerning
patient and carer experience of this choice. This study will explore quality of
life, symptoms, cognition, frailty, performance decision making, costs and impact
on carers in people with advanced chronic kidney disease managed without dialysis
and is funded by the National Institute of Health Research in the UK.
METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, longitudinal study, patients will be
recruited in the UK, by renal research nurses, once they have made the decision
not to embark on dialysis. Carers will be asked to 'opt-in' with consent from
patients. The approach includes longitudinal quantitative surveys of quality of
life, symptoms, decision making and costs for patients and quality of life and
costs for carers, with questionnaires administered quarterly over 12 months.
Additionally, the decision making process will be explored via qualitative
interviews with renal physicians/clinical nurse specialists.
DISCUSSION: The study is designed to capture patient and carer profiles when
conservative kidney management is implemented, and understand trajectories of
care-receiving and care-giving with the aim of optimising palliative care for
this population. It will explore the interactions that lead to clinical care
decisions and the impact of these decisions on informal carers with the intention
of improving clinical outcomes for patients and the experiences of care givers.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition 
with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more
frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other
chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in
pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an
outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was
modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was
used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed 
using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.
RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were
significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those 
who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of
frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was
significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower
physical and mental quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in
pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential
role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of
life.

Are currently GFR estimating equations and standard Kt/V value adequate for
advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) frail elderly patients?

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) elderly patients have a reduced glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) due to the combination of ageing and chronic nephropathy
damage. This situation is very important to be taken into account in order to
prescribe an adequate medication and dialysis dose in this aged group. Besides,
cognitive and urinary incontinence problems make difficult to obtain an adequate 
24-h urine collection in order to evaluate creatinine clearance in this group.
Thus, a reliable GFR estimating equation would be very useful for assisting
elderly CKD patients. Additionally, Kt/V is the main parameter currently used for
dosing dialysis in stage V CKD young and elderly patients. However, frailty and
sarcopenia are prevalent disorders usually suffered by old people, who also
present many physiological changes that could make GFR estimating equations and
standard Kt/V value to become unreliable in this particular group. In conclusion,
based on all these facts, it seems crucial for clinical geriatric nephrology to
carefully evaluate how reliable current GFR estimating equations are, as well as 
which would be an adequate Kt/V value in CKD frail elderly patients.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

A chronic disease in older adults usually runs a course that is less predictable 
than in younger individuals. Unexplained variations in disease incidence,
prognosis, therapeutic responses, and toxicity are frequently observed among
older adults. This heterogeneity poses huge challenges to the current
one-size-fits-all health care systems, and calls for more personalized
managements of chronic diseases in older adults. Aging is characterized by
progressive deterioration of bodily functions with increasing risk of failure
over time. The entire process is hierarchically organized, and progresses from
intracellular events to changes at systemic and ultimately organism levels at
different rates among different individuals. Aging biology exerts great
influences on the development and progression of most age-related chronic
diseases. Thus, aging biology could contribute to the complexity of illnesses
that increase with age, and aging biomarkers possess a great potential to enable 
personalized health risk assessment and health care. We review evidences
supporting the roles of aging biomarkers in risk assessment of prevalent
age-related diseases. Frailty phenotype is an objectively measured indicator of
advanced-stage aging that is characterized by organism-level dysfunction. In
contrast, altered inflammation markers level signifies an earlier stage between
cellular abnormalities and systems dysfunction. Results of human observational
studies and randomized controlled trials indicate that these measures, albeit
simple, greatly facilitate classification of older patients with cancer, chronic 
kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus into groups 
that vary in disease incidence, prognosis and therapeutic response/toxicity. As
the detailed mechanisms underlying the complex biologic process of aging are
unraveled in the future, a larger array of biomarkers that correlate with
biologic aging at different stages will be discovered. Following the
translational research framework described in this article, these research
efforts would result in innovations in disease prevention and management that
address the huge unmet health needs of aging populations.

Medical Center, Sylmar, California.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors such as canagliflozin and 
dapagliflozin have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A
PubMed search was conducted of the literature from April 1996 to August 2014 to
identify all human studies related to SGLT2 inhibitors. Pertinent guidelines of
experts and the prescribing information for canagliflozin and dapagliflozin are
reviewed. SGLT2 inhibitors may be used as an add-on therapy in select and
relatively healthy older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are
overweight and have uncontrolled hypertension. These medications should be
avoided in patients who are frail, who have chronic kidney disease, and in
conjunction with insulin or sulfonylureas.

Frailty, which is a geriatric syndrome characterized by weakness, impaired
mobility, balance, and minimal reserve, is highly prevalent in the renal
population. While distinct from disability and comorbidity, some of the simplest 
and most clinically useful scales incorporate both the burden of medical symptoms
and the effect on functional independence into the evaluation of frailty. In the 
renal population, the frailty phenotype has been shown to correlate with
important outcomes such as hospitalization and survival. Further work is required
to establish if the presence of, and the treatments used for renal disease,
promote the sick role and decreased participation in exercise with overestimation
of frailty or if the frailty phenotype identifies people who may benefit from
rehabilitation and other interventions.

BACKGROUND: Environmental lead and cadmium exposure is associated with higher
risk of several age-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease,
chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis. These diseases may lead to frailty, a
geriatric syndrome characterized by diminished physiologic reserve in multiple
systems with decreased ability to cope with acute stressors. However, no previous
study has evaluated the association between lead or cadmium exposure and frailty.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study among individuals aged ≥ 60 years who participated
in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and had either
blood lead (N=5272) or urine cadmium (N=4887) determinations. Frailty was
ascertained with a slight modification of the Fried criteria, so that individuals
meeting ≥ 3 of 5 pre-defined criteria (exhaustion, low body weight, low physical 
activity, weakness and slow walking speed), were considered as frail. The
association between lead and cadmium with frailty was evaluated using logistic
regression with adjustment for relevant confounders.
RESULTS: Median (intertertile range) concentrations of blood lead and urine
cadmium were 3.9 µg/dl (2.9-4.9) and 0.62 µg/l (0.41-0.91), respectively. The
prevalence of frailty was 7.1%. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence
interval) of frailty comparing the second and third to the lowest tertile of
blood lead were, respectively, 1.40 (0.96-2.04) and 1.75 (1.33-2.31). Lead
concentrations were also associated with the frequency of exhaustion, weakness
and slowness. The corresponding odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for cadmium
were, respectively, 0.97 (0.68-1.39) and 1.55 (1.03-2.32), but this association
did not hold after excluding participants with reduced glomerular filtration
rate: 0.70 (0.43-1.14) and 1.09 (0.56-2.11), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the US older adult population, blood lead but not urine cadmium
concentrations showed a direct dose-response relationship with frailty. These
findings support that lead exposure increases frailty in older adults.

This study examined whether chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with
recurrent falls in older adults in nursing homes (NHs). We used data abstracted
over a six month period from 510 NH residents with a history of falls.
Thirty-five percent of the NH residents had CKD. In adjusted analyses, the
incidence of recurrent falls was similar in those with and without CKD [fall rate
ratio (FRR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.02]. Orthostatic
hypotension (FRR 1.52, 95% CI 1.12-2.05), history of falls during the prior six
month period (FRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.49), cane or walker use (FRR 1.64, 95% CI
1.16-2.33), and ambulatory dysfunction (FRR 1.47, 95% CI 1.23-1.75) were
independently associated with increased fall rate. CKD was not an important
predictor of falls in this cohort of nursing home residents with prior falls.
Instead, traditional fall risk factors were much more strongly associated with
recurrent falls.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) have
high morbidity, mortality, and symptom burden. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
congestive heart failure (CHF) often contribute to these burdens and should be
considered when providing recommendations for care. This review aims to summarize
recent literature relevant to the provision of palliative and end-of-life care
for patients with progressive CKD and specifically highlights issues relevant to 
those with CVD and CHF.
RECENT FINDINGS: Dialysis may not benefit older, frail patients with progressive 
CKD, especially those with other comorbidities. Patients managed conservatively
(i.e., without dialysis) may live as long as patients who elect to start
dialysis, with better preservation of function and quality of life and with fewer
acute care admissions. Decisions regarding dialysis initiation should be made on 
an individual basis, keeping in mind each patient's goals, comorbidities, and
underlying functional status. Conservative management of progressive kidney
disease is frequently not offered but is likely to benefit many older, frail
patients with comorbidities such as CHF and CVD.
SUMMARY: A palliative approach to the care of many patients with progressive CKD 
is essential to ensuring they receive appropriate quality care.

There has been a significant increase in the number of frail older patients
diagnosed with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) over the past thirty years. 
These elderly patients have high levels of comorbidity, and as a consequence the 
face of renal medicine is changing-There is an increasing need to focus on
traditionally geriatric areas of expertise such as falls prevention and
rehabilitation, and to shift our emphasis onto improving patient well-being
rather than longevity. Over the past decade, many nephrologists have found that
they are already acting as de facto "amateur geriatricians". This denies patients
both the benefits of specialist geriatric assessment, and equally importantly
denies them access to the wider geriatric multidisciplinary team. This article
describes the prevalence and underlying causes of the so-called "Geriatric
Giants" in patients with advanced CKD, and discusses possible improvements in
care that closer working with geriatricians could bring.

The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising, particularly
among the elderly population. Defining aging as successful or unsuccessful has
become clinically relevant in the last 15 years, with an increased recognition of
the frail phenotype. Frailty has been shown to be associated with CKD and poorer 
outcomes, such as death or dialysis. It is likely that the mechanisms of disease 
in CKD such as altered protein metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and
anemia accelerate normal aging and lead to worsening frailty in elderly patients 
with CKD.

Treatment with dialysis has benefitted large numbers of patients with advanced
kidney disease. It is though highly intrusive and demanding and some elderly,
frail patients may tolerate it poorly. Some of these patients who are either
approaching 'end-stage' kidney disease or 'failing' despite being on dialysis may
choose to pursue supportive or palliative approaches, partially or fully
replacing the dialysis option. Here, we describe some of the challenges
confronting these patients and present data on the attitudes and perceptions to
supportive care and end-of-life care planning of patients on haemodialysis
including some whose prognosis was poor. The main focus for these patients
appeared to be on holding on to what they had, adapting by living 'from day to
day' in the present, and continuing to hope for the best. Advance care planning
was seen as potentially useful by patients, once clarity surrounding its purpose

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide is rising markedly becoming a priority
public health problem. The progression of CKD cause functional limitation and
severe disability with poor quality of life. The aim of present review was to
highlight the effect of rehabilitation in CKD and ESRD subjects. The
rehabilitative process is unique in treating disabled people according to a
holistic approach with the aim of supporting a person's independent living and
autonomy. CKD are associated with an increased risk of functional impairment,
independent of age, gender, and co-morbidities. Clinicians should counsel
patients with CKD including frail elder people to increase physical activity
levels and target that regular physical activity including aerobic or endurance
exercises training benefits health. In old subjects with CKD and multiple
functional impairments, the traditional disease based model should be changed to 
individualized patient-centered approach that prioritizes patient preferences.
Patients receiving haemodialysis have a considerably lower exercise tolerance,
functional capacity, and more muscle wasting than healthy subjects or patients
with less severe CKD. Exercise training or comprehensive multi-dimensional
strategy and goal-oriented intervention should be also provided in ESRD older
subjects. Structured prevention programs based on reducing the risk factors for
CKD and rehabilitative strategies could reduce disability occurrence.

Frailty in the elderly is a state of vulnerability to poor resolution of
homoeostasis after a stressor event and is a consequence of cumulative decline in
many physiological systems during a lifetime. This cumulative decline depletes
homoeostatic reserves until minor stressor events trigger disproportionate
changes in health status. It is usually associated to adverse health outcomes and
to one-year mortality risk. Physical exercise has found to be effective in
preventing frailty and disability in this population. Chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is also a clinical condition where protein energy-wasting, sarcopenia and
dynapenia ,very common symptoms in the frail elderly, may occur. Moreover elderly
and CKD patients are both affected by an impaired physical performance that may
be reversed by physical exercise with an improvement of the survival rate. These 
similarities suggest that frailty may be a common pathway of aging and CKD that
may induce disability and that can be prevented by a multidimensional approach in
which physical exercise plays an important role.

Anemia is extremely common following hip fracture. Consistent data from
randomized trials show that transfusion of less blood, with a transfusion
threshold around 8 g/dL hemoglobin concentration, is preferable to a traditional 
threshold of 10 g/dL. Adoption of a lower threshold leads to at least equivalent 
clinical outcomes, with much less exposure to transfusion costs and risks. The
most common complication of transfusion is circulatory overload. Future research 
may elucidate the optimal transfusion threshold for these elderly patients and
address the specific needs of subgroups of patients, including those with acute
coronary syndrome or chronic kidney disease.

Frailty and quality of life: a cross-sectional study of Brazilian patients with
pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease.

Mansur HN, Colugnati FA, Grincenkov FR, Bastos MG.

PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces frailty and worsens quality of life
(QOL), even in the early stages of the disease and in young patients. However,
there is a lack of knowledge about the relationship between frailty and QOL in
CKD patients. Thus, we investigated this relationship in a sample of CKD
patients.
METHODS: A cross-observational study was conducted, in which 61 CKD patients
receiving pre-dialysis treatment were assessed. All participants completed the
Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used valid and reliable methods to
classify subjects as frail or non-frail according to Johansen's et al. (2007)
criteria. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used
to compare the groups. In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted
to measure associations between identified variables and frailty. We also
performed simple linear regression using the SF-36 physical and mental composite 
scores.
RESULTS: Almost half of the sample (42.6%) exhibited evidence of frailty. The
groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, and all SF-36 domains,
excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Frailty was significantly
associated with all SF-36 domains, again excluding Social Functioning and Role
Emotional. Regression analysis revealed no significant between-group differences 
in composite physical and mental health scores generated by the SF-36 (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Frail and non-frail CKD patients differed significantly in seven of
the eight SF-36 domains. The frail group displayed diminished physical and mental
functioning when their SF-36 scores were divided by their physical and mental
composite scores. Frailty was correlated with QOL domains, with the exception of 
the social domain. There is a need for interventions targeting the
characteristics of frailty, to provide better treatment and optimize overall QOL.

OBJECTIVE: The ability of nursing home residents to function independently is
associated with their quality of life. The impact of amputations on functional
status in this population remains unclear. This analysis evaluated the effect of 
amputations-transmetatarsal (TM), below-knee (BK), and above-knee (AK)--on the
ability of residents to perform self-care activities.
METHODS: Medicare inpatient claims were linked with nursing home assessment data 
to identify admissions for amputation. The Minimum Data Set Activities of Daily
Living Long Form Score (0-28; higher numbers indicating greater impairment),
based on seven activities of daily living, was calculated before and after
amputation. Hierarchical modeling determined the effect of the surgery on
postamputation function of residents. Controlling for comorbidity, cognition, and
prehospital function allowed for evaluation of Activities of Daily Living
trajectories over time.
RESULTS: In total, 4965 residents underwent amputation: 490 TM, 1596 BK, and 2879
AK. Mean age was 81 years, and 54% of the patients were women. Most were white
(67%) or black (26.5%). Comorbidities before amputation included diabetes
mellitus (70.7%), coronary heart disease (57.1%), chronic kidney disease (53.6%),
and/or congestive heart failure (52.1%). Mortality within 30 days of hospital
discharge was 9.0%, and hospital readmission was 27.7%. Stroke, end-stage renal
disease, and poor baseline cognitive function were associated with the poorest
functional outcome after amputation. Compared with residents who received TM
amputation, those who had BK or AK amputation recovered more slowly and failed to
return to baseline function by 6 months. BK was found to have a superior
functional trajectory compared with AK.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly nursing home residents undergoing BK or AK amputation failed
to return to their functional baseline within 6 months. Among frail elderly
nursing home residents, higher amputation level, stroke, end-stage renal disease,
poor baseline cognitive scores, and female sex were associated with inferior
functional status after amputation. These factors should be strongly assessed to 
maintain activities of daily living and quality of life in the nursing home
population.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical
function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness
and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a
heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of
this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general
population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science,
CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD
and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text
review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. 
From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in
patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with
increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. 
In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher 
risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished
physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may 
lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to
understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with
clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated
risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly
associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and
frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established.
METHODS: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test
of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of
frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting
for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for
the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty
status.
RESULTS: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49
(36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of
participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for 
eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61
points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all
comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p
= 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated with worse frailty
status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).
CONCLUSIONS: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and
frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD
patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted
interventions.

Frailty is a physiologic state of increased vulnerability to stressors that
results from decreased physiologic reserves or dysregulation of multiple
physiologic systems. The construct of frailty has been operationalized as a
composite of poor physical function, exhaustion, low physical activity, and
weight loss. Several studies have now examined the prevalence of frailty among
chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and have 
found frailty to be more common among individuals with CKD than among those
without. Furthermore, frailty is associated with adverse outcomes among incident 
dialysis patients, including higher risk of hospitalization and death. Recent
evidence shows that frail patients are started on dialysis earlier (at a higher
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) on average than nonfrail patients,
but it remains unclear whether these patients' frailty is a result of uremia or
is independent of CKD. The survival disadvantage that has been associated with
early initiation of dialysis in observational studies could be mediated in part
through confounding on the basis of unmeasured frailty. However, available data
do not suggest improvement in frailty upon initiation of dialysis; rather, the
trajectory appears to be toward higher levels of dependence in activities of
daily living (ADLs) after dialysis initiation. Overall, there are no data to
suggest that frail patients derive any benefit from early initiation of dialysis 
either in the form of improved survival or functional status.

AIMS: The Cockcroft-Gault (CG), the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) 
and the CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) formulae are 
often used to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The objective was to
determine the best method for estimating GFR in older adults.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the geriatric wards of two
hospitals in The Netherlands. Patients aged 70 years or above with an estimated
(e)GFR below 60 ml min⁻¹  1.73 m⁻² were included. The CG, CG calculated with
ideal bodyweight (IBW), MDRD and CKD-EPI formulae were compared with a criterion 
standard, sinistrin clearance. Renal function was classified into five stages
according to the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative
chronic kidney disease classification, as follows (in ml min⁻¹  1.73 m)⁻²:
stage 1, eGFR ≥ 90; stage 2, eGFR of 60-89; stage 3, eGFR of 30-59; stage 4, eGFR
of 15-29; and stage 5, eGFR < 15.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients, 50% male, with a mean age of 82 years (range 71-87
years) and mean body mass index 26 kg m⁻² (range 18-36 kg m⁻²), were included. On
average, all formulae slightly overestimated GFR, as follows (in ml min⁻¹  1.73
m⁻²: CG +0.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) -28 to +28]; CG with IBW +0.03 (95%
CI -20 to +20); MDRD +9 (95% CI -16 to +34); and CKD-EPI +5 (95% CI -20 to +29). 
They classified kidney disease correctly in 68.8% (CG), 75% (CG with IBW), 43.8% 
(MDRD) and 68.8% (CKD-EPI) of the participants, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The CG, CG with IBW, MDRD and CKD-EPI formulae estimate the mean GFR
of a population rather well. In individual cases, all formulae may misclassify
kidney disease by one stage.

Although sarcopenia is thought to underlie the manifestations of frailty,
association of frailty with measures of body composition is
underinvestigated.METHODS: Eighty hemodialysis patients were included in the
study. Performance-based frailty (PbF) used gait speed over 20 feet and 5
sit-to-stand (1 point each for lowest quintile) for the physical components of
the frailty phenotype plus exhaustion (Short Form-36 [SF-36] vitality score <55) 
and physical activity (lowest quintile of weekly kcal energy expenditure on
leisure activity on the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly questionnaire; 1 
point). Function-based frailty (FbF) defined by questionnaire measures of
physical functioning (SF-36 Physical Function score <75; 1 point), exhaustion,
and physical activity as for PbF. A score of 2 or greater was defined as frail.
Outcomes related to muscle size included muscle area of the contractile tissue of
the anterior tibialis and quadriceps muscles using magnetic resonance imaging,
phase angle using bioimpedance analysis, lean body mass using dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry, and body mass index (BMI). Linear regression was used to analyze 
associations between frailty and muscle size, with and without sex and age
covariates.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of individuals met PbF criteria, 63% met FbF
criteria, and 55% met both. In univariate analysis, PbF and FbF were associated
with smaller muscle area of the quadriceps, smaller phase angle, and higher BMI. 
Associations remained significant for the quadriceps after adjustment for age and
sex. The magnitude of association of PbF with quadriceps muscle area was greater 
than 10 years of age (-30.3 cm(2)P = .02 vs. -6.6 cm(2)P < .0001) in multivariate
analysis. There was no significant association between either measure of frailty 
and other measures of body composition after adjustment for age and sex.
CONCLUSION: Frailty was associated with measurements related to muscle size in a 
population of individuals with chronic kidney disease, a known contributor to
muscle wasting.

CKD is associated with impairments in health status, physical function, and
frailty. The aim of the current prospective cohort study was to determine whether
CKD predicted new LTCI need certification among community-dwelling older Japanese
adults. This was a prospective cohort study. We analyzed the cohort data from a
prospective study, The Japan Multicenter Aging Cohort for Care Prevention
(J-MACC). We followed 8063 elderly adults for 2 years, and we analyzed the
relationship between CKD and LTCI need. The outcome studied was new certification
for LTCI service need during a 2-year period. We measured serum creatinine (the
estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR), serum albumin, frailty checklist
scores, and body mass index. During the 2-year follow-up, 536 subjects (6.6%)
were newly certified as needing LTCI services. We stratified the cohort according
to eGFR quartile and performed multivariate analyses using an eGFR value of
71.4-83.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) as a reference. We found that subjects with eGFR
values <60.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) had a significantly elevated risk of LTCI service
need (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.44 [95% CI 1.12-1.86]). Our results indicate that 
CKD is independently associated with new LTCI service need certification and is
an important marker of frailty in older adults.

Anemia is an important healthcare concern among the elderly. In these patients,
the anemia is often mild, with a hemoglobin level >10 g/dL. It is usually well
tolerated, but might be responsible for several proteiform and/or atypical
presenting complaints. In the elderly, anemia is usually of multifactorial
origin, including chronic inflammation, chronic kidney disease, nutrient
deficiencies and iron deficiency (approximately two-thirds of all cases). The
remaining cases are unexplained (unknown etiology). In the elderly, the classic
diagnosis of anemia, which is based on the mean corpuscular volume associated
with a low hemoglobin level, might not be accurate. A predefined standardized
diagnostic procedure should be followed. In the common case of frail elderly
patients, all investigations should be carefully considered and invasive
examinations undertaken where justified (risk-benefit balance). Nevertheless,
most cases of anemia require further investigation and the underlying cause
should be identified and treated whenever possible.

Elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or who are on dialysis
should be able to live as fully and comfortably as possible. Geriatric patients
are most interested in outcomes that will optimize mental and physical function
and limit suffering and pain. Nephrologists must help them answer the question:
"How will my kidney problem affect the way I live now and in the future?" This
means management must move beyond glomerular filtration rate-related targets and 
incorporate geriatric principles that focus on assessment of function,
comorbidities, geriatric syndromes, and quality of life issues. Therapeutic
decisions should be individualized and directed by patient goals of care, which
must be explored and documented. Accomplishing this requires inclusion of the
patient's family-support system in the shared decision-making process. There is
no substitute for spending time listening to and understanding the patient and
family agenda, providing timely medical and prognostic updates; discussing
realistic scenarios to balance expectations; and planting the seeds of change as 
the quantity and quality of medical events, geriatric syndromes, and
comorbidities accumulate. Synergy of the interdisciplinary renal team with
geriatric and palliative medicine specialists provides the expertise to achieve
these goals. This falls into the domain of geriatric renal palliative or
supportive care (1) and is the subject of this practical review.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 
(KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation,
Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of
kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease
to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of
older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress
to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific
cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older
adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have
shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated 
with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis)
and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally
thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes 
include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research
studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD 
and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the
longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the
oldest old with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced
functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing
the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the
CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or
evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based
cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study.
OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association
with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more
of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss,
exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum
cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to
relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was
51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much
older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components
were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes,
eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a
2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of
frailty compared with GFR(cys) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during 
a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was
associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or 
dialysis therapy.
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal
relationships between CKD and frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is
associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.

During the last century the considerable increase in life expectancy has led to
important demographic changes and, consequently, to new clinical scenarios.
Nowadays, chronic conditions, comorbidities and socio-economic factors constitute
a relevant health management issue. In particular, the definition of frail
elderly individuals has proven to have a strong role in the identification of
high-risk patients, their clinical management and prognosis. Reorganization of
the medical system has been associated with the development of new instruments
for clinical assessment, focused on clinical and socio-economic issues, resulting
in a multidimensional geriatric assessment. A large number of approaches have
been validated in different clinical settings and populations, until the
development of multidimensional instruments demonstrated to have a crucial role
in the identification of frail individuals and in their clinical management.
Interestingly, some of these, such as the Multidimensional Prognostic Index
(MPI), proved to play a relevant role in mortality risk stratification even in
particular clinical settings such as chronic kidney disease.

OBJECTIVE: Many older adults have decreased kidney function. Practitioners should
be informed that no single clinical assessment method is validated in predicting 
their kidney function.
DATA SOURCES: Primary literature identified through MEDLINE/PubMed (1950-2010)
and EMBASE (1980-2010) databases. The search was limited to English language,
human subjects, and individuals 65 years of age and older.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Research, review articles, and additional
publications related to geriatric, elderly, kidney function assessment, and
cystatin C.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Screening and diagnosing chronic kidney disease are a challenge
in older adults partially because of muscle loss and frailty. The various tools
used to estimate creatinine clearance (Clcr) are not validated and may lead to
under- or overdiagnosis of kidney function. The clinician must be cautious when
using and interpreting results from these values.
RESULTS: Estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with either the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) or Cockcroft-Gault (Clcr) formulae
yielded better predictions of kidney function when compared with creatinine
alone, or to measured Clcr. These estimation methods should be used in clinical
practice to provide a better estimation of kidney function in older adults until 
a more valid assessment tool becomes available.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no proven valid method for eGFR in older adults; however,
the CG and MDRD equations are routinely applied in clinical practice. Kidney
function assessment in older adults remains a challenge, and practitioners should
know their limitations.

BACKGROUND: Hospital use near the end of life is often undesirable to patients,
represents considerable Medicare cost, and varies widely across regions.
OBJECTIVE: To concurrently examine regional and patient factors, including
disability and functional decline, associated with end-of-life hospital use.
DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: We sampled decedents aged 65 and older (n = 2,493) from the 
Health and Retirement Study (2000-2006), and linked data from individual Medicare
claims and the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. Two-part regression models
estimated the relationship between total hospital days in the last 6 months and
patient characteristics including physical function, while adjusting for regional
resources and hospital care intensity (HCI).
KEY RESULTS: Median hospital days was 7 (range = 0-183). 53% of respondents had
functional decline. Compared with decedents without functional decline, those
with severe disability or decline had more regression-adjusted hospital days
(range 3.47-9.05, depending on category). Dementia was associated with fewer days
(-3.02); while chronic kidney disease (2.37), diabetes (2.40), stroke or
transient ischemic attack (2.11), and congestive heart failure (1.74) were
associated with more days. African Americans and Hispanics had more days (5.91
and 4.61, respectively). Those with family nearby had 1.62 fewer days and hospice
enrollees had 1.88 fewer days. Additional hospital days were associated with
urban residence (1.74) and residence in a region with more specialists (1.97) and
higher HCI (2.27).
CONCLUSIONS: Functional decline is significantly associated with end-of-life
hospital use among older adults. To improve care and reduce costs, health care
programs and policies should address specific needs of patients with functional
decline and disability.

Non-dialysis care (NDC) is the provision of all aspects of renal care except for 
the dialysis process. While the nomenclature may vary, with terms such as
'conservative care', 'maximal conservative management' or 'non-dialytic
treatment' having been associated with NDC, the clinical principle is to provide 
comprehensive care to patients who opt to forgo dialysis despite increasing
uraemic symptoms. NDC therapies focus on pain relief, the use of
erythropoietin-stimulating agents, anti-pruritics and anti-nausea therapies, with
lower emphasis on strategies used to modulate the rate of renal progression.
Patient selection remains the most challenging aspect of developing an NDC
program, with selection often being based on physician instinct, family
principles and population-based prognostic risk measures. Outcomes are fair with 
a significant proportion of NDC patients experiencing lower hospitalization days 
and higher rates of death at home (or in a preferred environment) rather than in 
acute-care hospitals.

Frailty is associated with a pro-inflammatory state, which has been characterized
by elevated levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers, but has not been related 
to the number of co-existing chronic diseases associated with inflammation. We
sought to determine the extent to which a higher number of inflammatory-related
diseases is associated with frailty and to identify the most common disease
patterns associated with being frail in older adults. We performed binomial
regression analyses to assess whether a higher count of inflammatory-related
diseases increases the probability of frailty using data from the WHAS I and II, 
companion cohorts composed of 70-79-year-old community-dwelling older women in
Baltimore, Maryland (n=620). An increase of one inflammatory-related disease was 
associated log-linearly with frailty (Prevalence Ratio (PR)=2.28, 95% Confidence 
Interval (CI)=1.81-2.87). After adjusting for age, race, education, and smoking
status, the probability of frailty remained significant (PR=1.97,
95%CI=1.52-2.55). In the frail population, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
depressive symptoms (Prevalence=22.9%, 95%CI=14.2-34.8%); CVD and depressive
symptoms (21.7%, 95%CI=13.2-33.5%); CKD and anemia (18.7%, 95%CI=11.1-29.7%);
cardiovascular disease (CVD), CKD, and pulmonary disease (10.7%,
95%CI=5.2-21.0%); CKD, anemia, and depressive symptoms (8.7%, 95%CI=3.9-18.2%);
and CVD, anemia, pulmonary disease, and depressive symptoms (5.0%,
95%CI=1.6-14.4%) were among the most frequent disease combinations. Their
prevalence percentages were significantly higher in the frail versus non-frail
women. A higher inflammatory-related disease count, perhaps reflecting a greater 
pro-inflammatory burden, increases the likelihood of frailty. Shared mechanisms
among specific disease combinations may further contribute to this risk.

An aging renal population-is dialysis always the answer?

Noble H(1).

As people age and live for longer they are more likely to develop comorbid
conditions including chronic kidney disease (CKD). This paper discusses the
treatment options for stage 5 CKD including haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis,
transplantation or conservative management, also known as supportive care, for
those who decide not to undertake dialysis. It also highlights the complexity of 
offering a treatment such as dialysis, viewed as a requirement to prolong life,
without which people will die, which is unable to restore the kidneys to normal
function, only substitute for. Dialysis is also an arduous therapy known to
shorten life. In the past refusal of dialysis was viewed as akin to suicide and
it is not until more recently that the needs and experiences of those who decide 
not to embark on dialysis have started to be recognized. Clearly dialysis is not 
suitable for all, particularly those who are frail with multiple comorbidities
and so supportive and palliative care may be a more suitable option for some.

Patients with ESRD have extensive and unique end-of-life care considerations and 
needs. Despite substantial advancements in renal palliative care over the past
decade, much research is still required. Identifying CKD patients whose illness
trajectory has shifted and would likely benefit from a palliative approach to
care should be a priority of all nephrology programs. Further research on symptom
management, the effectiveness of ACP, the life expectancy of conservatively
managed and incident dialysis patients, anticipated changes in functional status 
and HRQL with the initiation of dialysis (especially among the frail elderly),
and the best way to deliver renal palliative care is required to maximize the
integration and effectiveness of renal palliative care services.

BACKGROUND: detecting chronic kidney disease (CKD) may have important
implications for the management of older and frail people. We aimed at
investigating whether clinical setting (nursing home: NH versus hospital: H)
affects the agreement between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values estimated
by Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), Cockcroft-Gault
(CG) and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equations.
DESIGN: observational study.
SETTING: comparison between NH residents and H patients.
SUBJECTS: we used data from 177 NH residents, and 439 H patients.
METHODS: the agreement between estimating equations and the odds of a discrepancy
>25% between formulas in relation to setting (NH versus H) were investigated.
RESULTS: the agreement between MDRD and CKD-EPI formulas was good either in NH (k
= 0.82) or H (k = 0.87) patients, while corresponding figures for CG indicate
only a fair agreement with CKD-EPI (k = 0.50 for both populations). Setting (NH
versus H) was associated with discordance between MDRD and CKD-EPI (OR = 3.97;
95% CI = 1.75-9.01), but not between CG and EPI (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.87-1.81).
CONCLUSIONS: in NH residents, MDRD and CKD-EPI formulas yield highly concordant
GFR values, but CG behaves differently in up to one-third of patients. Such
findings have important implications in dosing drugs cleared by the kidney.
Setting should be taken into consideration in studies for validation of GFR
equations.

BACKGROUND: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is directly associated with
survival. However, the prognostic significance of GFR might be different
according to the formula used to estimate it. We aimed at comparing the
association between GFR estimated using three different formulas and 1-year
survival in elderly patients discharged from acute care hospitals.
METHODS: Our series consisted of 439 patients aged 65 and older admitted to 11
acute care medical wards enrolled in a multicentre prospective observational
study. GFR was estimated by body surface area-adjusted Cockcroft-Gault (CG-BSA), 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulas. The relative risk of mortality in 
patients with estimated GFR = 30-59.9 or < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) compared to people
with estimated GFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was calculated using Cox regression
analysis.
RESULTS: Participants with reduced GFR showed an increased mortality, regardless 
of the equation used, and the highest one was associated with CG-BSA-estimated
GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). After adjusting for potential confounders,
CKD-EPI-estimated GFR remained significantly associated with the outcome [30-59.9
mL/min/1.73 m(2), hazard ratio (HR) = 1.70, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) =
1.02-2.98; < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.20-5.66], while the
strength of the association was clearly reduced for MDRD (30-59.9 mL/min/1.73
m(2), HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 0.83-2.38; < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 2.07, 95% CI =
1.01-4.30) and CG-BSA (30-59.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 1.79, 95% CI = 0.67-4.53; <
30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), HR = 2.68, 95% CI = 0.92-7.55).
CONCLUSION: GFR adds to the list of prognostic indicators in elderly and frail
people, and CKD-EPI-derived GFR, which outperforms to some extent MDRD and
CG-BSA-derived GFR in a multivariable predictive model, seems worthy of testing
in wider populations.

Thyroid hormone abnormalities and frailty in elderly patients with chronic kidney
disease: a hypothesis.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults,
affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are
encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap
with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder 
may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded
in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed 
to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is
being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization
and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low
testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of
whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly
CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In
this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone
abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with
CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors 
predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and
treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
importance.

OBJECTIVE: To update the evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and
treatment of hypertension in adults for 2010.
OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES: For lifestyle and pharmacological interventions, randomized
trials and systematic reviews of trials were preferentially reviewed. Changes in 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes of interest.
However, for lifestyle interventions, blood pressure lowering was accepted as a
primary outcome given the general lack of long-term morbidity and mortality data 
in this field. Progressive renal impairment was also accepted as a clinically
relevant primary outcome among patients with chronic kidney disease.
EVIDENCE: A Cochrane Collaboration librarian conducted an independent MEDLINE
search from 2008 to August 2009 to update the 2009 recommendations. To identify
additional studies, reference lists were reviewed and experts were contacted. All
relevant articles were reviewed and appraised independently by both content and
methodological experts using prespecified levels of evidence.
RECOMMENDATIONS: For lifestyle modifications to prevent and treat hypertension,
restrict dietary sodium to 1500 mg (65 mmol) per day in adults 50 years of age or
younger, to 1300 mg (57 mmol) per day in adults 51 to 70 years of age, and to
1200 mg (52 mmol) per day in adults older than 70 years of age; perform 30 min to
60 min of moderate aerobic exercise four to seven days per week; maintain a
healthy body weight (body mass index 18.5 kg/m(2) to 24.9 kg/m(2)) and waist
circumference (less than 102 cm for men and less than 88 cm for women); limit
alcohol consumption to no more than 14 standard drinks per week for men or nine
standard drinks per week for women; follow a diet that emphasizes fruits,
vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fibre, whole grains
and protein from plant sources, and that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol;
and consider stress management in selected individuals with hypertension. For the
pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets
should be predicated on the patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ
damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to less than
140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with
diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than
one agent to achieve these target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy
should be considered in all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be
exercised in elderly patients who are frail). For adults without compelling
indications for other agents, considerations for initial therapy should include
thiazide diuretics, angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in patients 
who are not black), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of
age). A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered as initial
treatment of hypertension if systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above target or
if diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above target. The combination of ACE
inhibitors and ARBs should not be used, unless compelling indications are present
to suggest consideration of dual therapy. Agents appropriate for first-line
therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include thiazide diuretics,
long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with coronary artery
disease, ACE inhibitors, ARBs or betablockers are recommended as first-line
therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic
combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney
disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are
recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, 
in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are
appropriate first-line therapies. In selected high-risk patients in whom
combination therapy is being considered, an ACE inhibitor plus a long-acting
dihydropyridine CCB is preferable to an ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic.
All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the
thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian lipid treatment
guidelines. Selected patients with hypertension who do not achieve thresholds for
statin therapy, but who are otherwise at high risk for cardiovascular events,
should nonetheless receive statin therapy. Once blood pressure is controlled,
low-dose acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered.
VALIDATION: All recommendations were graded according to the strength of the
evidence and voted on by the 63 members of the Canadian Hypertension Education
Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force. All recommendations reported
here achieved at least 80% consensus. These guidelines will continue to be
updated annually.
SPONSORS: The Canadian Hypertension Education Program process is sponsored by the
Canadian Hypertension Society, Blood Pressure Canada, the Public Health Agency of
Canada, the College of Family Physicians of Canada, the Canadian Pharmacists
Association, the Canadian Council of Cardiovascular Nurses, and the Heart and
Stroke Foundation of Canada.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the acute and late outcomes
of a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) program including both the
transfemoral (TF) and transapical (TA) approaches; and 2) to determine the
results of TAVI in patients deemed inoperable because of either porcelain aorta
or frailty.
BACKGROUND: Very few data exist on the results of a comprehensive TAVI program
including both TA and TF approaches for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis
in patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with the Edwards valve (Edwards 
Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, California) between January 2005 and June 2009 in 6
Canadian centers were included.
RESULTS: A total of 345 procedures (TF: 168, TA: 177) were performed in 339
patients. The predicted surgical mortality (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk
score) was 9.8 +/- 6.4%. The procedural success rate was 93.3%, and 30-day
mortality was 10.4% (TF: 9.5%, TA: 11.3%). After a median follow-up of 8 months
(25th to 75th interquartile range: 3 to 14 months) the mortality rate was 22.1%. 
The predictors of cumulative late mortality were peri-procedural sepsis (hazard
ratio [HR]: 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48 to 8.28) or need for
hemodynamic support (HR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.11 to 6), pulmonary hypertension (PH)
(HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR: 2.30, 95% CI:
1.38 to 3.84), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 1.75, 95%
CI: 1.09 to 2.83). Patients with either porcelain aorta (18%) or frailty (25%)
exhibited acute outcomes similar to the rest of the study population, and
porcelain aorta patients tended to have a better survival rate at 1-year
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: A TAVI program including both TF and TA approaches was associated
with comparable mortality as predicted by surgical risk calculators for the
treatment of patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk, including
porcelain aorta and frail patients. Baseline (PH, COPD, CKD) and peri-procedural 
(hemodynamic support, sepsis) factors but not the approach determined worse
outcomes.

The incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing
worldwide, especially in the elderly. Recently, functional impairment and frailty
have been recognized as factors affecting the quality of life, and outcomes in
elderly patients with CKD and therapeutic interventions to improve function and
reduce frailty are therefore being considered. Growth hormone (GH) levels
decrease with age and GH actions are impaired in CKD patients. GH stimulates
protein synthesis, bone, and glucose metabolism, and affects body composition by 
reducing body fat and increasing lean body mass. An increase in lean body mass
may reduce frailty and thus avoid functional impairment. Thus, providing GH to
elderly CKD patients could potentially improve outcomes and quality of life by
lowering the risk of frailty and associated functional impairment. There are few 
studies assessing the long-term effects of GH administration on symptoms of
frailty in elderly patients with CKD. In this review we will try to shed some
light on the trials assessing the administration of GH to elderly subjects and to
patients with CKD and focus on the possible role GH administration may play to
improve frailty and quality of life in those patients.

Older adults (aged >or=65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD
population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging.
Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the
frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among
vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical 
performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death.
Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits 
seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a
highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the
trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed 
to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to
identify opportunities to intervene.

Chronic kidney disease, transplantation practices and transplantation law in
Pakistan: opportunity for a global meditation.

The majority of countries have enacted edicts to regulate organ transplantation
due to mounting recognition of its intricacies and increasing level of global
disquiet. Frail national economy and status of health care infrastructure
restricts access of the local population to both dialysis and transplantation in 
Pakistan. There is a surge in kidney transplantation activities, however. I have 
reported the enormity of organ crime in Pakistan. The number of commercial renal 
transplants range from 3000 to 4500. Foreign nationals share the marketplace.
There are current attempts from the government to stop organ trade by strictly
enforcing a recently sanctioned law on organ transplantation. Scarcity of
comprehensive reliable data has hampered plausible assessments and indispensable 
modifications to facilitate designs for the future health care. Alternatives to
organ transplantation will augment the choice of treatment modalities for a
proliferating end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population. The whole array of
existing therapeutic modalities for ESRD has to be utilized. Promoting a fresh
culture of organ donation by strengthening of the family institution may be
another objective.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney
disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated
criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to 
determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were
associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the
association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly
increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for
the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds 
of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation,
vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and
chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney
disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.
Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection
remain elusive.

OBJECTIVE: To update the evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and
management of hypertension in adults for 2009.
OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES: For lifestyle and pharmacological interventions, evidence
from randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews of trials was
preferentially reviewed. Changes in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were
the primary outcomes of interest. However, for lifestyle interventions, blood
pressure lowering was accepted as a primary outcome given the lack of long-term
morbidity and mortality data in this field. Progression of kidney dysfunction was
also accepted as a clinically relevant primary outcome among patients with
chronic kidney disease.
EVIDENCE: A Cochrane collaboration librarian conducted an independent MEDLINE
search from 2007 to August 2008 to update the 2008 recommendations. To identify
additional published studies, reference lists were reviewed and experts were
contacted. All relevant articles were reviewed and appraised independently by
both content and methodological experts using prespecified levels of evidence.
RECOMMENDATIONS: For lifestyle modifications to prevent and treat hypertension,
restrict dietary sodium to less than 2300 mg (100 mmol)/day (and 1500 mg to 2300 
mg [65 mmol to 100 mmol]/day in hypertensive patients); perform 30 min to 60 min 
of aerobic exercise four to seven days per week; maintain a healthy body weight
(body mass index 18.5 kg/m(2) to 24.9 kg/m(2)) and waist circumference (smaller
than 102 cm for men and smaller than 88 cm for women); limit alcohol consumption 
to no more than 14 units per week in men or nine units per week in women; follow 
a diet that is reduced in saturated fat and cholesterol, and that emphasizes
fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fibre, whole
grains and protein from plant sources; and consider stress management in selected
individuals with hypertension. For the pharmacological management of
hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on by the
patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid
conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to lower than 140/90 mmHg in all
patients, and to lower than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or
chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve
these target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered in
all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in elderly
patients who are frail). For adults without compelling indications for other
agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics. Other agents
appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic and/or systolic hypertension
include angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in patients who are not 
black), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor
antagonists (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A
combination of two first-line agents may also be considered as the initial
treatment of hypertension if the systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above the
target or if the diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above the target. The
combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used. Other agents
appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include
long- acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with angina, recent
myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are
recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an
ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric
nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE 
inhibitors) are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE
inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or
dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. All hypertensive
patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and
agents outlined in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement
(recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention
of cardiovascular disease). Selected high-risk patients with hypertension who do 
not achieve thresholds for statin therapy according to the position paper should 
nonetheless receive statin therapy. Once blood pressure is controlled,
acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered.
VALIDATION: All recommendations were graded according to strength of the evidence
and voted on by the 57 members of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program
Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force. All recommendations reported here
achieved at least 95% consensus. These guidelines will continue to be updated
annually.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the elderly -- a geriatrician's perspective.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming increasingly prevalent among many
different populations all over the world, including the US and Europe. Its
multitude of complications with devastating outcomes leads to a significantly
higher risk for cardio-vascular and all-cause mortality in an individual.
However, it is clear now that early detection of CKD might not only delay some of
the complications but also prevent them. Therefore, various important public
health organizations all over the world have turned their focus and attention to 
CKD and its risk factors, early detection and early intervention. Nevertheless,
the general goals in preventing the increase in CKD and its complications are far
from being completely achieved. Why is this so? What is the magnitude and
complexity of the problem? How is it affecting the population - are there
differences in its affection by age, gender or frail elderly versus the robust?
Are we modifying the risk factors appropriately and aggressively? Are there
subtle differences in managing the risk factors in those on dialysis versus the
non-dialysis CKD patients? Is it important to treat anaemia of CKD aggressively, 
will it make a difference in the disease progression, its complications or to
quality of life? What do these unfortunate individuals commonly succumb to? What 
do we advise patients who refuse dialysis or those who desire dialysis or
transplant? Are there useful non-dialytic treatment recommendations for those who
refuse dialysis? What is the role of the physicians caring for the elderly with
CKD? When should the primary care givers refer a CKD patient to a nephrologist?
The key to eventually controlling incident and prevalent CKD and improve quality 
of life of affected individuals, lies in not only knowing these and many other
vital aspects, but also in applying such knowledge compulsively in day-to-day
practice by each and every one us. As CKD is increasingly a disease of the
elderly with men being affected more, this review details fairly comprehensively 
the vital aspects of CKD, especially from a primary care geriatrician's practical
standpoint.

Assisted peritoneal dialysis.

Elderly patients are the largest and fastest growing group of patients with
chronic kidney disease maintained on dialysis in the world. Because of advanced
age and a heavy burden of comorbidities, the elderly are usually not candidates
for kidney transplantation and are less likely to be offered peritoneal dialysis 
(PD). There is, however, growing evidence that the use of community nurses to
assist with PD and the introduction of programs for assisted peritoneal dialysis 
(aPD) targeting these frail, elderly patients may enable more elderly patients to
have their PD treatment at home. Suitable candidates for aPD are incident
end-stage kidney disease patients preferring PD but unable to perform their own
treatment because of comorbidities, physical disabilities, or psychosocial
problems; prevalent, previous autonomous PD patients who have lost their
independence because of advanced age or an increased burden of comorbidities; or 
prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients switched from HD to aPD because of their own
preference, failure of vascular access for HD, or an inability to tolerate HD. We
believe that aPD in the future will prove to be a safe and feasible complementary
alternative to in-center HD for the growing group of frail, elderly patients with
end-stage kidney disease.

Therapeutic failure-related hospitalisations in the frail elderly.

Geriatrics Institute, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, USA.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although therapeutic failure may be a common cause of
drug-related morbidity in older adults, few studies have focused on this problem.
The study objective was to determine the frequency and types of, and the factors 
associated with, therapeutic failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly
patients, using a new instrument named the Therapeutic Failure Questionnaire
(TFQ).
METHODS: The sample included 106 frail, hospitalised elderly patients enrolled in
a 1-year-long health service intervention trial at 11 Veterans Affairs Medical
Centres. The TFQ was developed by a team of clinical geriatricians and tested for
reliability by two clinical pharmacists and a geriatrician on a sample of 32
patients. To establish validity, a geriatrician retrospectively reviewed the
computerised medication records and clinical charts for these patients and
applied the TFQ to determine probable therapeutic failures at the time of
hospital admission.
RESULTS: Inter- and intra-rater reliability for the TFQ were very good (kappa =
0.82 for both). Overall, 11% of patients had one or more probable therapeutic
failures (TFQ scores between 4 and 7) leading to hospitalisation. Cardiopulmonary
disease was a common 'indicator' of therapeutic failure and was often the result 
of non-adherence. The only factor associated with therapeutic failure occurrence 
was severe chronic kidney disease (crude odds ratio 5.87; 95% CI 1.20, 28.69; p =
0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The TFQ was able to identify several cases of probable therapeutic
failure leading to hospitalisation in frail, elderly patients. Non-adherence to
effective therapies for chronic serious cardiopulmonary disease was a common
cause of therapeutic failure and represents a target for interventions to reduce 
hospitalisation. Further research on the occurrence, risk factors for and types
of therapeutic failure is needed in a larger cohort of older non-veterans.
