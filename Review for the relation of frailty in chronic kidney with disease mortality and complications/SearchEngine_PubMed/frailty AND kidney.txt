BACKGROUND: Frail kidney transplant (KT) recipients have higher risk of adverse
post-KT outcomes. Yet, there is interest in measuring frailty at KT evaluation
and then using this information for post-KT risk stratification. Given long wait 
times for KT, frailty may improve or worsen between evaluation and KT. Patterns, 
predictors, and post-KT adverse outcomes associated with these changes are
unclear.
METHODS: 569 adult KT candidates were enrolled in a cohort study of frailty
(11/2009-09/2017) at evaluation and followed-up at KT. Patterns of frailty
transitions were categorized as: 1) binary state change (frail/nonfrail); 2)
3-category state change (frail/intermediate/nonfrail); and 3) raw score change
(-5 to 5). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models were
used to test whether patterns of frailty transitions were associated with adverse
post-KT outcomes.
RESULTS: Between evaluation and KT, 22.0% became more frail, while 24.4% became
less frail. Black race (RRR=1.98, 95%CI:1.07-3.67) was associated with
frail-to-nonfrail transition; diabetes (RRR=2.56, 95%CI:1.22-5.39) was associated
with remaining stably frail. Candidates who became more frail between 3-category 
states (HR=2.27, 95%CI:1.11-4.65) or frailty scores (HR=2.36, 95%CI:1.12-4.99)
had increased risk of post-KT mortality and had higher odds of length of stay
(LOS) ≥2 weeks (3-category: OR=2.02, 95%CI:1.20-3.40; scores: OR=1.92,
95%CI:1.13-3.25).
CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of KT candidates experienced change in frailty between
evaluation and KT, and those transitions were associated with mortality and
longer LOS. Monitoring changes in frailty from evaluation to admission may
improve post-KT risk stratification.

Background: Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are
mostly elderly patients with substantial comorbidities. Established risk scores
are not validated for TAVR and collectives with elderly patients making
periprocedural risk stratification difficult. Serum albumin is known to be an
indicator for malnutrition and frailty and is simple to measure, independent of
physician's bias. Using serum albumin as a preoperative marker for postoperative 
complications might help estimating morbidity and mortality of these patients.
Methods: A total of 457 patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis
undergoing TAVR at our institution in a period from January 2014 to December 2015
were included in this retrospective study. Baseline characteristics as well as
preoperative laboratory parameters were registered. Postoperative morbidity and
30-day mortality were analyzed as primary end points. Enrolled patients with
preoperative low serum albumin (<3.5 g/dL) were compared with those revealing
normal serum albumin (≥3.5 g/dL).
Results: Among 457 patients, 51 (11%) presented pre-procedural low serum albumin 
and 406 (89%) had normal serum albumin. Patients' mean age was 81±6 years and 50%
of them were male. Postoperative complications such as requirement of blood
transfusions (63% versus 33%, P<0.001), infection (53% versus 24%, P<0.001),
acute kidney injury (41% versus 19%, P=0.001) and 30-day mortality (10% versus
3%, P=0.045) showed significant differences between preoperative low and normal
albumin groups.
Conclusions: Preoperative low serum albumin might be an indicator for higher
morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing TAVR.

Sarcopenia and frailty are recognized as key risk factors for adverse outcomes in
patients on renal replacement therapy or with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease
(CKD). However, there is still debate about their pathogenesis and, thus, about
the best therapeutic approaches, as well as the impact on outcomes of current
approaches based on different exercise programmes. In the past two issues of
Clinical Kidney Journal, several manuscripts address the issue of sarcopenia in
CKD from the point of view of pathogenesis and new therapeutic approaches,
monitoring of results, implementation of exercise programmes and specific
potential benefits of exercise programmes in dialysis and non-dialysis CKD
patients, as assessed by clinical trials.

Diabetes mellitus affects over 20% of people aged > 65 years. With the population
of older people living with diabetes growing, the condition may be only one of a 
number of significant comorbidities that increases the complexity of their care, 
reduces functional status and inhibits their ability to self-care. Coexisting
comorbidities may compete for the attention of the patient and their healthcare
team, and therapies to manage comorbidities may adversely affect a person's
diabetes. The presence of renal or liver disease reduces the types of
antihyperglycemic therapies available for use. As a result, insulin and
sulfonylurea-based therapies may have to be used, but with caution. There may be 
a growing role for sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors in
diabetic renal disease and for glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 therapy in renal and
liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis). Cancer treatments pose considerable
challenges in glucose therapy, especially the use of cyclical chemotherapy or
glucocorticoids, and cyclical antihyperglycemic regimens may be required.
Clinical trials of glucose lowering show reductions in microvascular and, to a
lesser extent, cardiovascular complications of diabetes, but these benefits take 
many years to accrue, and evidence specifically in older people is lacking.
Guidelines recognize that clinicians managing patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus need to be mindful of comorbidity, particularly the risks of
hypoglycemia, and ensure that patient-centered therapeutic management of diabetes
is offered. Targets for glucose control need to be carefully considered in the
context of comorbidity, life expectancy, quality of life, and patient wishes and 
expectations. This review discusses the role of chronic kidney disease, chronic
liver disease, cancer, severe mental illness, ischemic heart disease, and frailty
as comorbidities in the therapeutic management of hyperglycemia in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Treatment of older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is complex because they
represent a heterogeneous group with a broad range of comorbidities, functional
abilities, socioeconomic status, and life expectancy. Older adults with T2D are
at high risk of recurring hypoglycemia, a condition associated with marked
morbidity and mortality, because their counter-regulatory mechanism to
hypoglycemia is attenuated, and recurring hypoglycemic episodes can lead to
hypoglycemia unawareness. In addition, polypharmacy, a result of multiple chronic
comorbidities (including heart disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease), can 
increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia, especially when patients are taking
sulfonylureas or insulin. Often the signs of hypoglycemia are nonspecific
(sweating, dizziness, confusion, visual disturbances) and are mistaken for
neurological symptoms or dementia. Consequences of hypoglycemia include acute and
long-term cognitive changes, cardiac arrhythmia and myocardial infarction,
serious falls, frailty, and death, often resulting in hospitalization, which come
at a high economic cost. The American Diabetes Association has recently added
three new recommendations regarding hypoglycemia in the elderly, highlighting
individualized pharmacotherapy with glucose-lowering agents with a low risk of
hypoglycemia and proven cardiovascular safety, avoidance of overtreatment, and
simplifying treatment regimens while maintaining HbA1c targets. Thus, glycemic
goals can be relaxed in the older population as part of individualized care, and 
physicians must make treatment decisions that best serve their patients'
circumstances. This article highlights the issues faced by older people with T2D,
the risk factors for hypoglycemia in this population, and the challenges faced by
health care providers regarding glycemic management in this patient group.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fluid overload and intradialytic hypotension are
associated with cardiovascular events and mortality in patients on hemodialysis. 
We investigated associations between hemodialysis facility practices related to
fluid volume and intradialytic hypotension and patient outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Data were analyzed from 10,250
patients in 273 facilities across 12 countries, from phase 4 of the Dialysis
Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS; 2009-2012). Cox regression models
(shared frailty) were used to estimate associations between facility practices
reported by medical directors in response to the DOPPS Medical Directors Survey
and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization, and
cardiovascular events, adjusting for country, age, sex, dialysis vintage,
predialysis systolic BP, cardiovascular comorbidities, diabetes, body mass index,
smoking, residual kidney function, dialysis adequacy, and vascular access type.
RESULTS: Of ten facility practices tested (chosen a priori), having a protocol
that specifies how often to assess dry weight in most patients was associated
with lower all-cause (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 99% confidence interval [99% CI], 
0.64 to 0.94) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.72; 99% CI, 0.55 to 0.95).
Routine orthostatic BP measurement to assess dry weight was associated with lower
all-cause hospitalization (HR, 0.86; 99% CI, 0.77 to 0.97) and cardiovascular
events (HR, 0.85; 99% CI, 0.73 to 0.98). Routine use of lower dialysate
temperature to limit or prevent intradialytic hypotension was associated with
lower cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.76; 99% CI, 0.58 to 0.98). Routine use of
an online volume indicator to assess dry weight was associated with higher
all-cause hospitalization (HR, 1.19; 99% CI, 1.02 to 1.38). Routine use of sodium
modeling/profiling to limit or prevent intradialytic hypotension was associated
with higher all-cause mortality (HR, 1.36; 99% CI, 1.14 to 1.63), cardiovascular 
mortality (HR, 1.34; 99% CI, 1.04 to 1.73), and cardiovascular events (HR, 1.21; 
99% CI, 1.03 to 1.43).
CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis facility practices relating to the management of fluid 
volume and intradialytic hypotension are associated with patient outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: People living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral therapy (ART)
experience high rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). These co-morbidities
often accumulate and older adults may suffer from multimorbidity. Multimorbidity 
has been associated with loss of quality of life, polypharmacy, and increased
risk of frailty and mortality. Little is known of the trends or predictors NCD
multimorbidity in PLHIV in low- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: We examined NCD multimorbidity in adult PLHIV initiating ART between
2003 and 2014 using a multi-site, observational cohort in Brazil. NCDs included
cardiovascular artery disease, hyperlipidemia (HLD), diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, cirrhosis, osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, venous thromboembolism and
non-AIDS-defining cancers. Multimorbidity was defined as the incident
accumulation of two or more unique NCDs. We used Poisson regression to examine
trends and Cox proportional hazard models to examine predictors of
multimorbidity.
RESULTS: Of the 6206 adults, 332 (5%) developed multimorbidity during the study
period. Parallel to the ageing of the cohort, the prevalence of multimorbidity
rose from 3% to 11% during the study period. Older age, female sex (adjusted
hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.65)) and low
CD4 nadir (<100 vs. ≥200 cells/mm3 aHR = 1.52 (95% CI: 1.15 to 2.01)) at cohort
entry were significantly associated with increased risk of multimorbidity. Among 
patients with incident multimorbidity, the most common NCDs were HLD and
diabetes; however, osteoporosis was also frequent in women (16 vs. 35% of men and
women with multimorbidity respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Among adult PLHIV in Brazil, NCD multimorbidity increased from 2003 
to 2014. Females and adults with low CD4 nadir were at increased risk in adjusted
analyses. Further studies examining prevention, screening and management of NCDs 
in PLHIV in low- and middle-income countries are needed.

BACKGROUND: Restoration of kidney function after kidney transplant generally
improves cognitive function. It is unclear whether frail recipients, with higher 
susceptibility to surgical stressors, achieve such post-transplant cognitive
improvements or whether they experience subsequent cognitive decline as they age 
with a functioning graft.
METHODS: In this two-center cohort study, we assessed pretransplant frailty
(Fried physical frailty phenotype) and cognitive function (Modified Mini-Mental
State Examination) in adult kidney transplant recipients. To investigate
potential short- and medium-term effects of frailty on post-transplant cognitive 
trajectories, we measured cognitive function up to 4 years post-transplant. Using
an adjusted mixed effects model with a random slope (time) and intercept
(person), we characterized post-transplant cognitive trajectories by
pretransplant frailty, accounting for nonlinear trajectories.
RESULTS: Of 665 recipients (mean age 52.0 years) followed for a median of 1.5
years, 15.0% were frail. After adjustment, pretransplant cognitive scores were
significantly lower among frail patients compared with nonfrail patients (89.0
versus 90.8 points). By 3 months post-transplant, cognitive performance improved 
for both frail (slope =0.22 points per week) and nonfrail (slope =0.14 points per
week) recipients. Between 1 and 4 years post-transplant, improvements plateaued
among nonfrail recipients (slope =0.005 points per week), whereas cognitive
function declined among frail recipients (slope =-0.04 points per week). At 4
years post-transplant, cognitive scores were 5.8 points lower for frail
recipients compared with nonfrail recipients.
CONCLUSIONS: On average, both frail and nonfrail recipients experience short-term
cognitive improvement post-transplant. However, frailty is associated with
medium-term cognitive decline post-transplant. Interventions to prevent cognitive
decline among frail recipients should be identified.

We report a rare case of an inguinal hernia containing part of a native kidney
and present a review of the literature with regard to urological findings in
patients with inguinal hernias. This case involves an elderly man with known
bilateral inguinal hernias with an incidental radiographic finding of a large
right inguinal hernia containing the inferior pole of the right kidney. The
patient was not symptomatic from the hernia and given his overall frailty, no
surgical intervention was offered.

BACKGROUND: There is a lack of detailed population-based data for renal cell
carcinoma (RCC).
OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to examine the contemporary changes in the clinical
picture and treatment of RCC.
METHODS: A total of 1,719 consecutive patients living in the Helsinki
metropolitan area with a solid or cystic renal mass (Bosniak 3-4) ≥10 mm were
identified. Data from medical records was evaluated for clinical characteristics 
and treatments in the periods I (2006-2008), II (2009-2011), III (2012-2014), and
IV (2015-2016).
RESULTS: The proportions of patients with comorbidities (Charlson index ≥2) and
frailty (Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group classification ≥2) increased
significantly during the study period. The percentage of clinical stage I
patients, cystic tumors and use of needle biopsies increased significantly. Use
of observation increased from 9% (I) to 32% (IV; p < 0.001). First-line
oncological treatments within 6 months were given to 47% of 262 patients with
metastases and -cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) was delivered to 54% of those
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The size of renal tumors continued to decrease, while the percentage
of patients with significant comorbidity or frailty increased. Active
surveillance emerged as the initial strategy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors with CN 
remained the primary option in patients with metastatic RCC.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation (KT) candidates often present with multiple
comorbidities. These patients also have a substantial burden of frailty, which is
also associated with increased mortality. However, it is unknown if frailty is
merely a surrogate for comorbidity, itself an independent domain of risk, or if
frailty and comorbidity have differential effects. Better understanding the
interplay between these 2 constructs will improve clinical decision making in KT 
candidates.
OBJECTIVE: To test whether comorbidity is equally associated with waitlist
mortality among frail and nonfrail KT candidates and to test whether measuring
both comorbidity burden and frailty improves mortality risk prediction.
METHODS: We studied 2,086 candidates on the KT waitlist (November 2009 - October 
2017) in a multicenter cohort study, in whom frailty and comorbidity were
measured at evaluation. We quantified the association between Charlson
comorbidity index (CCI) adapted for end-stage renal disease and waitlist
mortality using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model and tested whether
this association differed between frail and nonfrail candidates.
RESULTS: At evaluation, 18.1% of KT candidates were frail and 51% had a high
comorbidity burden (CCI score ≥2). Candidates with a high comorbidity burden were
at 1.38-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.89) increased risk of waitlist mortality. However,
this association differed by frailty status (p for interaction = 0.01): among
nonfrail candidates, a high comorbidity burden was associated with a 1.66-fold
(95% CI 1.17-2.35) increased mortality risk; among frail candidates, here was no 
statistically significant association (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.44-1.29). Adding this
interaction between comorbidity and frailty to a mortality risk estimation model 
significantly improved prediction, increasing the c-statistic from 0.640 to 0.656
(p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Nonfrail candidates with a high comorbidity burden at KT evaluation 
have an increased risk of waitlist mortality. Importantly, comorbidity is less of
a concern in already high-risk patients who are frail.

Advanced age is one of the major determinants of frailty in patients with
cancer-associated thrombosis. However, multiple other factors contribute to
frailty in these patients. The identification of frailty in patients with
cancer-associated thrombosis is critical as it influences the complexity of the
anticoagulant treatment in this population at high risk of venous thromboembolism
and bleeding. Factors that contribute to frailty in patients with
cancer-associated thrombosis include age, type of cancer, comorbidities such as
chronic kidney disease, poly-pharmacotherapy, treatment compliance, cognitive
impairment, anemia, thrombocytopenia, mobility, nutritional status, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group grade, risk of falls, and reduced life expectancy. In 
the absence of specific clinical studies current anticoagulant treatment
guidelines for the management are not fully applicable to frail patients with
cancer. The anticoagulant treatment should therefore benefit from a tailored
approach based on an algorithm that takes into account the specificities of the
malignant disease.

Center-specific survival outcomes of kidney transplant recipients are an
important quality measure, with several challenges. Existing methods based on
restricted mean lifetime tend to focus on short- and medium-term clinical
outcomes and may fail to capture long-term effects associated with quality of
follow-up care. In this report, we propose methods that combine a lognormal
frailty model and piecewise exponential baseline rates to compare the mean
survival time across centers. The proposed methods allow for the consistent
estimation of mean survival time as opposed to restricted mean lifetime and,
within this context, permits more accurate profiling of long-term center-specific
outcomes. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are derived, and
finite-sample properties are examined through simulation. The proposed methods
are then applied to national kidney transplant data. The novelty of the proposed 
techniques arises from several angles. We utilize mean survival, in contrast to
the most previous works that considered the restricted mean. Few previous studies
have used the integrated survival function as a basis for center effects. Few
provider profiling methods use a random effects model to estimate fixed center
effects.

The problems with the P value as the single metric to summarize the results of a 
study are being recognized. It captures a single domain-random error-but it is
relatively uninformative about more critical domains for deciding whether the
results should be applied to clinical care and policy. Alternatives include the
components of the outcomes reported (relevance, magnitude, frailty, and net
benefit) and confidence (risk of bias and directness).

There is interdependence between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ageing whereby 
CKD makes ageing more accelerated and pronounced, whereas ageing accelerates
chronic nephropathy's progression. Frailty status catalyzes this spiral, with
renal and systemic negative consequences, and this condition can currently be
documented by applying already validated clinical scores (frailty phenotype) or
physical test (gate speed). Although, nephroprevention strategies are similar
between young adult and senior CKD patients, standard targets should be adequate 
to very old and frail elderly individuals. For this purpose, an original
algorithm is here proposed to adjust the conventional nephroprevention strategies
to the condition of CKD frail patient (more relaxed targets and tighter control),
as well as to prescribe anti-frailty interventions to slow patient's functional
decline, hospitalization and mortality.

Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is rare and characterized endoscopically by
distal esophageal ulceration, blackening, and necrosis. It typically arises in
patients with multiple comorbidities who have significant systemic disease and
frailty. Specific precipitating events are variable. Evidence suggests a
multifactorial etiology likely involving esophageal ischemia in the setting of
corrosive injury from gastric contents and impaired tissue repair mechanisms. In 
the transplant setting, immunosuppression likely plays a substantial role. We
report a case of AEN in a 70-year-old man following a renal transplant.

BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been presented regarding influence of body
mass index (BMI) on outcomes among patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve
implantation (TAVI).
AIMS: To investigate impact of the BMI on the clinical results after TAVI.
METHODS: A total of 148 consecutive patients were categorized using baseline BMI 
according to World Health Organization criteria. The baseline patient
characteristics, frailty, procedural and clinical outcomes with 30 days and
12-month all-cause mortality were compared between BMI categories. Patients were 
followed-up for a median of 460.0 (182.0-1042.0) days.
RESULTS: Obesity was diagnosed in 37 (25.2%) patients, 73 were overweight
(49.7%), and 37 (25.2%) had normal weight. Lower frailty prevalence as assessed
with 5-meter walking test was confirmed in obese patients as compared to other
groups. A trend towards a lower rate of in-hospital bleeding complications [18
(48.6%) vs. 21 (28.8%) vs. 9 (24.3%); p = 0.06] and less frequent blood
transfusions in overweight and obese was observed [18 (48.6%) vs. 17 [23.3%) vs. 
8 (21.6%); p = 0.016]. The rate of grade 3 acute kidney injury was the lowest in 
the overweight group [4 (10.8%) vs. 1 (1.4%) vs. 3 (8.1%); p = 0.05]. There was
no difference between groups in all-cause mortality at 30 days (p = 0.15).
However, 12-month all-cause mortality was the lowest in obese patients [12
(32.4%) vs. 10 (13.7%) vs. 2 (5.4%); p = 0.004]. Increase in BMI was
independently associated with lower all-cause mortality [HR (95%CI) per 1 kg/m²
increase: 0.91 (0.845-0.98); p = 0.018].
CONCLUSIONS: Increased BMI was independently associated with survival benefit
after TAVI.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a syndrome of impaired physiologic reserve and decreased
resistance to stressors and can often be seen in high-risk patients undergoing
transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Preoperative frailty status is
thought to be related to adverse outcomes after TAVR. We conducted this
systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of preoperative
frailty status on outcomes among patients after TAVR.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant
studies through January 2018. Fourteen articles (n = 7489) meeting the inclusion 
criteria were finally included. Possible effects were calculated using
meta-analysis.
RESULTS: The pooled risk ratios (RRs) of late mortality (>6 months) and acute
kidney injury after TAVR in frail group were 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI)
1.90-4.15, P < .001, I = 84%) and 1.41 (95% CI 1.02-1.94, P = .04, I = 24%),
respectively. Compared with non-frail group, significantly higher incidence of
30-day mortality (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.63-2.54, P < .001, I = 0%) and life
threatening or major bleeding after TAVR (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.20-1.82, P < .001,
I = 14%) was found in frail group. There was no significant association between
frailty and incidence of stroke after TAVR (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.53-1.63, P = .80,
I = 0%).
CONCLUSION: Preoperative frailty status is proved to be significantly associated 
with poor outcomes after TAVR. Our findings may remind doctors in the field of a 
more comprehensive preoperative evaluation for TAVR candidates. More
well-designed and large-sample sized prospective studies are further needed to
figure out the best frailty assessment tool for patients undergoing TAVR.

BACKGROUND: Reliable and valid tools to screen for malnutrition in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) remain elusive. The sarcopenia index (SI) [(serum
creatinine/serum cystatin C) × 100], could be an inexpensive, objective tool to
predict malnutrition. We evaluated the SI as a screening tool for malnutrition in
the ICU and compared it with the modified-NUTRIC score.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a historical cohort study of ICU patients with
stable kidney function admitted to Mayo Clinic ICUs between 2008 and 2015.
Malnutrition was defined by the Subjective Global Assessment. Diagnostic
performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) and multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of the 398 included patients, 181 (45%) had malnutrition, with 34 (9%)
scored as severely malnourished. The SI was significantly lower in malnourished
patients than in well-nourished patients (64 ± 27 vs 72 ± 25; P = 0.002), and
reductions in SI corresponded to increased malnutrition severity (P = 0.001). As 
a screening tool, the SI was an indicator of malnutrition risk (AUC 0.61) and
performed slightly better than the more complex modified-NUTRIC score (AUC =
0.57). SI cutoffs of 101 and 43 had >90% sensitivity and >90% specificity,
respectively, for the prediction of malnutrition. Patients with a low SI (≤43)
had a significantly higher risk of mortality (HR = 2.61, 95% CI 1.06-6.48, P =
0.038).
CONCLUSION: The frequency of malnutrition was high in this critically ill
population, and it was associated with a poor prognosis. The SI could be used to 
assess nutrition risk in ICU patients.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frail patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an
increased hospitalisation and mortality rate. However, many popular frailty
screening methods have not been validated in patients with CKD. This study
evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of several frailty screening methods in
patients with CKD G4-5 and those established on haemodialysis (G5D).
METHODS: Ninety participants with CKD G4-5D were recruited from Nephrology
Outpatient Clinics and 2 Haemodialysis Units between December 2016 and December
2017. Frailty was diagnosed using the Fried Frailty Phenotype. The following
frailty screening tests were evaluated: Clinical Frailty Scale, PRISMA-7, CKD
Frailty Index, CKD FI-LAB, walking speed, hand grip strength and Short Physical
Performance Battery.
RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 69 years (SD ±13). One-third of
participants were dialysis-dependent. Nineteen (21%) patients were categorised as
frail, 42 (47%) as pre-frail and 29 (32%) as robust. Overall, walking speed was
the most discriminative measure (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.93-1.00], sensitivity 0.84
[95% CI 0.62-0.94], specificity 0.96 [95% CI 0.88-0.99]). The Clinical Frailty
Scale had the best performance of the non-physical assessment frailty screening
methods (AUC 0.90 [95% CI 0.84-0.97], sensitivity 0.79 [95% CI 0.57-0.91],
specificity 0.87 [95% CI 0.78-0.93]).
CONCLUSIONS: Walking speed can be used to accurately screen for frailty in CKD
populations. If it is not practical to perform a physical assessment to screen
for frailty, the Clinical Frailty Scale is a useful alternative.

A consensus conference on frailty in kidney, liver, heart, and lung
transplantation sponsored by the American Society of Transplantation (AST) and
endorsed by the American Society of Nephrology (ASN), the American Society of
Transplant Surgeons (ASTS), and the Canadian Society of Transplantation (CST)
took place on February 11, 2018 in Phoenix, Arizona. Input from the transplant
community through scheduled conference calls enabled wide discussion of current
concepts in frailty, exploration of best practices for frailty risk assessment of
transplant candidates and for management after transplant, and development of
ideas for future research. A current understanding of frailty was compiled by
each of the solid organ groups and is presented in this paper. Frailty is a
common entity in patients with end-stage organ disease who are awaiting organ
transplantation, and affects mortality on the waitlist and in the posttransplant 
period. The optimal methods by which frailty should be measured in each organ
group are yet to be determined, but studies are underway. Interventions to
reverse frailty vary among organ groups and appear promising. This conference
achieved its intent to highlight the importance of frailty in organ
transplantation and to plant the seeds for further discussion and research in
this field.

Recurrent events could be stopped by a terminal event, which commonly occurs in
biomedical and clinical studies. In this situation, dependent censoring is
encountered because of potential dependence between these two event processes,
leading to invalid inference if analyzing recurrent events alone. The joint
frailty model is one of the widely used approaches to jointly model these two
processes by sharing the same frailty term. One important assumption is that
recurrent and terminal event processes are conditionally independent given the
subject-level frailty; however, this could be violated when the dependency may
also depend on time-varying covariates across recurrences. Furthermore, marginal 
correlation between two event processes based on traditional frailty modeling has
no closed form solution for estimation with vague interpretation. In order to
fill these gaps, we propose a novel joint frailty-copula approach to model
recurrent events and a terminal event with relaxed assumptions.
Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs Sampler algorithm is used for parameter
estimation. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the
efficiency, robustness, and predictive performance of our proposal. The
simulation results show that compared with the joint frailty model, the bias and 
mean squared error of the proposal is smaller when the conditional independence
assumption is violated. Finally, we apply our method into a real example
extracted from the MarketScan database to study the association between recurrent
strokes and mortality.

Renal allotransplantation clearly offers better survival and quality of life for 
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients than chronic dialysis. The median waiting
time for a deceased donor kidney in a suitable ESRD patient is 3.9 years. The
initial candidates for pig kidney xenotransplantation will be those with ESRD
unlikely to receive an allograft within a reasonable period of time. It is thus
reasonable to ascertain whether clinical trials of xenotransplantation might
likewise offer superior outcomes. Chronic dialysis in patients with ESRD is
associated with poor quality of life, significant morbidity, and relatively high 
mortality, with only 56% surviving 3 years and 42% at 5 years. However, a
significant number of these patients, because of comorbidities, frailty, etc,
would not be considered for renal allotransplantation and likely not for
xenotransplantation. As genetically engineered pig kidneys have satisfactorily
supported life in immunosuppressed nonhuman primates for many months or even more
than a year, consideration in carefully selected patients could be given to pig
kidney xenotransplantation. We suggest that, in order to give a patient the best 
possible outcome, the pig kidney could be transplanted pre-emptively (before
dialysis is initiated). If it fails at any stage, the patient would then begin
chronic dialysis and continue to await an allograft. The present (limited)
evidence is that failure of a pig graft would not be detrimental to a subsequent 
allograft.

CONTEXT: Understanding the prevalence and characteristics of primary care
outpatients being at risk of deteriorating and dying may allow general
practitioners (GPs) to identify them and initiate end-of-life discussions.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of
primary care outpatients being at risk of deteriorating and dying, as determined 
by the Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool (SPICT™).
METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional observational study was conducted at 17
clinics with 22 GPs. We enrolled all patients aged ≥65 years who visited the GPs 
in March 2017. We used the Japanese version of the SPICT to identify patients
being at risk of deteriorating and dying. We assessed the demographic and
clinical characteristics of enrolled patients.
RESULTS: In total, 382 patients with a mean age of 77.4 ± 7.9 years were
investigated. Sixty-six patients (17.3%) had ≥2 positive general indicators or ≥1
positive disease-specific indicator in the SPICT-JP. Patients with
dementia/frailty, neurological disease, cancer, and kidney disease showed a
significantly elevated risk of deteriorating and dying, whereas patients with
other specific disease did not. The patients at risk were significantly older and
less likely to be living with family at home. They also had a higher Charlson
Comorbidity Index score and a lower Palliative Performance Scale score.
CONCLUSION: Among primary care outpatients aged over 65 years, 17.3% were at risk
of deteriorating and dying regardless of their estimated survival time, and many 
outpatients at risk were not receiving optimal multidisciplinary care.

Motor functions are deteriorated by aging. Some conditions may magnify this
deterioration. This study examined whether hemodialysis (HD) process would
negatively impact gait and balance beyond diabetes condition among mid-age adults
(48⁻64 years) and older adults (65+ years). One hundred and ninety-six subjects
(age = 66.2 ± 9.1 years, body-mass-index = 30.1 ± 6.4 kg/m², female = 56%) in 5
groups were recruited: mid-age adults with diabetes undergoing HD (Mid-age HD+, n
= 38) and without HD (Mid-age HD-, n = 40); older adults with diabetes undergoing
HD (Older HD+, n = 36) and without HD (Older HD-, n = 37); and non-diabetic older
adults (Older DM-, n = 45). Gait parameters (stride velocity, stride length, gait
cycle time, and double support) and balance parameters (ankle, hip, and center of
mass sways) were quantified using validated wearable platforms. Groups with
diabetes had overall poorer gait and balance compared to the non-diabetic group
(p < 0.050). Among people with diabetes, HD+ had significantly worsened gait and 
balance when comparing to HD- (Cohen's effect size d = 0.63⁻2.32, p < 0.050).
Between-group difference was more pronounced among older adults with the largest 
effect size observed for stride length (d = 2.32, p < 0.001). Results suggested
that deterioration in normalized gait speed among HD+ was negatively correlated
with age (r = -0.404, p < 0.001), while this correlation was diminished among
HD-. Interestingly, results also suggested that poor gait among Older HD- is
related to poor ankle stability, while no correlation was observed between poor
ankle stability and poor gait among Older HD+. Using objective assessments,
results confirmed that the presence of diabetes can deteriorate gait and balance,
and this deterioration can be magnified by HD process. Among HD- people with
diabetes, poor ankle stability described poor gait. However, among people with
diabetes undergoing HD, age was a dominate factor describing poor gait
irrespective of static balance. Results also suggested feasibility of using
wearable platforms to quantify motor performance during routine dialysis clinic
visit. These objective assessments may assist in identifying early deterioration 
in motor function, which in turn may promote timely intervention.

Early outcomes of cardiac surgery in elderly patients.

Mzoughi K, Zairi I, Daly M, Ziadi J, Kamoun S, Ben Moussa F, Fennira S, Kraiem S.

BACKGROUND: Due to the increase in average life expectancy and the higher
incidence of cardiovascular disease, more elderly patients present for cardiac
surgery nowadays. At the same time, age has been considered a predictor of
morbidity and mortality.
AIM: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of cardiac surgery in elderly patients.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive retrospective study including elderly
patients who underwent cardiac surgery from January 2012 to 31st of December
2016. All patients were hospitalized before and after cardiac surgery in the
cardiology department of Habib Thameur Hospital.
RESULTS: Our study included 55 patients. Average age was 72±6 years old and
sex-ratio was two. Eighty-five percent presented with angina, 18% with dyspnea
and one patient with an aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis. Mean left
ventricular function was 54 ±9 %. Mean EuroSCORE II was 1.91±1.18. Twenty-six
per-cent had an urgent surgery. Mean extracorporeal circulation time was of 77±26
min and mean extubation time was 8±6 h. Eighty-four per cent had a coronary
artery bybass grafting and 16% a valve replacement. Four per cent had a redux and
4% a combined surgery. Stay in surgical department varied between 3 and 10 days
with average of 4.6±1.2 days. Early mortality rate was of 2% and 98% had
complications. Ninety-eight complications occurred after surgery: 35
reintervention for mediastinal bleeding or tamponade, 28 bleedings requiring
transfusions, eight heart rhythm disorders, an atrioventricular conduction block 
requiring ventricular, five atrial fibrillation, two ventricular tachycardias, a 
ventricular fibrillation, eight low cardiac outpout, seven prolonged mechanical
ventilation and eight pneumonias. In univariate analysis, recent myocardial
infarction and chronic kidney disease were predictive of early complications.
CONCLUSION: Our data shows cardiac surgery is feasible in elderly patients with
acceptable risk in terms of mortality and an increased morbidity due to their
frailty. Careful patient selection is needed for the success of cardiac surgery
in elderly patients.

This study investigated geographical variations of access to renal
transplantation using three outcomes (access to the transplant waiting list,
access to renal transplantation after waitlisting and access to renal
transplantation after dialysis start). Associations of patient-related and
regional variables with the studied outcomes were assessed using a Cox shared
frailty model and a Fine and Gray model. At the study endpoint (December 31,
2015), 26.3% of all 18-90-year-old patients who started dialysis in the 22
mainland and four overseas French regions in 2012 (n = 9312) were waitlisted and 
15.1% received a kidney transplant. The geographical disparities of access to
renal transplantation varied according to the studied outcome. Patients from the 
Ile-de-France region had the highest probability of being waitlisted, but were
less likely to receive a kidney transplant. Two regional factors were associated 
with the access to the waiting list and to renal transplantation from dialysis
start: the incidence of preemptive kidney transplantation and of ESRD. The use of
different outcomes to evaluate access to kidney transplantation could help
healthcare policy-makers to select the most appropriate interventions for each
region in order to reduce treatment disparities.

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 2% to 4% of patients with
severe aortic stenosis. It is because these patients have been excluded from
clinical trials, the impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in 
this patient group has not been thoroughly investigated. Between April 2008 and
March 2015, 2,000 patients (dialysis group, n = 56 [2.8%]) were consecutively
enrolled when diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis and eligible to undergo TAVI.
Procedural and longer-term outcomes were analyzed and adjusted for differences in
baseline characteristics. Patients on dialysis had a higher periprocedural
mortality (10.7% vs 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio [adjOR] 5.65, 95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.91 to 16.67; p = 0.002) and a lower Valve Academic Research
Consortium (VARC)-II (VARC) defined device success (adjOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to
0.79; p = 0.012). At 30 days, there was an increased rate of all-cause mortality 
(21.4 vs 4.8%; adjOR 4.90, 95% CI 1.96 to 12.26; p = 0.001), cardiovascular
(adjOR 3.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 9.41; p = 0.007) and noncardiovascular mortality
(adjOR 6.28, 95% CI 1.36 to 9.41; p = 0.019), myocardial infarction (adjOR 9.39, 
95% CI 1.84 to 48.03; p = 0.007), bleeding (adjOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.83;
p = 0.036) as well as the VARC-II defined early safety combined end point (adjOR 
2.97, 95% CI 1.28 to 6.90; p = 0.012) associated with dialysis. Dialysis was
associated with poor survival at one (57.1% vs 84.2%) and 3 years (26.8% vs
66.9%) with or without the consideration of the first 72 hours (p <0.001;
adjusted p <0.001). Although, in the multivariable regression analysis, reduced
ejection fraction, peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary hypertension (PH),
frailty and dialysis were associated with 1-year mortality, only PH (>60 mm Hg)
remained significant in an analysis restricted to the dialysis patients (adjusted
hazard ratio 2.68; 95% CI 1.18 to 5.88; p = 0.018). PH had a sensitivity of
45.8%, a specificity of 81.3%, and a positive predictive value of 64.7%. In
conclusion, dialysis is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who
underwent TAVI. Long-term mortality in dialysis patients appears to be largely
determined by the kidney disease and/or dialysis itself whereas VARC-II defined
complications are largely unaffected. An increased short-term mortality still
calls for (pre-) procedural optimization.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Decision-making in elderly patients considering dialysis is
highly complex. With the increasing number of elderly with end-stage kidney
disease (ESKD), it may be important to assess geriatric impairments in this
population. The aim of the Geriatric assessment in OLder patients starting
Dialysis (GOLD) study was to assess the prevalence of geriatric impairments and
frailty in the elderly ESKD population by means of a geriatric assessment (GA),
which is a comprehensive tool for overall health assessment.
METHODS: This study included 285 patients ≥65 years: 196 patients at the time of 
dialysis initiation and 89 patients who chose maximal conservative management
(MCM). The GA assessed cognition, mood, nutritional status, (instrumental)
activities of daily living (ADL), mobility, comorbidity burden, quality of life
and overall frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 78 years and 36% were women. Of the
incident dialysis patients, 77% started haemodialysis and 23% started peritoneal 
dialysis. Geriatric impairments were highly prevalent in both dialysis and MCM
patients. Most frequently impaired geriatric domains in the dialysis group were
functional performance (ADL 29%, instrumental ADL (iADL) 79%), cognition (67%)
and comorbidity (41%). According to the GA, 77% in the dialysis group and 88% in 
the MCM group had 2 or more geriatric impairments. In the MCM group, functional
impairment (ADL 45%, iADL 85%) was highly prevalent.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric impairments are highly prevalent in the elderly ESKD
population. Since impairments can be missed when not searched for in regular
(pre)dialysis care, the first step of improving nephrologic care is awareness of 
the extensiveness of geriatric impairment.

AIM: Since 1998, the leading cause of chronic hemodialysis in Japan has been
diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes mellitus is known to be a risk factor for frailty,
but it still remains unknown whether diabetic nephropathy is associated with
frailty in chronic dialysis patients. The authors carried out the present study
to reveal the association between frailty and diabetic nephropathy in chronic
hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A total of 355 patients who were on hemodialysis were recruited.
Participants were divided into two groups of either patients who suffered
diabetic nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (DN group, n = 150) or not
(Non-DN group, n = 205). The authors investigated the difference of the
prevalence of frailty between the two groups. Furthermore, the authors examined
the risk factors for frailty.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty in the DN group was significantly higher than 
that in the Non-DN group (28.0% vs 16.5%, P = 0.0161). To evaluate the
association between frailty and its risk factors, we compared frail patients
(n = 71) and non-frail patients (n = 262). After adjusting their
interrelationships by using multivariate logistic regression analysis, diabetic
nephropathy was determined as a significant risk factor for frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors found the close association between frailty and diabetic
nephropathy in chronic hemodialysis patients. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18:

BACKGROUND: Decline of renal function is common in older persons and the
prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising with ageing. CKD affects
different outcomes relevant to older persons, additionally to morbidity and
mortality which makes CKD a relevant health burden in this population. Still,
accurate laboratory measurement of kidney function is under debate, since current
creatinine-based equations have a certain degree of inaccuracy when used in the
older population. The aims of the study are as follows: to assess kidney function
in a cohort of 75+ older persons using existing methodologies for CKD screening; 
to investigate existing and innovative biomarkers of CKD in this cohort, and to
align laboratory and biomarker results with medical and functional data obtained 
from this cohort. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier
NCT02691546, February 25th 2016.
METHODS/DESIGN: An observational, multinational, multicenter, prospective cohort 
study in community dwelling persons aged 75 years and over, visiting the
outpatient clinics of participating institutions. The study will enroll 2450
participants and is carried out in Austria, Germany, Israel, Italy, the
Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Participants will undergo clinical and laboratory 
evaluations at baseline and after 12 and 24 months- follow-up. Clinical
evaluation also includes a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). Local
laboratory will be used for 'basic' parameters (including serum creatinine and
albumin-to-creatinine ratio), whereas biomarker assessment will be conducted
centrally. An intermediate telephone follow-up will be carried out at 6 and
18 months.
DISCUSSION: Combining the use of CGA and the investigation of novel and existing 
independent biomarkers within the SCOPE study will help to provide evidence in
the development of European guidelines and recommendations in the screening and
management of CKD in older people.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered prospectively on the 25th February 
2016 at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT02691546 ).

BACKGROUND: In the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, we examined whether fibroblast 
growth factor-23 (FGF-23), a bone-derived phosphaturic hormone involved in bone
metabolism, is associated with incident frailty. Furthermore, we examined whether
this association differs by HIV serostatus and race.
METHODS: Of 715 men assessed for frailty and selected for FGF-23 measurements
using stored blood samples (2007-2011), 512 men were nonfrail at/before the
baseline visit. Frailty was defined by the presence of ≥3 of the following on 2
consecutive 6-month visits within 1 year: unintentional weight loss ≥10 pounds,
weakness, slowness, low energy, and low physical activity. We determined the
association of FGF-23 levels with incident frailty using proportional hazards
models adjusting for sociodemographics, comorbidities, and kidney function.
RESULTS: Sixty-five percent were HIV-infected; 29% were black. Median baseline
FGF-23 levels were lower in HIV-infected vs. HIV-uninfected men (33.7 vs. 39.9
rU/mL, P = 0.006) but similar by race. During a median follow-up of 6.6 years, 32
men developed frailty; they had higher baseline FGF-23 levels vs. men who
remained nonfrail (45 vs. 36 rU/mL, P = 0.02). FGF-23 (per doubling) was
associated with a 1.63-fold risk of frailty [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19
to 2.23]; results did not differ by HIV serostatus. Conversely, FGF-23 was
associated with a 2.72-fold risk of frailty among blacks (95% CI: 1.51 to 4.91)
but had minimal association among nonblacks (hazard ratio = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.77 to
2.05; p-interaction = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: Among men with or at-risk of HIV infection, higher FGF-23 was
associated with greater risk of frailty, particularly in blacks. The mechanisms
by which FGF-23 may contribute to frailty warrant further study.

Geroprotectors, a class of drugs targeting multiple deficits occurring with age, 
necessitate the development of new animal models to test their efficacy. The COST
Action MouseAGE is a European network whose aim is to reach consensus on the
translational path required for geroprotectors, interventions targeting the
biology of ageing. In our previous work we identified frailty and loss of
resilience as a potential target for geroprotectors. Frailty is the result of an 
accumulation of deficits, which occurs with age and reduces the ability to
respond to adverse events (physical resilience). Modelling frailty and physical
resilience in mice is challenging for many reasons. There is no consensus on the 
precise definition of frailty and resilience in patients or on how best to
measure it. This makes it difficult to evaluate available mouse models. In
addition, the characterization of those models is poor. Here we review potential 
models of physical resilience, focusing on those where there is some evidence
that the administration of acute stressors requires integrative responses
involving multiple tissues and where aged mice showed a delayed recovery or a
worse outcome then young mice in response to the stressor. These models include
sepsis, trauma, drug- and radiation exposure, kidney and brain ischemia, exposure
to noise, heat and cold shock.

Under normal conditions, inflammation is a protective and physiological response 
to various harmful stimuli. However, in several chronic debilitating disorders,
such as chronic kidney disease, inflammation becomes maladaptive, uncontrolled
and persistent. Systemic persistent inflammation has, for almost 20 years, been
recognized as a major contributor to the uraemic phenotype (such as
cardiovascular disease, protein energy wasting, depression, osteoporosis and
frailty), and a predictor of cardiovascular and total mortality. Since
inflammation is mechanistically related to several ageing processes
(inflammageing), it may be a major driver of a progeric phenotype in the uraemic 
milieu. Inflammation is likely the consequence of a multifactorial aetiology and 
interacts with a number of factors that emerge when uraemic toxins accumulate.
Beside interventions aiming to decrease the production of inflammatory molecules 
in the uraemic milieu, novel strategies to increase the removal of large middle
molecules, such as expanded haemodialysis, may be an opportunity to decrease the 
inflammatory allostatic load associated with retention of middle molecular weight
uraemic toxins.

The burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) is projected to increase substantially
over the next decade in parallel with the aging of the population. The increasing
age, level of comorbidity, and polypharmacy will complicate the treatment of
older adults with AF. For instance, advanced age and chronic kidney disease have 
been shown to increase the risk of both thromboembolism and bleeding in patients 
with AF. Frailty, recurrent falls and polypharmacy, while very common among
elderly patients with AF, are often overlooked in the clinical decision making
despite their significant interaction with oral anticoagulant (OAC) and profound 
impact on the patient's clinical outcomes. Such factors should be recognized,
evaluated and considered in a comprehensive decision-making process. The
introduction of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants has radically changed the
management of AF allowing for a more individualized selection of OAC. An
understanding of the available data regarding the performance of each of the
available OAC in a variety of at risk patient populations is paramount for the
safe and effective management of this patient population. The aim of this review 
is to appraise the current evidence, point out the gaps in knowledge, and provide
recommendations regarding stroke prevention in older adults with AF and comorbid 
conditions.

BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated the Timed Up and Go Test's (TUGT) ability
to forecast postoperative outcomes for several surgical specialties. Evaluations 
of the TUGT for waitlist and posttransplant outcomes have yet to be examined in
kidney transplantation.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic utility of the TUGT and its associations with
waitlist and posttransplant outcomes for kidney transplant candidates.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Single-center, prospective study of 518 patients who
performed TUGT during their transplant evaluation between 9/1/2013-11/30/2014.
TUGT times were evaluated as a continuous variable or 3-level discrete
categorical variable with TUGT times categorized as long (>9 seconds), average
(8-9 seconds), or short (5-8 seconds).
RESULTS: Transplanted individuals had shorter TUGT times than those who remained 
on the waitlist (8.99 vs 9.79 seconds, P < 0.001). Bivariable and multivariable
logistic regression showed that after adjusting for age, there was no association
between TUGT times and probability of waitlist removal (OR 0.997 [0.814-1.221]), 
prolonged length of stay posttransplant (OR 1.113 [0.958-1.306] for deceased
donor, OR 0.983 [0.757-1.277] for living donor), and 30-day readmissions (OR
0.984 [0.845-1.146] for deceased donor, OR 1.254 [0.976-1.613] for living donor).
CONCLUSIONS: The TUGT was not associated with waitlist removal or prolonged
hospitalization for kidney transplant candidates. Alternative assessments of
global health, such as functional status or frailty, should be considered for
evaluation of potential kidney transplant candidates.

BACKGROUND: Up to 31% of kidney transplant (KT) recipients experience early
hospital readmission (EHR). We hypothesized that EHR among older KT recipients is
higher than younger recipients due to increased comorbidities and higher
prevalence of frailty.
METHODS: We identified 22,458 older (age ≥65) and 86,372 younger (18 to < 65)
first-time KT recipients (December 1, 1999 - December 31, 2014) using United
States Renal Data System data. We estimated the association between patient-level
characteristics and EHR (30 days post-KT discharge) with modified Poisson
regression among older and younger KT recipients, separately. We estimated the
association between graft loss and mortality and EHR using Cox proportional
hazards.
RESULTS: EHR was more common in older KT recipients (30.1 vs. 27.6%; p < 0.001). 
Risk factors for EHR that differed by recipient age included female sex, African 
American race, diabetes, smoking, dialysis vintage, donor age, and length of
stay. Risk of graft loss associated with EHR was greater among older KT
recipients (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.64, 95% CI 1.51-1.77, p < 0.001) than
younger KT recipients (aHR 1.43, 95% CI 1.38-1.48, p < 0.001; interaction p <
0.01). However, the risk of mortality associated with EHR was greater among
younger recipients (aHR 1.52, 95% CI 1.47-1.57, p < 0.001) than that in older
-recipients (aHR 1.40, 95% CI 1.34-1.47, p < 0.001; interaction p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Older KT recipients are more likely to experience EHR and are at a
higher risk of graft loss after EHR than younger recipients. Targeted
interventions to prevent EHR and subsequent graft loss in this population should 
be identified.

Kidney transplant wait-list management is becoming increasingly complex. We
introduced a novel wait-list management strategy at our center, the Transplant
Readiness Assessment Clinic (TRAC), whereby patients whose Kidney Allocation
Scores surpass a threshold are actively managed. From January 1, 2016 through
June 30, 2017, we evaluated 195 patients through TRAC. Compared to pre-TRAC
systems at our institution, TRAC resulted in a higher proportion of activation at
18 months (38% vs 22%-26%, P < 0.0001), despite being enriched in patients with
long dialysis duration. TRAC also resulted in a higher proportion of wait-list
removal (15% vs 8%-9%, P < 0.05) although combined wait-list removal and death on
wait-list did not differ (18% vs 16%-17%). Median time to activation was 356 days
from TRAC evaluation. Of the transplant barriers, need for cardiovascular studies
was the most common (31%), followed by other medical issues (23%), poor
functional status (13%), and psychosocial issues (10%). By concentrating center
resources on patients most likely to be transplanted after activation and
performing active patient management close to the time of transplant, TRAC has
the potential to significantly enhance kidney transplant success in regions with 
long wait-times.

In the case of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), physicians are facing more
and more difficulties in managing VTE and their treatment in frail patients.
These patients could present several risk situations such as: chronic kidney
disease (CKD), underweight or malnourished, falls, cognitive impairment,
multi-medicated patients, cancer and pregnancy. Guidelines typically recommend
anticoagulation. There are multiple challenges in the safe use of anticoagulation
in frail patients, including bleeding risk, monitoring and adherence, and
polypharmacy. The objective of this review is to explore these at-risk situations
and to suggest adequate anticoagulation therapy, when possible, in each of these 
complex situations.

BACKGROUND: Patients on dialysis are physically inactive, with most reporting
activity levels below the fifth percentile of healthy age-matched groups. Several
small studies have reported efficacy of diverse exercise interventions among
persons with CKD and those on dialysis. However, no single intervention has been 
widely adopted in real-world practice, despite a clear need in this vulnerable
population with high rates of mortality, frailty, and skilled nursing
hospitalizations.
METHODS/DESIGN: We describe a pragmatic clinical trial for an exercise
intervention among patients transitioning to dialysis. We will use an existing
framework - Exercise is Medicine (EIM) - developed by the American College of
Sports Medicine. After undertaking formative qualitative research to tailor the
EIM framework to the advanced CKD population (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m2), we will
randomize 96 patients from two regions-Atlanta and Bay Area-in two intervention
arms with incremental levels of clinical-community integration: physical activity
assessment during Nephrology clinical visit, brief counseling at pre-dialysis
education, and physical activity wearable (group 1) versus group 1 intervention
components plus a referral to a free, EIM practitioner-led group exercise program
over 16 weeks (group 2; 8 week core intervention; 8-week follow up). We will
assess efficacy by comparing between group differences in minutes/week of
objectively measured moderate intensity physical activity. To evaluate
implementation, we will use questionnaires for assessing barriers to referral,
participation and retention along the path of the intervention. Further we will
have a plan for dissemination of the intervention by partnering with relevant
stakeholders.
DISCUSSION: The overall goal is to inform the development of a practical,
cost-conscious intervention "package" that addresses barriers and challenges to
physical activity commonly faced by patients with advanced CKD and can be
disseminated amongst interested practices.

The decision about when to start dialysis for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is 
complex and is influenced by many factors. ESKD-related symptoms and signs are
the most common indications for dialysis initiation. Creatinine-based formulae to
estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are inaccurate in patients with ESKD
and, thus, the decision to start dialysis should not be based solely on estimated
GFR (eGFR). Early dialysis initiation (ie, at an eGFR > 10 mL/min/1.73
m<sup>2</sup>) is not associated with a morbidity and mortality benefit, as shown
in the Initiating Dialysis Early and Late (IDEAL) study. This observation has
been incorporated into the latest guidelines, which place greater emphasis on the
assessment of patients' symptoms and signs rather than eGFR. It is suggested that
in asymptomatic patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease, dialysis may be
safely delayed until the eGFR is at least as low as 5-7 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>
if there is careful clinical follow-up and adequate patient education. The
decision on when to start dialysis is even more challenging in older patients.
Due to their comorbidities and frailty, dialysis initiation may be associated
with worse outcomes and quality of life. Therefore, the decision to start
dialysis in these patients should be carefully weighed against its risks, and
conservative care should be considered in appropriate cases. To optimise the
decision-making process for dialysis initiation, patients need to be referred to 
a nephrologist in a timely fashion to allow adequate pre-dialysis care and
planning. Dialysis initiation and its timing should be a shared decision between 
physician, patients and family members, and should be tailored to the individual 
patient's needs.

Prescribing in heart failure (HF), a common disease state that predominantly
affects the older population, is often a challenging task because of the dynamic 
nature of the condition, requiring frequent monitoring and medication review, the
presence of various comorbidities, and the frailty phenotype of many patients.
The significant alterations in various organs and tissues occurring in HF,
particularly the reduced cardiac output with peripheral hypoperfusion and the
structural and functional changes of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and
kidney, might affect the pharmacokinetics of several drugs. This review
critically appraises the results of published studies investigating the
pharmacokinetics of currently marketed cardiovascular and selected
non-cardiovascular drugs in HF patients and control groups, identifies gaps in
the current knowledge, and suggests avenues for future research in this complex
patient population.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence is reported to be 10 times higher
in aged people. Related to their higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease
(CKD), older patients are at high risk of toxic effects driven by drugs.
METHODS: The demographics, hospitalizations, visits to the Emergency Department, 
pharmacological therapy, and lab tests were analyzed in 71,588 individuals.
RESULTS: Data showed a higher prevalence of AKI as well as CKD in the elderly as 
compared to the younger group, with an associated very high mortality. A broad
number of drugs was prescribed, ranging from 1 to 35, the majority being between 
5 and 9 drugs.
CONCLUSION: Elderly patients who developed AKI had a higher number of
hospitalizations (underlying frailty), were more likely to progress to more
severe stages of CKD and to be affected by other non-renal pathologies
(associated comorbidities) and to be given heavier pharmacological prescriptions 
(polypharmacy).

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reflects a patient's perceived
disease burden, treatment effectiveness, and health status. Given the time burden
and physiologic effects of hemodialysis, patients who spend dialysis time (9-15
h/week) physically or intellectually engaged may have better HRQOL. We
characterized the intradialytic activities and explored their association with
HRQOL.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 431 hemodialysis patients, we ascertained 
kidney-disease-specific quality of life, measured frailty, and surveyed
participants about their usual active intradialytic activities (reading, playing 
games, doing puzzles, chatting, or other) and passive intradialytic activities
(watching TV or sleeping). We used adjusted ordered logistic regression to
identify correlates of the activity index (the sum of active intradialytic
activities) and adjusted linear regression to quantify the association between
the activity index and physical-, mental-, and kidney-disease-specific HRQOL.
RESULTS: The 2 most common intradialytic activities were passive activities
(watching TV = 87.9%; sleeping = 72.4%). Participants who were female (aOR 1.85, 
95% CI 1.28-2.66; p = 0.001), nonfrail (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.06-2.70; p = 0.03),
and nonsmokers (aOR 2.61, 95% CI 1.39-4.90; p = 0.003) had a higher intradialytic
activity index after adjustment. Higher intradialytic activity index was
associated with better mental- (0.83 points, 95% CI 0.04-1.62; p = 0.04) and
kidney-disease-specific HRQOL (1.70 points, 95% CI 0.47-2.93; p = 0.007), but not
physical HRQOL.
CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis patients with more active intradialytic activities
report better mental and kidney-disease-specific HRQOL. These results should be
confirmed in a prospective study with a broader cohort of hemodialysis patients. 
Dialysis providers may consider offering patients with low levels of activity
additional support and opportunities to engage in beneficial intradialytic
activities.

Depressive symptoms and frailty are each independently associated with morbidity 
and mortality in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. We hypothesized that having
both depressive symptoms and frailty would be synergistic and worse than the
independent effect of each. In a multicenter cohort study of 773 KT recipients,
we measured the Fried frailty phenotype and the modified 18-question Center for
Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Using adjusted Poisson regression
and survival analysis, we tested whether depressive symptoms (CES-D score > 14)
and frailty were associated with KT length of stay (LOS), death-censored graft
failure (DCGF), and mortality. At KT admission, 10.0% of patients exhibited
depressive symptoms, 16.3% were frail, and 3.6% had both. Recipients with
depressive symptoms were more likely to be frail (aOR = 3.97, 95% CI: 2.28-6.91, 
P < 0.001). Recipients with both depressive symptoms and frailty had a 1.88 times
(95% CI: 1.70-2.08, P < 0.001) longer LOS, 6.20-fold (95% CI:1.67-22.95,
P < 0.01) increased risk of DCGF, and 2.62-fold (95% CI:1.03-6.70,
P = 0.04) increased risk of mortality, compared to those who were nonfrail and
without depressive symptoms. There was only evidence of synergistic effect of
frailty and depressive symptoms on length of stay (P for interaction < 0.001).
Interventions aimed at reducing pre-KT depressive symptoms and frailty should be 
explored for their impact on post-KT outcomes.

AIM: The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether
pre-operative hypoalbuminaemia (<35 g/L) is associated with adverse outcomes post
kidney transplantation.
METHODS: Our retrospective, single-centre analysis included all patients who
received their kidney transplant between 2007 and 2017, with documented admission
albumin levels prior to surgery. Survival analyses were undertaken to explore the
relationship of pre-transplant hypoalbuminaemia versus other baseline variables
upon post-transplant outcomes.
RESULTS: We analysed 1,131 kidney allograft recipients transplanted at our center
(2007-2017), with median follow up 746 days (IQR 133-1,750 days). Kidney
transplant recipients with pre-operative hypoalbuminaemia were more likely older,
female, recipients of deceased-donor kidneys and to have longer cold ischaemic
times. Recipients with pre-operative hypoalbuminaemia had longer hospital
admissions post-operatively but no difference in delayed graft function rates.
There was no difference in 1-year creatinine but recipients with hypoalbuminaemia
had reduced risk for cellular rejection. We observed significantly worse patient 
survival (83.2% versus 90.7%, p<0.001) and overall graft survival (72.5% versus
82.0%, p<0.001) for recipients with hypoalbuminaemia versus normal albumin levels
respectively but no difference in death-censored graft survival. In a Cox
regression model, adjusted for baseline pre-operative variables, hypoalbuminaemia
was independently associated with an increased risk for overall graft loss after 
kidney transplantation (hazard ratio 1.468, 95% CI 1.087-1.982, p=0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative hypoalbuminaemia is an independent risk factor for
overall graft loss after kidney transplantation. Further work is warranted to
investigate the underlying pathophysiology to determine what supportive measures 
can be undertaken to attenuate adverse post-transplant outcomes. This article is

In Japan, which is entering a super-aged society, the prevention of long-term
care and bedridden caused by frailty and sarcopenia have been recognized as an
urgent need. The pathology of frailty and sarcopenia includes broad problems of
senility. A traditional herbal medicine is known to improve symptoms across the
organs, many herbal medicines administered by examining the balance of mind and
body are effective for frailty and sarcopenia. "The Safety Drug Therapy Guideline
2015 for the Elderly" was fully revised in 2015. In this guideline, traditional
herbal medicines, which are suggested to be useful for the elderly, have been
taken up, and the evidence of which is being accumulated. We regarded frailty and
sarcopenia as 'kidney-Qi' deficiency, a concept that represents aging phenomenon 
in Kampo medicine and clarified the anti-sarcopenic effects of Go-sha-jinki-gan, 
a 'kidney-Qi'-tonifying medicine, using animal experimental models.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects 10%-15% of the population, associates
with a range of complications-such as cardiovascular disease, frailty,
infections, muscle and bone disorders and premature ageing-that could be related 
to alterations of mitochondrial number, distribution, structure and function. As 
mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetics and the dynamic mitochondrial networks
directly or indirectly regulate numerous intra- and extracellular functions, the 
mitochondria have emerged as an important target for interventions aiming at
preventing or improving the treatment of complications in CKD. In this review, we
discuss the possible role of bioactive food compounds and exercise in the
modulation of the disturbed mitochondrial function in a uraemic milieu.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of low physiological reserve and multi-systemic
dysregulation that leads to susceptibility to external stressors; it is
associated with adverse outcomes. North American data suggest that haemodialysis 
recipients are more likely to be frail than the general population, although data
on UK cohorts are lacking. Furthermore, with a multitude of assessment tools, it 
is difficult for the clinician to ascertain which is most suitable for this
population. The FITNESS Study aims to measure the prevalence and outcomes
associated with frailty in a large UK haemodialysis cohort to determine the
optimum frailty tool as defined by predictive value for mortality/hospitalisation
and to conduct a feasibility study exploring a multi-disciplinary clinical
intervention to improve frailty among haemodialysis recipients.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study will follow a cohort multiple randomised controlled
trial design; the initial cohort study will identify participants to be invited
into a subsequent open-label randomised controlled trial. Eligible patients will 
be identified and recruited from their usual haemodialysis session. They will be 
invited to complete tasks and questionnaires collecting data on sarcopenia,
immunosenescence, mood, cognition, disability, and comorbidity. Fifty pre-frail
participants with suitable English proficiency will be randomly selected from
this cohort to participate in the randomised controlled trial phase of the study.
Further stratified randomisation will occur to assign these 50 participants to
active or passive groups. The active group will receive a psychologically
supported, patient-centred, multi-disciplinary intervention into frailty, in what
we believe to be a first within this patient group. The control group will
receive usual haemodialysis standard of care. All participants will be followed
up using electronic patient records for outcomes to include hospitalisation and
mortality. Primary outcomes for this phase of the study will be feasibility and
tolerability of the clinical intervention study.
DISCUSSION: The study will collect data on multiple aspects of frailty allowing
for a rich dataset for detailed analysis. We believe this will be the first study
to explore a psychologically supported, patient-centred intervention in this
patient group.

OBJECTIVES: Frailty can cause increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes,
such as falls, fractures, depression and reduced health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). This cross-sectional study compared the differences in body composition,
HRQoL, mental health and cognitive and vitamin D (vitD) status with health-care
utilization by frail and nonfrail adults with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 
2) and with chronic kidney disease (stages 1 through 5).
METHODS: We studied adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney
disease stages 1 through 5 who were participating in a longitudinal follow-up
study (41 to 83 years of age; n=41). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry); vitD status (serum 25[OH]D3); frailty (Edmonton Frail Scale);
depression (Major Depression Inventory); HRQoL (Short Form Health Survey-36); and
cognitive status (Mini Mental State exam) were measured using validated tools.
Participants who were on dialysis and had body weights >136 kg, and coinciding
comorbidities known to influence vitD metabolism were excluded.
RESULTS: Frailty occurred in 17% of participants (n=7). Frail participants had
lower lean body mass, lower HRQoL scores (individual and composite scores), more 
depression (p=<0.05) and higher numbers of health visits (total, inpatient and
emergency) compared with nonfrail participants (p<0.05). No differences in
health-care visit types or vitD status were noted between frail and nonfrail
participants (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in an ambulatory population of adults with chronic kidney
disease and diabetes is associated with low lean body mass, low HRQoL, greater
depression and higher numbers of health-care visits.

BACKGROUND: We retrospectively assessed the initial clinical role of preoperative
frailty in surgical patients with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection (AAAD).
METHODS: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients who underwent emergent or 
urgent surgical interventions for AAAD in our institute between April 2000 and
March 2016 participated in this retrospective study. Patients with more than
three of the following six modalities were defined as being frail: age older than
75 years, preoperative requirement of assistance in daily living, body mass index
less than 18.5 kg/m2, female, history of major stroke, and chronic kidney disease
greater than class 3b. Twenty-three patients (20.2%) were diagnosed with frailty 
(group F), while 91 patients (79.8%) were not (group N). Early clinical outcomes,
major postoperative complications, postoperative recovery of activity, and early 
or mid-term survival were evaluated.
RESULTS: Although early clinical outcomes and the prevalence of major
postoperative complications were similar in both groups, postoperative activity
of daily living (ADL), such as the rate of being ambulatory on discharge
(p < 0.05) and home discharge (p < 0.01), was significantly lower in group F than
in group N. A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that 1- and 5-year survival rates
were similar in groups F (85.9 and 76.4%, respectively) and N (86.0 and 76.9%,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative frailty in AAAD surgical patients has potential as a
prognostic factor that affects delays in ADL recovery, but does not influence the
early or mid-term clinical outcomes of prompt surgical strategies for life rescue
in AAAD patients with frailty.

Immunosuppression may occur for a number of reasons related to an individual's
frailty, debility, disease or from therapeutic iatrogenic intervention or
misadventure. A large percentage of morbidity and mortality in immunodeficient
populations is related to an inadequate response to infectious agents with slow
response to antibiotics, enhancements of antibiotic resistance in populations,
and markedly increased prevalence of acute inflammatory response, septic and
infection related death. Given known relationships between intracellular calcium 
ion concentrations and cytotoxicity and cellular death, we looked at currently
available data linking blockade of calcium ion channels and potential decrease in
expression of sepsis among immunosuppressed patients. Notable are relationships
between calcium, calcium channel, vitamin D mechanisms associated with sepsis and
demonstration of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that may utilize channels
sensitive to calcium channel blocker. We note that sepsis shock syndrome
represents loss of regulation of inflammatory response to infection and that
vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor, and klotho interact
with sepsis defense mechanisms in which movement of calcium and phosphorus are
part of the process. Given these observations we consider that further
investigation of the effect of relatively inexpensive calcium channel blockade
agents of infections in immunosuppressed populations might be worthwhile.

The introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in the 1990s has
dramatically changed the course of HIV infection, decreasing the risk for both
AIDS- and non-AIDS-related events. Cancers, cardiovascular disease (CVD), liver
and kidney disease, neurological disorders and frailty have become of great
importance lately in the clinical management as they represent the principal
cause of death in people living with HIV who receive cART (Kirk et al. in Clin
Infect Dis 45(1):103-10, 2007; Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral
Therapy Study et al. N Engl J Med 355(22):2283-2296, 2006; Ances et al. J Infect 
Dis 201(3):336-340, 2010; Desquilbet et al. J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci
62(11):1279-1286, 2007; Lifson et al. HIV Clin Trials 9(3):177-185, 2008).
Despite the undeniable achievements of cART, we are now faced with its
limitations: a considerable proportion of individuals, referred as to
immunological non-responders, fails to reconstitute the immune system despite
optimal treatment and viral suppression (Kelley et al. Clin Infect Dis
48(6):787-794, 2009; Robbins et al. Clin Infect Dis 48(3):350-361, 2009) and
remains at high risk for opportunistic infections and non-AIDS-related events
(Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy Study et al. N Engl J Med
355(22):2283-2296, 2006). Moreover, the generalized state of immune activation
and inflammation, linked to serious non-AIDS events, persists despite successful 
HIV suppression with cART. Finally, the current strategies have so far failed to 
eradicate the virus, and inflammation appears a driving force in viral
persistence. In the light of all this, it is of fundamental importance to

Currently, there are no tools to predict postsurgery outcome after kidney
transplantation. This study assesses whether frailty influence 30-day
postoperative complications after kidney transplantation. One-hundred and fifty
kidney transplantations were prospectively included. Frailty was assessed using a
frailty indicator, consisting of 15 questions, covering most domains of
functioning. Postoperative complications were measured by the Comprehensive
Complication Index (CCI). Using a linear regression model, 30-day postoperative
complications and frailty correlation were adjusted for confounders, including
sex, age, ASA Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, BMI, smoking,
dialysis, duration of dialysis, type of transplantation, and retransplantation.
The mean frailty score was 2.07(±1.6) and 23 patients were classified as frail
(GFI ≥4). The mean CCI-score was 18(±15.6), the mean CCI-score for "frail"
patients 30.1(±17.2) compared to 15.5 (±14.2) for "non-frail" patients (N = 116).
In a regression analysis, a significant relationship between CCI-score and
frailty (β = 13.3; 95% CI 5.7-20.9; P = 0.0007) and transplantation type (β =
4.9; 95% CI: 0.72-9.16; P = 0.02) was found, independent of confounders. In
conclusion, frailty and type of transplantation are independent factors
associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications.

Background: Hand grip strength (HGS) is a key measurement in the assessment of
frailty phenotype in haemodialysis patients. However, the measurement is not very
standardized, and notably, current data on the potential impact of a
haemodialysis session on the results are both limited and controversial. In the
present analysis, we compared HGS results before and after a haemodialysis
session in 101 patients.
Methods: In the current observational study, HGS has been measured in adult
haemodialysis patients on the same day, first before connection to the dialysis
machine and then just after disconnection. At each timing, measurements were
repeated three times with an interval of 5 s between measurements and the higher 
value was used for analysis.
Results: One hundred and one patients (64% men) with a median (interquartile
range, 25th percentile; 75th percentile) age of 66 (46; 76) years were included. 
In the whole population, a significant decline in HGS was observed after
dialysis, with an absolute median decline of - 4 (0; -6) kg and a relative median
difference of -11 (0; -20)%. These differences were observed in both genders and 
were independent of the baseline HGS value.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the timing (before or after the dialysis
session) of hand grip assessment is clinically relevant and should be taken into 
account in clinical practice and also in epidemiological and clinical studies.

Aging is an important risk factor for patients with atrial fibrillation. The
estimated prevalence of atrial fibrillation in patients aged ≥80 years is 9-10%, 
and is associated with a four to five fold increased risk of embolic stroke, and 
with an estimated increased stroke risk of 1.45-fold per decade in aging. Older
age is also associated with an increased risk of major bleeding with oral
anticoagulant therapy. This review will focus on the role of oral anticoagulation
with new oral anticoagulants, non-vitamin K antagonist in populations with common
comorbid conditions, including age, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery
disease, on multiple medication, and frailty. In patients 75 years and older,
randomised trials have shown new oral anticoagulants to be as effective as
warfarin, or in some cases superior, with an overall better safety profile,
consistently reducing rates of intracranial haemorrhages. Prior to considering
oral anticoagulant therapy in an elderly frail patient, a comprehensive
assessment should be performed to include the risks and benefits, stroke risk,
baseline kidney function, cognitive status, mobility and fall risk, multiple
medication, nutritional status assessment, and life expectancy.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between subjective cognitive decline and frailty,
two components of the so-called reversible cognitive frailty, in the elderly
remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate whether this association exists,
independent of confounding factors such as nutritional status, kidney function,
inflammation, and insulin resistance.
METHODS: 2386 participants (≥ 65 years of age) selected from the Healthy Aging
Longitudinal Study in Taiwan (HALST) study. Fried frailty phenotype was adopted
to quantify frailty status. We classified cognitive status into two
categories-subjective cognitive decline (SCD), and normal cognition-and used
polytomous logistic regressions to investigate the associations between SCD and
frailty.
RESULTS: There were 188 (7.88%), 1228 (51.47%), and 970 (40.65%) participants
with frailty, pre-frailty, and robustness, respectively. Compared to those with
normal cognition, elders with SCD were more likely to have pre-frailty (odds
ratio [OR]: 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.67, p = 0.004) or frailty 
(OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.23-2.58, p = 0.002) after adjusting for age, gender,
education level, comorbidity, nutritional status, kidney function, and
biochemical-related factors.
CONCLUSIONS: A significant association between subjective cognitive decline and
frailty was revealed in this study. Subjective cognitive decline was positively
associated with pre-frailty or frailty even after adjusting for potential
confounding factors. Our results can provide useful references in understanding
mechanisms and developing suitable preventive strategies for the elderly with
reversible cognitive frailty.

Inflammageing: chronic inflammation in ageing, cardiovascular disease,
and frailty.

Most older individuals develop inflammageing, a condition characterized by
elevated levels of blood inflammatory markers that carries high susceptibility to
chronic morbidity, disability, frailty, and premature death. Potential mechanisms
of inflammageing include genetic susceptibility, central obesity, increased gut
permeability, changes to microbiota composition, cellular senescence, NLRP3
inflammasome activation, oxidative stress caused by dysfunctional mitochondria,
immune cell dysregulation, and chronic infections. Inflammageing is a risk factor
for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and clinical trials suggest that this
association is causal. Inflammageing is also a risk factor for chronic kidney
disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, depression, dementia, and sarcopenia, but
whether modulating inflammation beneficially affects the clinical course of
non-CVD health problems is controversial. This uncertainty is an important issue 
to address because older patients with CVD are often affected by multimorbidity
and frailty - which affect clinical manifestations, prognosis, and response to
treatment - and are associated with inflammation by mechanisms similar to those
in CVD. The hypothesis that inflammation affects CVD, multimorbidity, and frailty
by inhibiting growth factors, increasing catabolism, and interfering with
homeostatic signalling is supported by mechanistic studies but requires
confirmation in humans. Whether early modulation of inflammageing prevents or
delays the onset of cardiovascular frailty should be tested in clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: There is limited data on hospital readmissions following
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aim of this study was to
investigate hospital readmissions post-TAVI.
METHODS: Data from the Optimized transCathEter vAlvular iNtervention (OCEAN-TAVI)
multicenter registry (registration no. UMIN000020423) were collected from 1215
patients who underwent TAVI. Incidence, timing, causes, and predictors of
readmission in addition to the impact on patient outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of 1215 patients, 223 (18.4%) were readmitted within 1 year post-TAVI.
Early readmission (≤30 days) occurred in 42 patients, while late readmission
(>30 days) occurred in 181 patients. Readmissions were due to cardiac disorders, 
such as heart failure and arrhythmia, in 77 patients and non-cardiac disorders,
such as respiratory disorders, infections, and cerebrovascular events, in 146
patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that early readmission was associated
with a lower 1-year survival compared to non-early readmission (72.4% vs. 89.0%, 
p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that acute kidney injury
(hazard ratio [HR], 2.27; p = 0.03) was an independent predictor of early
readmission, while anemia (HR, 2.21; p < 0.01), hypoalbuminemia (HR, 1.37;
p = 0.04), atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.70; p < 0.01), and more than mild
postprocedural aortic regurgitation (HR, 1.62; p < 0.01) were independent
predictors of late readmission.
CONCLUSION: Readmission occurred in approximately one-fifth of patients post-TAVI
and was associated with poor patient outcomes. Early readmission was mainly due
to procedural complications, while late readmission was mainly determined by
baseline comorbidities including a frailty criterion. Measures should be taken to
reduce hospital readmissions and improve patient outcomes post-TAVI.

INTRODUCTION: As the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension is
increasing. Treatment of hypertension is associated with a reduction in
cardiovascular risk. However, the optimal blood pressure targets in older people 
are not clearly defined due to paucity of randomised clinical trials specific to 
this age group. Areas covered: We performed a Medline and Embase search from 1998
to present for articles on the management of hypertension in older people
published in English language. Expert commentary: The recent guidelines have
suggested a lower blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mmHg. Due to the
heterogeneity of older people, this universal low target may not be applicable to
all of them. Targets based on functional level rather than chronological age are 
more appropriate. Special considerations in older people such as increased
prevalence of frailty, falls, dementia, polypharmacy and the predominance of
isolated systolic hypertension should also be taken into account. Tighter
control, if well tolerated, is suitable for the fit person but relaxed targets
are more reasonable in individuals with physical or cognitive decline. Therefore,
in older people, targets should be individualised putting quality, rather than
quantity, of life at the heart of their care plans.

A comprehensive literature review of iron status in the elderly was undertaken in
order to update a previous review (Fairweather-Tait et al, 2014); 138 summarised 
papers describe research on the magnitude of the problem, aetiology and
age-related physiological changes that may affect iron status, novel strategies
for assessing iron status with concurrent health conditions, hepcidin, lifestyle 
factors, iron supplements, iron status and health outcomes (bone mineral density,
frailty, inflammatory bowel disease, kidney failure, cancer, cardiovascular, and 
neurodegenerative diseases). Each section of this review concludes with key
points from the relevant papers. The overall findings were that disturbed iron
metabolism plays a major role in a large number of conditions associated with old
age. Correction of iron deficiency/overload may improve disease prognosis, but
diagnosis of iron deficiency requires appropriate cut-offs for biomarkers of iron
status in elderly men and women to be agreed. Iron deficiency (with or without
anemia), anemia of inflammation, and anemia of chronic disease are all widespread
in the elderly and, once identified, should be investigated further as they are
often indicative of underlying disease. Management options should be reviewed and
updated, and novel therapies, which show potential for treating anemia of
inflammation or chronic disease, should be considered.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Withdrawal from maintenance hemodialysis before death 
has become more common because of high disease and treatment burden. The study
objective was to identify patient factors and examine the terminal course
associated with hemodialysis withdrawal, and assess patterns of palliative care
involvement before death among patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We designed an observational
cohort study of adult patients on incident hemodialysis in a midwestern United
States tertiary center, from January 2001 to November 2013, with death events
through to November 2015. Logistic regression models evaluated associations
between patient characteristics and withdrawal status and palliative care service
utilization.
RESULTS: Among 1226 patients, 536 died and 262 (49% of 536) withdrew. A random
sample (10%; 52 out of 536) review of Death Notification Forms revealed 73%
sensitivity for withdrawal. Risk factors for withdrawal before death included
older age, white race, palliative care consultation within 6 months,
hospitalization within 30 days, cerebrovascular disease, and no coronary artery
disease. Most withdrawal decisions were made by patients (60%) or a family member
(33%; surrogates). The majority withdrew either because of acute medical
complications (51%) or failure to thrive/frailty (22%). After withdrawal, median 
time to death was 7 days (interquartile range, 4-11). In-hospital deaths were
less common in the withdrawal group (34% versus 46% nonwithdrawal, P=0.003). A
third (34%; 90 out of 262) of those that withdrew received palliative care
services. Palliative care consultation in the withdrawal group was associated
with longer hemodialysis duration (odds ratio, 1.19 per year; 95% confidence
interval, 1.10 to 1.3; P<0.001), hospitalization within 30 days of death (odds
ratio, 5.78; 95% confidence interval, 2.62 to 12.73; P<0.001), and death in
hospital (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 3.27; P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: In this single-center study, the rate of hemodialysis withdrawals
were twice the frequency previously described. Acute medical complications and
frailty appeared to be driving factors. However, palliative care services were
used in only a minority of patients.

More than one-third of US adults have limited health literacy, putting them at
risk of adverse clinical outcomes. We evaluated the prevalence of limited health 
literacy among 1578 adult kidney transplant (KT) candidates (May 2014-November
2017) and examined its association with listing for transplant and waitlist
mortality in this pilot study. Limited health literacy was assessed at KT
evaluation by using a standard cutoff score ≤5 on the Brief Health Literacy
Screen (score range 0-12, lower scores indicate worse health literacy). We used
logistic regression and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to identify risk
factors for limited health literacy and to quantify its association with listing 
and waitlist mortality. We found that 8.9% of candidates had limited health
literacy; risk factors included less than college education (adjusted odds ratio 
[aOR] = 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.86-4.43), frailty (aOR = 1.85, 95%
CI:1.22-2.80), comorbidity (Charlson comorbidity index [1-point increase]
aOR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.20), and cognitive impairment (aOR = 3.45, 95% CI:
2.20-5.41) after adjusting for age, sex, race, and income. Candidates with
limited health literacy had a 30% (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.70, 95% CI:
0.54-0.91) decreased likelihood of listing and a 2.42-fold (95% CI: 1.16- to
5.05-fold) increased risk of waitlist mortality. Limited health literacy may be a
salient mechanism in access to KT; programs to aid candidates with limited health
literacy may improve outcomes and reduce disparities.

Properties of composite time to first event versus joint marginal analyses of
multiple outcomes.

Many clinical studies (eg, cardiovascular outcome trials) investigate the effect 
of an intervention on multiple event time outcomes. The most common method of
analysis is a so-called "composite" analysis of a composite outcome defined as
the time to the first component event. Other approaches have been proposed,
including the win ratio (or win difference) for ordered outcomes and the
application of the Wei-Lachin test. Herein, we assess the influence of the
marginal and joint distributions of the component events, and their correlation
structures, on the operating characteristics of these methods for the analysis of
multiple events. The operating characteristics are investigated using a bivariate
exponential model with a shared frailty, under which these properties are
obtained in closed form. While the composite time-to-first-event analysis
provides an unbiased test of the hypothesis of equality of the distribution of
the time to first event, we show that it can provide a biased test of the joint
null hypothesis of equal marginal hazards when the correlation of event times
differs between groups. The same applies to the win ratio. However, the operating
characteristics of the Wei-Lachin or other tests of the joint equality of the
marginal hazards are unaffected. Furthermore, when the correlations are equal,
the Wei-Lachin test is more powerful to detect a difference in marginal hazards
than the composite analysis test. Careful consideration of the properties of the 
various methods for analysis of composite outcome measures are in order before

BACKGROUND: The association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and functional
status may change as a function of the equation used to estimate glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR). We reviewed the predictive value of different eGFR
equations in regard to frailty and disability outcomes.
METHODS: We searched Pubmed from inception to March 2018 for studies
investigating the association between eGFR and self-reported and/or objective
measures of frailty or disability. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies were 
separately analysed.
RESULTS: We included 16 studies, one of which reporting both cross-sectional and 
longitudinal data. Three out of 7 cross-sectional studies compared different eGFR
equations in regard to their association with functional status: two studies
showed that cystatin C-based, but not creatinine-based eGFR may be associated
with hand-grip strength or frailty; another study showed that two different
creatinine-based eGFR equations may be similarly associated with disability. Four
out of 10 longitudinal studies provided comparative data: two studies reported
similar association with disability for different creatinine-based eGFR
equations; one study showed that creatinine-based eGFR was not associated with
frailty, but a not significant trend for association was observed with cystatin
C-based eGFR; one study showed that cystatin C-based but not creatinine-based
eGFR may predict incident mobility disability, while both methods may predict
gait speed decline. High heterogeneity was observed in regard to confounders
included in reviewed studies. None of them included the most recently published
equations.
CONCLUSION: Available data do not support the superiority of one of the eGFR
equations in terms of measuring or predicting functional decline.

Increases in rates of obesity in the older population are hastening the
development of chronic illnesses, including chronic kidney disease (CKD).
However, obesity reduction in older adults is besought with concerns about the
long-term benefit/risk, especially regarding loss of muscle mass and its impact
on function. Higher protein intakes have been advocated to help offset the
tendency for loss of muscle during weight reduction but this raises concerns
about possible negative effects on older kidneys. We assessed markers of renal
function in venous blood samples collected during a six-month randomized
controlled weight loss trial of higher protein intake in obese (n = 67;
BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) older (≥60 years) adults with physical frailty and age-normal
renal status (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≥ 45); the Control diet (0.8 g
protein/kg body weight/day; n = 21) was compared to a protein-enhanced (1.2 g/g
protein/kg body weight/day with 30 g protein/meal; n = 41; Protein) diet. Results
showed no group effect of the Protein treatment on markers of renal function
(estimated GFR, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine), either upon intervention
completion or one year later. Our findings align with literature support for the 
benefits of higher protein in the diets of older individuals during obesity
reduction and help to confirm the safety of moderate increases in protein intake 
during weight loss in this population.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Adverse outcomes for hospitalized patients with sarcopenia are
well documented, and identification of patients at risk remains challenging. The 
sarcopenia index (SI), previously defined as (serum creatinine/serum cystatin
C) × 100, could be an inexpensive, readily accessible, objective tool to predict 
muscle mass and risk for adverse clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to 
assess the validity of the SI as a predictor of muscle mass.
METHODS: Retrospective study of critically ill adults admitted to Mayo Clinic
from 2012 to 2015 with suspected sepsis and an available creatinine and serum
cystatin C. Muscle surface area was quantified at the L3/4 vertebral level in
patients with an abdominal CT scan (CTMSA). Multivariable regression modeling was
used to assess the relationship between SI and CTMSA, as well as short-term
clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The 171 included had a mean weight and body mass index (BMI) of
75.2 ± 16.4 kg and 26.0 ± 4.6 kg/m2 and abdominal CT scans were available for 81 
(47%) patients. The SI correlated with CTMSA (r = 0.40). After adjustment for
age, sex, severity of illness, and BMI, SI was independently associated with
muscle mass (P = 0.001). A decrease in the SI (indicative of lower muscle mass)
was also associated with frailty and worse short-term clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The SI, a simple calculation from kidney function markers, is a
significant predictor of muscle mass in this validation cohort of ICU patients. A
low SI was associated with longer hospital length of stay and frailty. Future
studies could explore whether the use of SI assists with identifying patients
likely to benefit from pharmacotherapy-, nutrition-, or physical therapy-based
interventions.

Background: Hospitalizations of chronic dialysis patients have not been
previously studied at a national level in Canada. Understanding the scope and
variables associated with hospitalizations will inform measures for improvement.
Objective: To describe the risk of all-cause and infection-related
hospitalizations in patients on dialysis.
Design: Retrospective cohort study using health care administrative databases.
Setting: Provinces and territories across Canada (excluding Manitoba and Quebec).
Patients: Incident chronic dialysis patients with a dialysis start date between
January 1, 2005, and March 31, 2014. Patients with a prior history of kidney
transplantation were excluded.
Measurements: Patient characteristics were recorded at baseline. Dialysis
modality was treated as a time-varying covariate. The primary outcomes of
interest were all-cause and dialysis-specific infection-related hospitalizations.
Methods: Crude rates for all-cause hospitalization and infection-related
hospitalization were determined per patient year (PPY) at 7 and 30 days, and at
3, 6, and 12 months postdialysis initiation. A stratified, gamma-distributed
frailty model was used to assess repeat hospital admissions and to determine the 
inter-recurrence dependence of hospitalizations within individuals, as well as
the hazard ratio (HR) attributed to each covariate of interest.
Results: A total of 38 369 incident chronic dialysis patients were included: 38
088 adults and 281 pediatric patients (age less than 18 years). There were 112
374 hospitalizations, of which 11.5% were infection-related hospitalizations. The
all-cause hospitalization rate was similar for all adult age groups (age 65 years
and older: 1.40, 1.35, and 1.18 admissions PPY at 7 days, 30 days, and 6 months, 
respectively). The all-cause hospitalization rate was higher for pediatric
patients (1.67, 2.48, and 2.47 admissions PPY at 7 days, 30 days, and 6 months,
respectively; adjusted HR: 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.37-3.15,
referent age group: 45-64 years). Within the first 7 days after dialysis
initiation, patients on peritoneal dialysis had a higher risk of all-cause
hospitalization (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.07-1.50) and infection-related
hospitalization (HR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.19-3.55) compared with patients on
hemodialysis. Beyond 7 days, the risk did not differ significantly by dialysis
modality. Female sex and Indigenous race were significant risk factors for
all-cause hospitalization.
Limitations: The cohort had too few home hemodialysis patients to examine this
subgroup. The outcome of infection-related hospitalization was determined using
diagnostic codes. Dialysis patients from Manitoba and Quebec were not included.
Conclusions: In Canada, the rates of hospitalization were not influenced by
dialysis modality beyond the initial 7-day period following dialysis initiation; 
however, the rate of hospitalization in pediatric patients was higher than in
adults at every time frame examined.

Publisher: Le taux d’hospitalisation des patients dialysés n’avait jamais fait
l’objet d’une étude pancanadienne. Une connaissance approfondie de la portée et
des variables associées aux hospitalisations orientera les mesures
d’amélioration.L’étude visait à mieux évaluer les risques d’hospitalisations des 
patients dialysés; toutes causes confondues ou liées spécifiquement à une
infection.Il s’agit d’une étude de cohorte rétrospective fondée sur des bases de 
données administratives en santé.L’étude couvrait les provinces et territoires du
Canada à l’exception du Québec et du Manitoba.L’étude a porté sur tous les
patients dialysés à vie dont le traitement avait commencé entre le 1er janvier
2005 et le 31 mars 2014. Les patients ayant reçu une greffe rénale ont été
exclus.Les caractéristiques initiales des patients ont été consignées, et la
modalité de dialyse a été traitée comme une co-variable sujette à changement dans
le temps. La principale issue d’intérêt était une hospitalisation due à une
infection directement liée à la dialyse, ou une hospitalisation toutes causes
confondues.Les taux bruts d’hospitalisations toutes causes confondues (global) et
d’hospitalisations liées à une infection ont été calculés en années-patients
(HAP) à différents moments suivant le début de la dialyse (7 jours, 30 jours, 3
mois, 6 mois et 12 mois). Un modèle stratifié de fragilité à distribution gamma a
été employé pour i) répertorier les hospitalisations répétées; ii) déterminer
l’interrécurrence et le lien de dépendance entre les hospitalisations pour chaque
patient; et iii) établir le rapport de risque (RR) attribué à chaque covariable
d’intérêt.En tout, 38 369 patients dialysés, soit 38 088 adultes et 281 patients 
mineurs (moins de 18 ans) ont été inclus dans l’étude. Au cours de la période
étudiée, on a répertorié 112 374 hospitalisations, dont 11,5 % étaient dues à une
infection en lien direct avec la dialyse. Le taux d’hospitalisations global était
similaire pour tous les groupes d’âge chez les patients adultes. Par exemple,
chez les patients âgés de 65 ans et plus, ce taux se situait respectivement à
1,40 HAP, à 1,35 HAP et à 1,18 HAP lorsque calculé 7 jours, 30 jours et 6 mois
après l’initiation de la dialyse. Lorsque comparé au groupe des 45-64 ans, le
taux d’hospitalisations global s’est avéré plus élevé chez les patients
pédiatriques (1,67 HAP à 7 jours, 2,48 HAP à 30 jours et 2,47 HAP à 6 mois)
post-initiation de la dialyse (RR: 2,73; IC 95 %: 2,37-3,15). Dans les 7 jours
suivant l’initiation du traitement, les patients traités par dialyse péritonéale 
présentaient un risque plus élevé d’hospitalisation toutes causes confondues (RR:
1,27; IC 95 %: 1,07-1,50) ou d’hospitalisation liée à une infection (RR: 2,05; IC
95 %: 1,19-3,55) que les patients hémodialysés. Par contre, cet écart entre les
modalités de dialyse n’était plus observable au-delà des sept premiers jours.
Enfin, le fait d’être autochtone ou de sexe féminin s’avérait un facteur de
risque d’hospitalisation significatif (toutes causes confondues).Plusieurs
facteurs limitent la portée des résultats: i) la cohorte comptait trop peu de
patients hémodialysés à domicile pour permettre une analyse de ce sous-groupe;
ii) les hospitalisations relatives à une infection ont été établies à l’aide de
codes diagnostiques; et iii) les patients dialysés résidant au Québec et au
Manitoba étaient exclus de l’étude.Au Canada, au-delà des sept jours suivant
l’initiation de la dialyse, la modalité employée n’a plus d’influence sur les
taux d’hospitalisations. Cependant, à tous les moments post-initiation mesurés,
les taux d’hospitalisations se sont avérés plus élevés chez les patients
pédiatriques que chez les adultes.

The population undergoing dialysis is aging worldwide, particularly in Japan. The
clinical condition of frailty is the most problematic expression in the elderly
population. Potential pathophysiological factors of frailty present in patients
with CKD and are accentuated in patients with ESRD. The aim of this study was to 
identify the prevalence and predictors of frailty in Japanese HD patients. This
study was a multicenter, cross-sectional and observational investigation
conducted at 6 institutions. To evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty
phenotype adjusted for Japanese as the self-reported questionnaire was used. Of
the 542 patients visiting each institution, 388 were enrolled in this study. In
total, 26.0% of participants were categorized as not-frailty, 52.6% as
pre-frailty and 21.4% as frailty. The prevalence of frailty increased steadily
with age and was more prevalent in females than in males and the subjects with
frailty received polypharmacy. A multivariate logistic regression analysis
revealed that the factors independently associated with frailty were the
following: female gender (odds ratio [OR] = 3.661, 95% confidence interval [CI]
1.398-9.588), age (OR = 1.065, 95% CI 1.014-1.119), age ≥ 75 years old (OR =
4.892, 95% CI 1.715-13.955), body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 (OR = 0.110, 95% CI
0.0293-0.416), number of medications being taken (OR = 1.351, 95% CI
1.163-1.570), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR = 2.765, 95% CI 1.081-7.071) and MNA-SF 
≤ 11 (OR = 7.405, 95% CI 2.732-20.072). Frailty was associated with the
accumulation of risk factors. The prevalence of frailty in Japanese patients with
HD was relatively lower than that previously reported in Western developed
countries; however, it was extremely high compared to the general population
regardless of age. Our findings suggest that frailty might be associated with an 
increase in the prevalence of adverse health outcomes in patients with HD.

Depression and Physical Frailty Have Additive Effect on the Nutritional Status
and Clinical Outcome of Chinese Peritoneal Dialysis.

Szeto CC, Chan GC, Ng JK, Chow KM, Kwan BC, Cheng PM, Kwong VW, Law MC, Leung CB,
Li PK.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Frailty and depression both contribute to malnutrition and
adverse clinical outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, their
interaction is incompletely defined.
METHODS: We studied 178 adult Chinese PD patients. Physical frailty was assessed 
by a validated in-house questionnaire; depressive symptoms was screened by the
Geriatric Depression Scale; nutritional status was determined by subjective
global assessment (SGA) and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS). All patients
were followed for up to 24 months for survival and hospitalization analysis.
RESULTS: There were 111 patients (62.4%) physically frail, amongst those 48
(43.2%) had depressive symptoms. Only 1 patient had depressive symptoms without
frailty. There was an additive effect of depressive symptoms and physical frailty
on nutritional status. For the groups with no frailty, frail but no depressive
symptoms, and frail with depressive symptoms, serum albumin decreased in a
stepwise manner (35.8 ± 5.6, 34.9 ± 4.4, and 32.9 ± 5.3 g/L, respectively,
p=0.025); overall SGA score was 5.75 ± 0.61, 5.41 ± 0.59, and 5.04 ± 0.77,
respectively (p< 0.0001), and MIS was 5.12 ± 2.30, 7.13 ± 3.22, and 9.48 ± 3.97, 
respectively (p< 0.0001). At 24 months, patient survival was 86.6%, 71.4%, and
62.5% for patients with no frailty, frail but no depressive symptoms, and frail
with depressive symptoms, respective (p=0.001). The median number of hospital
stay was 8.04 (inter-quartile range [IQR] 0.91 - 19.42), 14.05 (IQR 3.57 -
37.27), and 26.62 (IQR 10.65 - 61.18) days per year of follow up, respectively
(p< 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Physical frailty and depressive symptoms are both common in Chinese
PD patients, and they have additive adverse effect on the nutritional status and 
clinical outcome.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cognitive and renal impairment are pervasive among elderly
frails, a high-risk, geriatric sub-population with peculiar clinical
characteristics. In a series of frail individuals with non-advanced chronic
kidney disease (CKD), we aimed at assessing the entity of functional, general
health and cognitive impairment and the possible relationship between these types
of dysfunction and the severity of renal impairment.
METHODS: 2229 geriatric subjects were screened for frailty and CKD. Severity of
CKD was assessed by eGFR (CKD-EPI formula). Frailty was established by the Fried 
Index. Functional, general health and cognitive status were assessed by validated
score measures.
RESULTS: Final analysis included 271 frail CKD subjects (162 women, 109 men).
Mean eGFR was 64.25 ± 25.04 mL/min/1.73 m2. Prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD
(stage 3-4) was 44%. Twenty-six percent of patients had severe cognitive
impairment, while mild and moderate impairment was found in 7 and 67% of
individuals, respectively. All subjects had poor functional and general health
status. Cognitive capacities significantly decreased across CKD stages (p for
trend < 0.0001). In fully adjusted multivariate analyses, cognitive status
remained an independent predictor of eGFR (β = 0.465; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Mild-to-moderate CKD is highly pervasive among frail elderly
individuals and the severity of renal dysfunction is independently correlated
with that of cognitive impairment. Future studies are advocated to clarify
whether the combination of kidney and mental dysfunction may portend a higher
risk of worsen outcomes in this high-risk population.

Background: Frail obese community-dwelling older adults are at increased
mortality risk. Among hemodialysis (HD) patients, frailty is common and
associated with increased mortality risk; however, in dialysis, obesity is
associated with decreased mortality risk. Whether the frail-obese phenotype is
associated with increased mortality risk among HD patients remains unclear.
Methods: This study included 370 incident HD patients enrolled in the Predictors 
of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in End Stage Renal Disease (PACE) study. We
measured frailty using the Fried phenotype, general obesity [body mass index
(BMI) ≥30 kg/m2] and abdominal obesity [waist:hip ratio (WHR) ≥median WHR] and
estimated their associations with mortality.
Results: The mean age was 55 years, with 42% female, 73% African American, 57%
diabetic and 52% frail. Frail HD patients had higher mean BMI
(frail = 30.3 kg/m2, non-frail = 28.3 kg/m2; P = 0.02) and similar WHR (P = 0.8).
Twenty-two percent were frail with general obesity and 27% were frail with
abdominal obesity. Frailty was associated with 1.66-fold increased mortality risk
[95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.67]. BMI was associated with a decreased
mortality risk [25.0-29.9 kg/m2 hazard ratio (HR) 0.53 (95% CI 0.31-0.93);
≥30 kg/m2 HR 0.34 (95% CI 0.19-0.62)]. Frailty was associated with elevated
mortality risk among HD patients with general [HR 3.77 (95% CI 1.10-12.92)] and
abdominal obesity [HR 2.38 (95% CI 1.17-4.82)]. Frailty was not associated with
mortality among HD patients without general or abdominal obesity.
Conclusions: In adults initiating HD, frailty was associated with elevated
mortality risk, even among the obese. Frail-obese HD patients may be a high-risk,
often-overlooked population, as obesity is assumed to be protective. Measurement 
of frailty and obesity may facilitate risk stratification.

Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo," and Department of

Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is the most common form of amyloidosis involving the
kidney. It is characterized by albuminuria, progressing to overt nephrotic
syndrome and eventually end-stage renal failure if diagnosed late or
ineffectively treated, and in most cases by concomitant heart involvement.
Cardiac amyloidosis is the main determinant of survival, whereas the risk of
dialysis is predicted by baseline proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate, and
by response to therapy. The backbone of treatment is chemotherapy targeting the
underlying plasma cell clone, that needs to be risk-adapted due to the frailty of
patients with AL amyloidosis who have cardiac and/or multiorgan involvement.
Low-risk patients (∼20%) can be considered for autologous stem cell
transplantation that can be preceded by induction and/or followed by
consolidation with bortezomib-based regimens. Bortezomib combined with
alkylators, such as melphalan, preferred in patients harboring t(11;14), or
cyclophosphamide, is used in most intermediate-risk patients, and with cautious
dose escalation in high-risk subjects. Novel, powerful anti-plasma cell agents,
such as pomalidomide, ixazomib, and daratumumab, prove effective in the
relapsed/refractory setting, and are being moved to upfront therapy in clinical
trials. Novel approaches based on small molecules interfering with the
amyloidogenic process and on antibodies targeting the amyloid deposits gave
promising results in preliminary uncontrolled studies, are being tested in
controlled trials, and will likely prove powerful complements to chemotherapy.
Finally, improvements in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of organ
damage are unveiling novel potential treatment targets, moving toward a cure for 
this dreadful disease.

Purpose: Recent evidence supports the prognostic significance of frailty for
functional decline and poor health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney
disease. Yet, despite the development of clinical tools to screen for frailty,
little is known about the experiential impact of screening for frailty in this
setting. The Frailty Assessment for Care Planning Tool (FACT) evaluates frailty
across 4 domains: mobility, function, social circumstances, and cognition. The
purpose of this qualitative study was as follows: 1) explore the nurse experience
of screening for frailty using the FACT tool in a specialized outpatient renal
clinic; 2) determine how, if at all, provider perceptions of frailty changed
after implementation of the frailty screening tool; and 3) determine the
perceived factors that influence uptake and administration of the FACT screening 
tool in a specialized clinical setting.
Methods: A semi-structured interview of 5 nurses from the Nova Scotia Health
Authority, Central Zone Renal Clinic was conducted. A grounded theory approach
was used to generate thematic categories and analysis models.
Results: Four primary themes emerged in the data analysis: "we were skeptical",
"we made it work", "we learned how", and "we understand". As the renal nurses
gained a sense of confidence in their ability to implement the FACT tool, initial
barriers to implementation were attenuated. Implementation factors - such as
realistic goals, clear guidelines, and ongoing training - were important factors 
for successful uptake of the frailty screening initiative.
Conclusion: Nurse participants reported an overall positive experience using the 
FACT method to screen for frailty and indicated that their understanding of the
multiple dimensions and subtleties of "frailty" were enhanced. Future nurse-led
FACT screening initiatives should incorporate those factors identified as being
integral to program success: realistic goals, clear guidelines, and ongoing
training. Adopting the evaluation of frailty as a priority within clinical
departments will encourage sustainability.

Frailty is a syndrome that includes broad problems of senility and consists of
three domains: physical, psychological, and social. Kampo medicine is used for
intervention in cases of hypofunction in a mental or physical state. Kampo
treatment, using Hojin formulations such as Hachimijiogan and Gosyajinkigan, is
useful in patients with "jinkyo," or kidney hypofunction. Ketsu includes both
blood and its metabolic products that circulate throughout the body. Oketsu is a 
disturbance of ketsu and is considered to be a microcirculation disorder.
Anti-oketsu formulations, such as Keishibukuryogan and Jidabokuippo, are useful
in the treatment of trauma patients who are experiencing swelling and pain. "Ki" 
is the universal energy that exists in the world. Hoki formulations, such as
Rikkunshito and Hochuekkito, are useful in patients with poor appetites for
reinforcing vital energy. Juzentaihoto and Ninjinyoeito are useful in patients
with hypofunction of ki and ketsu, which are accompanying symptoms of coldness or
cutaneous dryness. Thus, Kampo medicines can be used as a superior approach for
the management of frailty.

BACKGROUND: Symptomatic aortic stenosis has a poor prognosis. Many patients are
considered inoperable or at high surgical risk for surgical aortic valve
replacement (SAVR), reflecting their age, comorbidities and frailty. The clinical
effectiveness and safety of TAVI have not been reviewed systematically for these 
high levels of surgical risk. This systematic review compares mortality and other
important clinical outcomes up to 5 years post treatment following TAVI or other 
treatment in these risk groups.
METHODS: A systematic review protocol was registered on the PROSPERO database
(CRD42016048396). The Cochrane Library, Centre for Reviews and Dissemination
Databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ZETOC were searched from January 2002 to August
2016. Clinical trials or matched studies comparing TAVI with other treatments for
AS in patients surgically inoperable or operable at a high risk were included.
Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by two reviewers. Data were
pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The main outcomes were all-cause
mortality, efficacy and major complications.
RESULTS: Three good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included.
Patients' mean age ranged from 83-85 years, around half were female and New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV ranged from 83.8% to 94.2%
with frequent comorbidities. In 358 surgically inoperable patients from one RCT, 
TAVI was superior to medical therapy for all-cause mortality at 1 year (hazard
ratio (HR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.92), 2 years (HR 0.50, 95%
CI 0.39-0.65), 3 years (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41to 0.68) and 5 years (HR 0.50, 95% CI
0.39-0.65), and NYHA class III or IV at 2 years (TAVI 16.8% (16/95), medical
therapy 57.5% (23/40), p<0.001), quality of life and re-hospitalisation. TAVI had
higher risks of major bleeding up to 1 year, of stroke up to 3 years (at one year
11.2% versus 5.5%, p = .06; HR at 2 years 2.79, 95% CI 1.25-6.22; HR at 3 years
2.81; 95% CI 1.26-6.26) and of major vascular complication at 3 years (HR 8.27,
95% CI 2.92-23.44). Using the GRADE tool, this evidence was considered to be of
moderate quality. In a meta-analysis including 1,494 high risk surgically
operable patients from two non-inferiority RCTs TAVI showed no significant
differences from SAVR in all-cause mortality at two years (HR 1.03, 95% CI
0.82-1.29) and up to 5 years (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.83-1.12). There were no
statistically significant differences in major vascular complications and
myocardial infarction at any time point, discrepant results for major bleeding on
variable definitions and no differences in stroke rate at any time point. Using
the GRADE tool, this evidence was considered of low quality.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic aortic stenosis can be lethal without intervention but
surgical resection is contraindicated for some patients and high risk for others.
We found that all-cause mortality up to 5 years of follow-up did not differ
significantly between TAVI and SAVR in patients surgically operable at a high
risk, but favoured TAVI over medical therapy in patients surgically inoperable.
TAVI is a viable life-extending treatment option in these surgical high risk
groups.

Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) are produced by several endogenous
and exogenous processes, and their negative effects are neutralized by
antioxidant defenses. Oxidative stress occurs from the imbalance between RONS
production and these antioxidant defenses. Aging is a process characterized by
the progressive loss of tissue and organ function. The oxidative stress theory of
aging is based on the hypothesis that age-associated functional losses are due to
the accumulation of RONS-induced damages. At the same time, oxidative stress is
involved in several age-related conditions (ie, cardiovascular diseases [CVDs],
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, neurodegenerative 
diseases, and cancer), including sarcopenia and frailty. Different types of
oxidative stress biomarkers have been identified and may provide important
information about the efficacy of the treatment, guiding the selection of the
most effective drugs/dose regimens for patients and, if particularly relevant
from a pathophysiological point of view, acting on a specific therapeutic target.
Given the important role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of many clinical
conditions and aging, antioxidant therapy could positively affect the natural
history of several diseases, but further investigation is needed to evaluate the 
real efficacy of these therapeutic interventions. The purpose of this paper is to
provide a review of literature on this complex topic of ever increasing interest.

Background: Abnormally high estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) are
associated with endothelial dysfunction and frailty. Previous studies have shown 
that low eGFR is associated with increased morbidity, but few reports address
high eGFR. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association of high eGFR 
with surgical outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal
malignancies.
Methods: We identified patients who underwent elective surgery for
gastrointestinal malignancies from 2005 to 2015 in the American College of
Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. We evaluated
associations of eGFR with surgical outcomes by Cox or logistic models with
restricted cubic spline functions, adjusting for case mix variables (i.e. age,
gender, race and diabetes).
Results: The median eGFR is 83 (interquartile range 67-96) mL/min/1.73 m2.
Thirty-day mortality was 1.9% (2555/136 896). There is a U-shaped relationship
between eGFR and 30-day mortality. The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence
intervals) for eGFRs of 30, 60, 105 and 120 mL/min/1.73 m2 (versus
90 mL/min/1.73 m2) are 1.73 (1.52-1.97), 1.00 (0.89-1.11), 1.42 (1.31-1.55) and
2.20 (1.79-2.70), respectively. Similar associations are shown for other surgical
outcomes, including return to the operating room and postoperative pneumonia.
Subgroup analyses show that eGFRs both higher and lower than the respective
medians are consistently associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes across
age, gender and race.
Conclusions: High and low eGFRs are associated with more adverse surgical
outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for gastrointestinal malignancies. The
eGFR associated with the lowest postoperative risk is approximately at the median
eGFR of a given population.

A low-protein diet (LPD) can be expected to retard renal function decline in
advanced stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), including diabetic kidney
disease (DKD), and is recommended in a clinical setting. Regarding the molecular 
mechanisms of an LPD against DKD, previous animal studies have shown that an LPD 
exerts reno-protection through mainly the improvement of glomerular
hyperfiltration/hypertension due to the reduction of intraglomerular pressure. On
the other hand, we have demonstrated that an LPD, particularly a very-LPD (VLPD),
improved tubulo-interstitial damage, inflammation and fibrosis, through the
restoration of autophagy via the reduction of a mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in type 2 diabetes and obesity animal models. Thus,
based on animal studies, a VLPD may show a more beneficial effect against
advanced DKD. Previous clinical reports have also shown that a VLPD, not a
moderate LPD, slows the progression of renal dysfunction in patients with chronic
glomerular nephritis. However, there is insufficient clinical data regarding the 
beneficial effects of a VLPD against DKD. Additionally, the patients with CKD,
including DKD, are a high-risk group for malnutrition, such as protein⁻energy
wasting (PEW), sarcopenia, and frailty. Therefore, an LPD, including a VLPD,
should be prescribed to patients when the benefits of an LPD outweigh the risks, 
upon consideration of adherence, age, and nutritional status. As the future
predicts, the development of a VLPD replacement therapy without malnutrition may 
be expected for reno-protection against the advanced stages of DKD, through the
regulation of mTORC1 activity and adequate autophagy induction. However, further 
studies to elucidate detailed mechanisms by which a VLPD exerts reno-protection
are necessary.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) is the culmination of chronic liver disease
and extrahepatic organ failures, which is associated with a high short-term
mortality and immense health care expenditure. There are varying definitions for 
organ failures and ACLF in Europe, North America, and Asia. These differing
definitions need to be reconciled to enhance progress in the field. The
pathogenesis of ACLF is multifactorial and related to interactions between the
immunoinflammatory system, microbiota, and the various precipitating factors.
Individual organ failures related to the kidney, brain, lungs, and circulation
have cumulative adverse effects on mortality and are often complicated or
precipitated by infections. Strategies to prevent and rapidly treat these organ
failures are paramount in improving survival. With the aging population and
paucity of organs for liver transplant, the prognosis of ACLF patients is poor,
highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. The role of liver
transplant in ACLF is evolving and needs further investigation across large
consortia. A role for early palliative care and management of frailty as
approaches to alleviate disease burden and improve patient-reported outcomes is
being increasingly recognized.CONCLUSION: ACLF is a clinically relevant syndrome 
that is epidemic worldwide and requires a dedicated multinational approach
focused on prognostication and management; investigations are underway worldwide 
to prepare ACLF for prime time. (Hepatology 2018; 00:000-000).

Background Frail kidney transplant (KT) recipients may be particularly vulnerable
to surgical stressors, resulting in delirium and subsequent adverse outcomes. We 
sought to identify the incidence, risk factors, and sequelae of post-KT
delirium.Methods We studied 125,304 adult KT recipients (1999-2014) to estimate
delirium incidence in national registry claims. Additionally, we used a validated
chart abstraction algorithm to identify post-KT delirium in 893 adult recipients 
(2009-2017) from a cohort study of frailty. Delirium sequelae were identified
using adjusted logistic regression (length of stay ≥2 weeks and institutional
discharge [skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility]) and adjusted Cox
regression (death-censored graft loss and mortality).Results Only 0.8% of KT
recipients had a delirium claim. In the cohort study, delirium incidence
increased with age (18-49 years old: 2.0%; 50-64 years old: 4.6%; 65-75 years
old: 9.2%; and ≥75 years old: 13.8%) and frailty (9.0% versus 3.9%); 20.0% of
frail recipients aged ≥75 years old experienced delirium. Frailty was
independently associated with delirium (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 4.13; P=0.04), but premorbid global cognitive function
was not. Recipients with delirium had increased risks of ≥2-week length of stay
(OR, 5.42; 95% CI, 2.76 to 10.66; P<0.001), institutional discharge (OR, 22.41;
95% CI, 7.85 to 63.98; P<0.001), graft loss (hazard ratio [HR], 2.73; 95% CI,
1.14 to 6.53; P=0.03), and mortality (HR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.76 to 5.54;
P<0.001).Conclusions Post-KT delirium is a strong risk factor for subsequent
adverse outcomes, yet it is a clinical entity that is often missed.

BACKGROUND: Among community-dwelling older adults, frailty is associated with
heightened markers of inflammation and subsequent mortality. Although frailty is 
common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, the role of frailty and
markers of inflammation in this population remains unclear. We quantified these
associations in patients on the kidney transplant waitlist and tested whether
frailty and/or markers of inflammation improve waitlist mortality risk
prediction.
METHODS: We studied 1975 ESRD patients on the kidney transplant waitlist
(November 1, 2009, to February 28, 2017) in a multi-center cohort study of
frailty. Serum inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 [IL-6], soluble tumor necrosis
factor-α receptor-1 [sTNFR1], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) were analyzed in 605 
of these participants; we calculated the inflammatory index score using IL-6 and 
sTNFR1. We compared the C-statistic of an established registry-based prediction
model for waitlist mortality adding frailty and/or inflammatory markers (1 SD
change in log IL-6, sTNFR1, CRP, or inflammatory index).
RESULTS: The registry-based model had moderate predictive ability (c-statistic = 
0.655). Frailty was associated with increased mortality (2.19; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.26-3.79) but did not improve risk prediction (c-statistic =
0.646; P = 0.65). Like frailty, IL-6 (2.13; 95% CI, 1.41-3.22), sTNFR1 (1.70; 95%
CI, 1.12-2.59), CRP (1.68; 95% CI, 1.06-2.67), and the inflammatory index (2.09; 
95% CI, 1.38-3.16) were associated with increased mortality risk; unlike frailty,
adding IL-6 (c-statistic = 0.777; P = 0.02), CRP (c-statistic = 0.728; P = 0.02),
or inflammatory index (c-statistic = 0.777; P = 0.02) substantially improved
mortality risk prediction.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty and markers of inflammation were associated with increased
waitlist mortality risk, but only markers of inflammation significantly improved 
ESRD risk prediction. These findings help clarify the accelerated aging
physiology of ESRD and highlight easy-to-measure markers of increased waitlist
mortality risk.

Frailty, the state of increased vulnerability to physical stressors as a result
of progressive and sustained degeneration in multiple physiological systems, is
common in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In fact, the prevalence of
frailty in the older adult population is reported to be 11%, whereas the
prevalence of frailty has been reported to be greater than 60% in
dialysis-dependent CKD patients. Frailty is independently linked with adverse
clinical outcomes in all stages of CKD and has been repeatedly shown to be
associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization. In recent
years there have been efforts to create an operationalized definition of frailty 
to aid its diagnosis and to categorize its severity. Two principal concepts are
described, namely the Fried Phenotype Model of Physical Frailty and the
Cumulative Deficit Model of Frailty. There is no agreement on which frailty
assessment approach is superior, therefore, for the time being, emphasis should
be placed on any efforts to identify frailty. Recognizing frailty should prompt a
holistic assessment of the patient to address risk factors that may exacerbate
its progression and to ensure that the patient has appropriate psychological and 
social support. Adequate nutritional intake is essential and individualized
exercise programmes should be offered. The acknowledgement of frailty should
prompt discussions that explore the future care wishes of these vulnerable
patients. With further study, nephrologists may be able to use frailty
assessments to inform discussions with patients about the initiation of renal
replacement therapy.

Before the percutaneous era, the mortality rate of patients with coronary heart
disease not suitable for cardiac surgery was extremely high. This limit has been 
progressively exceeded with the advent of minimally invasive approaches, which,
although initially intended exclusively for low risk scenarios, was then employed
in complex patients often too compromised to undergo cardiac surgery. We are
currently witnessing, however, a sudden expansion in percutaneous coronary
interventions (PCI) in extreme cases, perceived as high-risk by operators,
imposing an important burden of human and economic resources on interventional
cardiology as a whole. In this review, the literature regarding the current
definition of high-risk PCI and its implications has been reviewed. In summary,
all proposed definitions of high risk PCI combine features related to three main 
clinical areas: 1) patient risk factors and comorbidities (incorporating those
which preclude surgical or percutaneous revascularization such as diabetes,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, lung disease,
frailty, advanced age); 2) location of the disease and complexity of coronary
anatomy (including multi-vessel disease, left main disease, chronic total
occlusion, bifurcations); 3) hemodynamic clinical status (ventricular
dysfunction, concomitant valvular disease or unstable characteristics).
Importantly, encouraging results in terms of efficacy and gains in health status 
of PCI in (variously defined) high-risk, as compared to the low-risks patients,
are reported. Thus, treating high-risk patients is becoming increasingly
relevant, to the point that current guidelines now particularly highlight the
appropriateness of percutaneous interventions in this setting .

BACKGROUND: Frailty and acute kidney injury are independently associated with an 
increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The degree of frailty can be assessed 
by the Clinical Frailty Score (CFS). This study assessed whether an individual's 
CFS was associated with acute kidney injury in acute elderly medical admissions
and recorded the short-term outcomes.
METHODS: This was a single-center prospective observational cohort study. All
patients aged ≥65 years admitted under an acute medical take over 12
nonconsecutive days were included. Patient demographics, comorbidities, baseline 
CFS, and renal status on admission were recorded. Outcomes of death, length of
stay, and hospital re-attendance were assessed 2 weeks following admission.
RESULTS: Of 164 patients (77 males), 19% had acute kidney injury on admission and
22% were considered severely frail. Severe frailty was associated with acute
kidney injury (P = .01) and death within 2 weeks (P = .01). Two-week mortality
was highest among patients with both (36%).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of acute kidney injury in "severely frail" acutely
unwell elderly patients is significantly higher and associated with an increased 
short-term mortality. The CFS may be useful in acute illness to guide clinical
decisions in elderly patients.

Bacterial pathogens are the most frequent cause of pneumonia after
transplantation. Early after transplantation, recipients are at higher risk for
nosocomial infections. The most commonly encountered pathogens during this period
are gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa …), but gram-positive coccus such as Staphylococcus aureus or
Streptococcus pneumoniae and anaerobic bacteria can also be found. Empirical
antibiotic therapy should be guided by previous colonisation of the recipient and
bacterial resistance pattern in the hospital. Six months after transplantation,
pneumonias are mostly due to community-acquired bacteria (S. pneumonia, H.
influenza, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and others). Opportunistic pathogens take
advantage of the state of immunosuppression which is usually highest from one to 
six months after transplantation. During this period, but also occurring many
years later in the setting of a chronically depressed immune system, bacterial
pathogens with low intrinsic virulence can cause pneumonia. The diagnosis of
pneumonia caused by opportunistic pathogens can be challenging. The delay in
diagnosis preventing the early instauration of adequate treatment in kidney
transplant recipients with a depressed immune system, frequently coupled with
co-morbid conditions and a state of frailty, will affect prognosis and outcome,
increasing morbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the most common
opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in kidney transplant
recipients: Legionella, Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis/nontuberculous, and 
Rhodococcus. Recognition of their specificities in the setting of
immunosuppression will allow early diagnosis, crucial for initiation of effective
therapy and successful outcome. Interactions with immunosuppressive therapy
should be considered as well as reducing immunosuppression if necessary.

OBJECTIVE: To determine predictors of serious adverse events (SAEs) involving
syncope, hypotension, and falls, with particular attention to age, in the
Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial.
DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial.
SETTING: Academic and private practices across the United States (N = 102).
PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 50 and older with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of
130 to 180 mmHg at high risk of cardiovascular disease events, but without
diabetes, history of stroke, symptomatic heart failure or ejection fraction less 
than 35%, dementia, or standing SBP less than 110 mmHg (N = 9,361).
INTERVENTION: Treatment of SBP to a goal of less than 120 mmHg or 140 mmHg.
MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were SAEs involving syncope, hypotension, and falls.
Predictors were treatment assignment, demographic characteristics, comorbidities,
baseline measurements, and baseline use of cardiovascular medications.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two (1.8%) participants had SAEs involving syncope, 
155 (1.6%) hypotension, and 203 (2.2%) falls. Randomization to intensive SBP
control was associated with greater risk of an SAE involving hypotension (hazard 
ratio (HR) = 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-2.32, P = .002), and
possibly syncope (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.98-1.79, P = .07), but not falls
(HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.75-1.29, P = .90). Risk of all three outcomes was higher
for participants with chronic kidney disease or frailty. Older age was also
associated with greater risk of syncope, hypotension, and falls, but there was no
age-by-treatment interaction for any of the SAE outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Participants randomized to intensive SBP control had greater risk of
hypotension and possibly syncope, but not falls. The greater risk of developing
these events associated with intensive treatment did not vary according to age.

Many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease have 
unmet palliative care (PC) needs. Physical and emotional symptoms are common.
Some, like uremia and fluid overload, improve with dialysis, but the increasing
age of patients initiating renal replacement therapy leaves many untreatable
comorbidities like dementia and frailty to negatively impact quality of life.
Written by nephrologists and PC clinicians, this article will help PC providers
to have a richer understanding of kidney disease-related symptom burden, disease 
trajectory, prognosis, and barriers to hospice enrollment for patients with CKD
and end-stage renal disease.

Background: Recent studies in adults have found an incidence of acute kidney
injury (AKI) in patients treated with a combination of vancomycin and
piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) that is greater than that expected with either
medication alone. The purpose of this study was to determine whether combination 
therapy with vancomycin and TZP is associated with an incidence of AKI in
pediatric patients higher than that in those on combination therapy with
vancomycin and cefepime.
Methods: We performed a retrospective single-center matched-cohort study of
pediatric patients who received vancomycin in combination with TZP or cefepime
between January 2015 and June 2016. The patients were matched according to
chronic disease, age, sex, and number of concomitant nephrotoxic medications at
the time of combination antibiotic therapy. The primary outcome was incidence of 
AKI. Secondary outcomes included differences between groups in time to AKI,
resolution of AKI, and effect of vancomycin trough levels on the incidence of
nephrotoxicity. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare categorical
and continuous variables between treatment groups. Conditional Poisson regression
was used to assess the association between AKI and treatment groups. Stratified
log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models with shared frailty were used 
to compare the times to AKI according to treatment group.
Results: Two hundred twenty-eight matched patients were included. AKI developed
in 9 (7.9%) of 114 and 33 (28.9%) of 114 patients in the cefepime and TZP groups,
respectively (P < .001). Type of combination therapy remained a significant
predictor for AKI in multivariate conditional Poisson analysis in which
adjustments were made for age, sex, use of concomitant nephrotoxins, and
vancomycin dose (relative risk, 2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.8]; P = .03).
AKI developed almost 3 times sooner in the TZP group than in the cefepime group
(hazard ratio, 2.9 [95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.1]; P = .006). Sensitivity
analyses in which adjustment was made for antibiotic indication in addition to
the aforementioned variables and excluding those with gastrointestinal infection 
revealed similar results.
Conclusion: Among hospitalized children at our institution, combination therapy
with vancomycin and TZP was associated with an incidence of AKI higher than that 
associated with vancomycin and cefepime.

Despite the advances in dialysis technology over the past decades, patients with 
advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high symptom burden, shortened
survival and substantial physical, emotional and spiritual suffering. Number of
frailty patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is growing and for many of 
them the beginning or continuation of dialysis is associated with a high risk of 
short-term mortality or worsening of functional status. Identifying these fragile
patients and integrating palliative care into standard nephrological care
improves patients quality of life and has the potential to prolong their lives
without demanding dialysis treatment. Nephrologists basic skills should include: 
estimating the prognosis, communication with the patient on advance care planning
including end-of-life issues and consistent symptom management. In fragile
patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, the disease-oriented model with
quantitative targets is no longer an adequate approach to care.

The number of elderly people has increased considerably over the last decades,
due to a rising life expectancy and ageing populations. As a result, an increased
number of elderly with end-stage-renal-disease are diagnosed, for which the
preferred treatment is renal transplantation. Over the past years the awareness
of the elderly as a specific patient population has grown, which increases the
importance of research in this group. Elderly patients often receive kidneys from
elderly donors while younger donor kidneys are preferentially reserved for
younger recipients. Although the rate of acute rejection after transplantation is
lower in the elderly, these rejections may lead to graft loss more frequently, as
kidneys from elderly donors have marginal reserve capacity. To prevent acute
rejection, immunosuppressive therapy is needed. On the other hand, elderly
patients have a higher risk to die from infectious complications, and thus less
immunosuppression would be preferable. Immunosuppressive treatment in the elderly
is complicated further by changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,
with increasing age. Adjustments in standard immunosuppressive regimes are
therefore suggested for this population. An unmet need in transplantation
medicine is a tool to guide a personalized approach to immunosuppression.
Recently several promising biomarkers that identify injury to the graft at an
early stage or predict acute rejection have been identified. Unfortunately, none 
of these biomarkers were tested specifically in the elderly. We believe there is 
an urgent need to perform clinical trials investigating novel immunosuppressive
regimens in conjunction with biomarker studies in this specific population.

Background: Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have low levels of
physical activity and physical function. Although guidelines endorse exercise
counseling for individuals with CKD, it is not yet part of routine care.
Objective: We investigated the effect of attending a real-life exercise
counseling clinic (ECC) on physical function in individuals with CKD.
Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected observational data with
quasi-experimental design.
Setting and Participants: Patients with all stages of CKD registered in a large
provincial renal program were eligible. The exposed cohort who attended the ECC
between January 1, 2011, and March 15, 2014, included 214 individuals. The
control cohort included 292 individuals enrolled in an observational study
investigating longitudinal change in frailty during the same time period.
Predictor/Factor: Attendance at an ECC.
Outcomes and Measurements: Change in physical function as measured by Short
Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score, physical activity level (Human
Activity Profile [HAP]/Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly [PASE]), and
health-related quality of life (HRQOL; EQ5D/VAS) over 1 year.
Results: Eighty-seven individuals in the ECC cohort and 125 participants in the
control cohort completed 1-year follow-up. Baseline median SPPB score was 10
(interquartile range [IQR]: 9-12) and 9 (IQR: 7-11) in the ECC and control
cohorts, respectively (P < .01). At 1 year, SPPB scores were 10 (IQR: 8-12) and 9
(IQR: 6-11) in the ECC and control cohorts, respectively (P = .04). Mean change
in SPPB over 1 year was not significantly different between groups: -0.33 (95%
confidence interval [CI]: -0.81 to 0.15) in ECC and -0.22 (95% CI: -0.61 to 0.17)
in control (P = .72). There was no significant difference in the proportion of
individuals in each cohort with an increase/decrease in SPPB score over time.
There was no significant change in physical activity or HRQOL over time between
groups.
Limitations: Quasi-experimental design, low rate of follow-up attendance.
Conclusions: In this pragmatic study, exercise counseling had no significant
effect on change in SPPB score, suggesting that a single exercise counseling
session alone is inadequate to improve physical function in CKD.

contrôle ont complété le suivi. Les médianes initiales au test SPPB étaient de 10
(EI: 9-12) et de 9 (EI: 7-11) respectivement (p < 0,01). Après un an, les scores 
au test SPPB étaient pratiquement inchangés: médiane de 10 (EI: 8-12) pour la
cohorte exposée et de 9 pour la cohorte contrôle (EI: 6-11) (p = 0,04). Pendant
l’année du suivi, la variation moyenne du score au test SPPB a été semblable dans
les deux groupes: −0,33 (IC 95 % −0,81 à 0,15) dans la cohorte exposée et −0,22
(IC 95 % −0,61 à 0,17) dans le groupe contrôle (p = 0,72). Au fil du temps, la
proportion d’individus ayant présenté une diminution ou une augmentation du score
au test SPPB était similaire dans les deux groupes; et aucun changement
significatif dans le niveau d’activité physique ou la qualité de vie relative à
l’état de santé n’avait été observé entre les groupes.Les résultats sont limités 
par le modèle quasi expérimental de l’étude et la faible participation au suivi
sur un an.Cette étude pragmatique démontre que le fait de consulter pour un
programme d’entraînement n’a que peu d’effet sur le score obtenu au test SPPB.
Cette observation suggère qu’une seule séance de consultation en vue d’adopter un
programme d’entraînement n’est pas suffisante pour améliorer la condition
physique des patients atteints d’IRC.

BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an increasingly
common treatment of symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis (AS). Thus, it is
reasonable to carefully investigate the impact of individual clinical factors on 
outcomes after TAVI.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the impact of the previous cerebro-vascular
events (CVEs) on outcomes of patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: A total of 148 consecutive patients scheduled for TAVI were included and
stratified as with and without a history of CVEs (stroke or transient ischemic
attack). Frailty features were also assessed. The primary endpoint was a 12-month
all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Seventeen (11.5%) patients had a history of CVEs (the CVE group). At 30 
days and 12 months, all-cause mortality was higher in the CVE group [30-day: 5
(29.4%) vs. 7 (5.3%); p=0.005; 12-month: 9 (52.9%) vs. 13 (9.9%); p=0.001].
Similarly, at the longest available follow-up, mortality was higher in the CVE
group [10 (58.8%) vs. 23 (17.6%); p=0.001]. Similar rates of other complications 
after TAVI were noted, apart from inhospital acute kidney injury (AKI) grade 3 [3
(17.6%) vs. 5 (3.8%); p=0.049] and blood transfusions [9 (52.9%) vs. 35 (26.7%); 
p=0.026]. Results of 5MWT and Katz index assessment indicated a greater level of 
frailty in the CVE group. There were no differences in subsequent events
including CVEs, bleeding, myocardial infarction, and new-onset of atrial
fibrillation (AF) at 12 months between the groups.
CONCLUSION: We showed that a history of CVEs in patients with severe AS
undergoing TAVI is associated with a higher long-term mortality.

The relationship between frailty and chronic kidney disease in elderly population
has been recognized; however, studies concentrating on frailty in predialysis
patients are limited. For nephrologists, the recognition of frailty is important 
as it has impact on decisions on the choice of dialysis modality and sometimes on
whether dialysis is indeed in the patients' best interests. Many of the tools for
routine assessment of frailty are not easily applicable to those clinicians not
practicing elderly care medicine. A tool needs to be simple and applicable for
daily routine practice. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and
clinical outcome of frailty in an elderly predialysis population using simple
tools. A nonrandomized prospective study was conducted in which, 104 patients
aged 65 years or above with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 25 mL or
less were included. Data including age, sex, renal function, calcium, albumin,
parathormone, and comorbidities were collected at baseline and at three months
interval for one year. Functional performance was assessed using Karnofsky scale.
The Charlson comorbidity index was used to assess comorbid status of each
patient. Frailty was assessed using a combination of PRISMA questionnaire and
Timed up and Go test. End points were death or start of dialysis at 20-month
follow-up. A frail group (n = 58; males = 32, females = 26) and a nonfrail group 
(n = 46; males = 21, females = 25) were identified. Frailty was prevalent in
53.8% of the selected population. There was no significant difference between
both groups in terms of age, gender, comorbidities, hemoglobin, inflammatory
markers, or calcium hemostasis. Nine patients chose conservative management in
the frail group and six in nonfrail group. Rate of death was significantly higher
in the frail group (death = 14) compared to nonfrail group (death = 3; P = 0.01).
There was no significant difference between both groups in terms of initiation of
dialysis (P = 0.1). Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index were significantly
associated with mortality (P = 0.023 and 0.032, respectively). Survival in frail 
patients who started peritoneal dialysis (PD) was slightly better than those
started on hemodialysis (HD) with hazard ratio = 3.23 (P = 0.23). Our study shows
that the prevalence of frailty and mortality rate is high among elderly
predialysis patients. Frailty and Charlson comorbidity index are independent
predictors of outcome in this population. PD might be a better option of dialysis
modality compared to HD in the frail population.

Owing to the worldwide increase in life expectancy, the high incidence of
diabetes in older individuals and the improved survival of people with diabetes, 
about one-third of all individuals with diabetes are now older than 65 years.
Evidence is accumulating that type 2 diabetes is associated with cognitive
impairment, dementia and frailty. Older people with diabetes have significantly
more comorbidities, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial
disease and renal impairment, compared with those without diabetes. However, as a
consequence of the increased use of multifactorial risk factor intervention, a
considerable number of older individuals can now survive for many years without
any vascular complications. Given the heterogeneity of older individuals with
type 2 diabetes, an individualised approach is warranted, which must take into
account the health status, presence or absence of complications, and life
expectancy. In doing so, undertreatment of otherwise healthy older individuals
and overtreatment of those who are frail may be avoided. Specifically,
overtreatment of hyperglycaemia in older patients is potentially harmful; in
particular, insulin and sulfonylureas should be avoided or, if necessary, used
with caution. Instead, glucose-dependent drugs that do not induce hypoglycaemia
are preferable since older patients with diabetes and impaired kidney function
are especially vulnerable to this adverse event.

Objectives The clinical condition of frailty is a common problem in the elderly
population. However, the relationship between peripheral artery disease and
frailty in hemodialysis patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to
identify the relationships between peripheral artery disease and frailty in
Japanese chronic hemodialysis patients. Methods A total of 362 chronic
hemodialysis patients who regularly visited six institutions were enrolled. To
evaluate frailty, the modified Fried's frailty phenotype adjusted for Japanese
were used. Peripheral artery disease was defined as ankle-brachial index <0.9.
Results Of 362 patients, 62 patients (17.1%) were categorized as peripheral
artery disease group and 300 patients (82.9%) as Non-peripheral artery disease
group. The prevalence of frailty in the peripheral artery disease group was
significantly higher than in the Non-peripheral artery disease group (34% vs.
18%, P = 0.0103). Non-shunt side grip strength was significantly stronger in the 
Non-peripheral artery disease group (23.6 kg vs. 17.0 kg, P < 0.0001). Thigh
circumferences were also significantly larger in the Non-peripheral artery
disease group (41.7 cm vs. 39.7 cm, P = 0.0054). A multivariate logistic
regression analysis demonstrated that the factors independently associated with
peripheral artery disease were as follows: frailty (odds ratio = 2.06, 95%
confidence interval 1.09-3.89) and myocardial infarction (odds ratio = 3.74, 95% 
confidence interval 2.05-6.83). Conclusions It is concluded that peripheral
artery disease is closely associated with frailty in hemodialysis patients.

Hypertension is both a health problem and a financial one globally. It affects
nearly 30 % of the general population. Elderly people, aged ≥65 years, are a
special group of hypertensive patients. In this group, the overall prevalence of 
the disease reaches 60 %, rising to 70 % in those aged ≥80 years. In the elderly 
population, isolated systolic hypertension is quite common. High systolic blood
pressure is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, cognitive impairment and
kidney disease. Considering the physiological changes resulting from ageing
alongside multiple comorbidities, treatment of hypertension in elderly patients
poses a significant challenge to treatment teams. Progressive disability with
regard to the activities of daily life, more frequent hospitalisations and low
quality of life are often seen in elderly patients. There is discussion in the
literature regarding frailty syndrome associated with old age. Frailty is
understood to involve decreased resistance to stressors, depleted adaptive and
physiological reserves of a number of organs, endocrine dysregulation and immune 
dysfunction. The primary dilemma concerning frailty is whether it should only be 
defined on the basis of physical factors, or whether psychological and social
factors should also be included. Proper nutrition and motor rehabilitation should
be prioritised in care for frail patients. The risk of orthostatic hypotension is
a significant issue in elderly patients. It results from an autonomic nervous
system dysfunction and involves maladjustment of the cardiovascular system to
sudden changes in the position of the body. Other significant issues in elderly
patients include polypharmacy, increased risk of falls and cognitive impairment. 
Chronic diseases, including hypertension, deteriorate baroreceptor function and
result in irreversible changes in cerebral and coronary circulation. Concurrent
frailty or other components of geriatric syndrome in elderly patients are
associated with a worse perception of health, an increased number of
comorbidities and social isolation of the patient. It may also interfere with
treatment adherence. Identifying causes of non-adherence to pharmaceutical
treatment is a key factor in planning therapeutic interventions aimed at
increasing control, preventing complications, and improving long-term outcomes
and any adverse effects of treatment. Diagnosis of frailty and awareness of the
associated difficulties in adhering to treatment may allow targeting of those
elderly patients who have a poorer prognosis or may be at risk of complications
from untreated or undertreated hypertension, and for the planning of
interventions to improve hypertension control.

OBJECTIVES: Acute kidney injury frequently complicates critical illness and is
associated with high morbidity and mortality. Frailty is common in critical
illness survivors, but little is known about the impact of acute kidney injury.
We examined the association of acute kidney injury and frailty within a year of
hospital discharge in survivors of critical illness.
DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Medical/surgical ICU of a U.S. tertiary care medical center.
PATIENTS: Three hundred seventeen participants with respiratory failure and/or
shock.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Acute kidney injury was determined using Kidney
Disease Improving Global Outcomes stages. Clinical frailty status was determined 
using the Clinical Frailty Scale at 3 and 12 months following discharge.
Covariates included mean ICU Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score as well as baseline comorbidity
(i.e., Charlson Comorbidity Index), kidney function, and Clinical Frailty Scale
score. Of 317 patients, 243 (77%) had acute kidney injury and one in four
patients with acute kidney injury was frail at baseline. In adjusted models,
acute kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 were associated with higher frailty scores
at 3 months (odds ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.14-3.24; odds ratio, 2.40; 95% CI,
1.31-4.42; and odds ratio, 4.41; 95% CI, 2.20-8.82, respectively). At 12 months, 
a similar association of acute kidney injury stages 1, 2, and 3 and higher
Clinical Frailty Scale score was noted (odds ratio, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.11-3.14; odds
ratio, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.94-3.48; and odds ratio, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.34-5.66,
respectively). In supplemental and sensitivity analyses, analogous patterns of
association were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury in survivors of critical illness predicted worse
frailty status 3 and 12 months postdischarge. These findings have important
implications on clinical decision making among acute kidney injury survivors and 
underscore the need to understand the drivers of frailty to improve
patient-centered outcomes.

Frailty is significantly associated with bone loss in the general population.
However, it is unclear whether this association also exists in patients
undergoing hemodialysis who have chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder
(CKD-MBD). This study aimed to assess the association between frailty and bone
loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis. This cross-sectional study included 214
(90 women, 124 men) Japanese outpatients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis
three times per week, with a mean age of 67.1 years (women) and 66.8 years (men).
Frailty was defined based on criteria set forth by the Cardiovascular Health
Study (CHS)-19 (21.1%) women and 47 (37.9%) men were robust, 41 (45.6%) women and
43 (34.7%) men were pre-frail, and 30 (33.3%) women and 34 (27.4%) men were
frail. For bone mass, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parameters (speed of sound,
broadband ultrasound attenuation, stiffness index) of the calcaneus were
measured. The association between frailty and QUS parameters was determined
separately for women and men using multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), 
with adjustments for clinical characteristics including age, body mass index,
hemodialysis vintage, diabetes, current smoking, serum albumin, phosphate,
corrected calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, and medication for CKD-MBD
(vitamin D receptor activator, calcimimetics). ANCOVA revealed that all QUS
parameters declined significantly with increasing levels of frailty in both sexes
(P < 0.05). In conclusion, frailty (as defined by CHS criteria) should be
considered a risk factor for bone loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

BACKGROUND: The Fried frailty phenotype, a measure of physiologic reserve defined
by 5 components (exhaustion, unintentional weight loss, low physical activity,
slow walking speed, and poor grip strength), is associated with poor outcomes
among ESRD patients. However, these 5 components may not fully capture
physiologic reserve in this population. We aimed to ascertain opinions of ESRD
clinicians and patients about the usefulness of the Fried frailty phenotype and
interventions to improve frailty in ESRD patients, and to identify novel
components to further characterize frailty in ESRD.
METHODS: Clinicians who treat adults with ESRD completed a 2-round Delphi study
(n = 41 and n = 36, respectively; response rate = 87%). ESRD patients completed a
survey at transplant evaluation (n = 460; response rate = 81%). We compared
clinician and patient opinions on the constituent components of frailty.
RESULTS: Clinicians were more likely than patients to say that ESRD makes
patients frail (97.6% vs. 60.2%). There was consensus among clinicians that
exhaustion, low physical activity, slow walking speed, and poor grip strength
characterize frailty in ESRD patients; however, 29% of clinicians thought weight 
loss was not relevant. Patients were less likely than clinicians to say that the 
5 Fried frailty components were relevant. Clinicians identified 10 new
ESRD-specific potential components including falls (64%), physical decline (61%),
and cognitive impairment (39%). Clinicians (83%) and patients (80%) agreed that
intradialytic foot-peddlers might make ESRD patients less frail.
CONCLUSIONS: There was consensus among clinicians and moderate consensus among
patients that frailty is more common in ESRD. Weight loss was not seen as
relevant, but new components were identified. These findings are first steps in
refining the frailty phenotype and identifying interventions to improve
physiologic reserve specific to ESRD patients.

AIMS: Hypoglycaemia represents a critical burden with clinical and social
consequences in the management of diabetes. Serum uric acid (SUA) has been
associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), but no conclusive findings are
available nowadays in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia. We investigated
whether SUA levels at the time of hypoglycaemia could predict all-cause mortality
after 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: In total, 219 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of
Ospedale Policlinico S. Martino of Genoa (Italy) have been enrolled between
January 2011 and December 2014. The primary endpoint of the study consisted in
determining whether SUA levels at the time of ED admission could predict the
occurrence of death after 1 year.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were diabetic, especially type 2. CVD and
chronic kidney disease were prevalent comorbidities. By a cut-off value obtained 
by the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, a Kaplan-Meier analysis 
demonstrated that patients with SUA levels > 5.43 mg/dL were more prone to death 
after 1 year compared to those with lower SUA levels. The risk of death increased
with high SUA levels both in the univariate and the multivariate models including
estimated glomerular filtration rate, C-reactive protein, type of diabetes, and
age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index.
CONCLUSIONS: SUA could be useful as a predictor of 1-year mortality in
hypoglycaemic patients, irrespective of severe comorbidities notably increasing
the risk of death in these frail patients.

Background: Frailty can be defined as an inflammatory state with a loss of
physiologic reserve in multiple systems that manifests as a decreased ability to 
respond to stressors that ultimately leads to an increased risk of adverse
outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the ease of frailty testing in a
pre-kidney transplant clinic and the resources required to do so. A secondary
goal was to better understand the utility of frailty testing when evaluating
potential kidney transplant recipients.
Methods: Frailty testing was conducted at a pre-kidney transplant clinic in three
phases using Fried's frailty phenotype (shrinking, exhaustion, low physical
activity, slowness, and grip strength).
Results: A total of 132 frailty tests were completed on 128 patients. Frail
patients had significantly higher rates of shrinking (26% vs. 8.5%, P < 0.05),
exhaustion (82.6% vs. 27.6%, P < 0.05), low physical activity (78.2% vs. 19.0%, P
< 0.05), slow walking (60.8% vs. 15.2%, P < 0.05), and grip strength (73.9% vs.
25.7%, P < 0.05). When comparing the listing of frail and non-frail patients for 
transplant, a significantly lower proportion of frail patients were listed
compared to non-frail patients (30.4% vs. 57.6%, P < 0.05). Frailty testing was
most complete when an examiner dedicated to frailty testing performed the
testing.
Conclusions: Frailty testing is feasible to complete in a pre-transplant clinic
with an appropriate investment in personnel and resources.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sarcopenia and muscle weakness contribute to fragility and
limit exercise tolerance among patients with CKD. This review focuses on the role
of reduction in mitochondrial mass and function in the myopathy associated with
CKD, causes for these muscle mitochondrial abnormalities, and potential
therapeutic interventions that may improve mitochondrial biogenesis and function 
as well as skeletal muscle function and performance in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial structure, function, and
composition have been shown in both experimental models and patients with CKD. A 
significant reduction in mitochondrial respiratory function and an increase in
mitochondrial complex 1 enzyme activity has been demonstrated in the muscle
tissue of male Sprague-Dawley rats following 5/6 nephrectomy. These changes were 
associated with a substantial reduction in skeletal muscle mitochondrial mass. In
patients with CKD, in-vivo magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy show
significantly elevated resting skeletal muscle oxygen consumption and lower mean 
mitochondrial coupling ratio indicating disrupted muscle mitochondrial metabolism
and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Skeletal muscle biopsies from
patients with advanced CKD show lower mitochondrial volume density and
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number than controls.
SUMMARY: Advanced CKD is associated with decreased exercise capacity, skeletal
muscle weakness, and muscle atrophy. Impaired mitochondrial respiratory function,
reduced muscle mitochondrial mass, and decreased energy production in skeletal
muscle play a critical role in this 'acquired mitochondrial myopathy' of CKD. It 
is reasonable, therefore, to develop therapeutic interventions that enhance
mitochondrial biogenesis and function as well as skeletal muscle function and
performance in patients with CKD.

Vitamin D deficiency state is endemic in the Kashmir valley of the Indian
subcontinent. Clinicians frequently treat patients with Vitamin D for diverse
clinical symptoms to improve the general health and to reduce the frailty of
elderly and these doses may at times be inappropriately high. Vitamin D
toxicity-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), often considered rare, can be
life-threatening and associated with substantial morbidity if not identified
promptly. We aimed to describe clinical and biochemical features, risk factors,
and management of AKI patients with Vitamin D toxicity seen at a single tertiary 
care centre in Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India,
between January 2014 and January 2016. Evaluation included detailed clinical
history and biochemical tests including serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine,
intact parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. Nineteen patients 
with Vitamin D toxicity-induced AKI could be identified. Clinical manifestations 
included nausea, vomiting, altered sensorium, constipation, pancreatitis, AKI,
acute on chronic kidney disease, and weight loss. Median (range) age was 64
(45-89) years. Median (range) serum 25(OH)D level and median (range) total serum 
calcium level were 99 (190-988) ng/mL and 139 (119-152) mg/dL, respectively.
Overdose of Vitamin D caused by prescription of megadoses of Vitamin D was the
cause of AKI in all cases. Median (range) cumulative Vitamin D dose was 6,000,000
(3,600,000-9,000,000) IU. On three- and six-month follow-up, the creatinine and
estimated glomerular filtration rate normalized and returned to baseline in all
patients except three cases who had underlying chronic kidney disease. Three
patients needed rehospitalization for another episode of AKI. Our data
demonstrate an emergence of Vitamin D toxicity as a cause of AKI in this part of 
the world. Irrational use of Vitamin D in megadoses resulted in AKI in all cases.
Persistence of Vitamin D in the body for longer time resulted in
rehospitalization of patients with AKI. Awareness among health-care providers
regarding the toxic potential of high doses of Vitamin D and cautious use of
Vitamin D supplements can have immense value to prevent this AKI.

Background: Silent cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD) is defined as white
matter hyperintensities, silent brain infarction, or microbleeds. CSVD is
responsible for future vascular events, cognitive impairment, frailty, and
shorter survival. CSVD prevalence among middle-aged people living with
well-controlled human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PLHIV) is unknown.
Methods: The French National Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis
(ANRS) EP51 Microvascular Brain Retina and Kidney Study (MicroBREAK; NCT02082574)
is a cross-sectional study with prospective enrollment of treated PLHIV, ≥50
years old with viral load controlled for ≥12 months, and frequency age- and
sex-matched HIV-uninfected controls (HUCs). It was designed to estimate CSVD
prevalence on 3T magnetic resonance imaging (3D fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery, transversal T2-weighted gradient-echo imaging and diffusion-weighted
imaging), as diagnosed by 2 blinded neuroradiologists. A logistic regression
model was used to assess the impact of HIV on CSVD after adjustment for
traditional risk factors.
Results: Between June 2013 and May 2016, 456 PLHIV and 154 HUCs were recruited.
Median age was 56 and 58 years, respectively (P = .001), among whom 84.9% and
77.3%, respectively (P = .030), were men. CSVD was detected in 51.5% of PLHIV and
36.4% of HUCs with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2.3. The HIV impact differed
according to age, with aOR values of 5.3, 3.7, and 1.0 for age groups <54, 54-60,
and >60 years, respectively (P = .022). Older age, hypertension, and lower CD4
cell count nadir were independently associated with a higher risk of CSVD among
PLHIV.
Conclusions: HIV is an independent risk factor for CSVD. Despite sustained
immunovirological control, the CSVD prevalence was twice as high among
middle-aged PLHIV than HUCs.

Nutrition and Muscle in Cirrhosis.

As the cirrhosis progresses, development of complication like ascites, hepatic
encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, kidney dysfunction, and hepatocellular
carcinoma signify increasing risk of short term mortality. Malnutrition and
muscle wasting (sarcopenia) is yet other complications that negatively impact
survival, quality of life, and response to stressors, such as infection and
surgery in patients with cirrhosis. Conventionally, these are not routinely
looked for, because nutritional assessment can be a difficult especially if there
is associated fluid retention and/or obesity. Patients with cirrhosis may have a 
combination of loss of skeletal muscle and gain of adipose tissue, culminating in
the condition of "sarcopenic obesity." Sarcopenia in cirrhotic patients has been 
associated with increased mortality, sepsis complications, hyperammonemia, overt 
hepatic encephalopathy, and increased length of stay after liver transplantation.
Assessment of muscles with cross-sectional imaging studies has become an
attractive index of nutritional status evaluation in cirrhosis, as sarcopenia,
the major component of malnutrition, is primarily responsible for the adverse
clinical consequences seen in patients with liver disease. Cirrhosis is a state
of accelerated starvation, with increased gluconeogenesis that requires amino
acid diversion from other metabolic functions. Protein homeostasis is disturbed
in cirrhosis due to several factors such as hyperammonemia, hormonal, and
cytokine abnormalities, physical inactivity and direct effects of ethanol and its
metabolites. New approaches to manage sarcopenia are being evolved. Branched
chain amino acid supplementation, Myostatin inhibitors, and mitochondrial
protective agents are currently in various stages of evaluation in preclinical
studies to prevent and reverse sarcopenia, in cirrhosis.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in childhood differs from adult HCC because it is 
often associated with inherited liver disease. It is, however, unclear whether
liver transplantation (LT) for HCC in childhood with or without associated
inherited disease has a comparable outcome to adult HCC. On the basis of data
from the European Liver Transplant Registry (ELTR), we aimed to investigate if
there are differences in patient and graft survival after LT for HCC between
children and adults and between patients with underlying inherited versus
noninherited liver disease, respectively. We included all 175 children who
underwent LT for HCC and were enrolled in ELTR between 1985 and 2012. Of these,
38 had an associated inherited liver disease. Adult HCC patients with (n = 79)
and without (n = 316, matched by age, sex, and LT date) inherited liver disease
served as an adult comparison population. We used multivariable piecewise Cox
regression models with shared frailty terms (for LT center) to compare patient
and graft survival between the different HCC groups. Survival analyses
demonstrated a superior longterm survival of children with inherited liver
disease when compared with children with HCC without inherited liver disease
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.90; P = 0.03) and adults with HCC with
inherited liver disease (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.06-1.25; P = 0.09). There was no
survival difference between adults with and without inherited disease (HR, 1.05; 
95% CI, 0.66-1.66; P = 0.84). In conclusion, the potential survival advantage of 
children with an HCC based on inherited disease should be acknowledged when
considering transplantation and prioritization for these patients. Further
prospective studies accounting for tumor size and extension at LT are necessary
to fully interpret our findings. Liver Transplantation 24 246-255 2018 AASLD.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is prevalent among patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) and is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment. However,
apart from its influence on cognition, it is currently unknown whether frailty
affects subtler cerebral function in patients with ESRD.
METHODS: Patients with ESRD were prospectively enrolled, with clinical features
and laboratory data recorded. The severity of frailty among these patients with
ESRD was ascertained using the previously validated simple FRAIL scale, and was
categorized as none-to-mild and moderate-to-severe frailty. All participants
underwent quantitative electroencephalography (EEG), with band powers documented 
following the generation of the delta to alpha ratio (DAR) and delta/theta to
alpha/beta ratio (DTABR). EEG results were then compared between groups of
different levels of frailty.
RESULTS: In this cohort, (mean age: 68.9 ± 10.4 years, 37% male, 3.4 ± 3 years of
dialysis), 20, 60, 40, 17, and 6% patients exhibited positivity in the fatigue,
resistance, ambulation, illness, and loss-of-body-weight domains, respectively,
with 45.7% being none to mildly frail and 54.3% being moderately to severely
frail. Those with mild frailty had a significantly higher delta power compared to
those with more severe frailty, involving all topographic sites. Patients with
ESRD and severe frailty had significantly lower global, left frontal, left
temporo-occipital, and right temporo-occipital DAR and DTABR, except in the right
frontal area, and tended to have central accentuation of alpha, beta, and theta
power, and more homogeneous DTABR and DAR distribution compared to the findings
in those with mild frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty in patients with ESRD can have subtler neurophysiological
influences, presenting as altered EEG findings, which warrant our attention.

BACKGROUND: Physical frailty and loss of mobility in elderly individuals lead to 
reduced independence, quality of life, and increased mortality. Vitamin B12
deficiency has been linked to several age-related chronic diseases, including in 
the musculo-skeletal system, where vitamin B12 deficiency is generally believed
to be linked to poor nutritional intake. In the present study, we asked whether
aging and frailty associate with altered vitamin B12 homeostasis in humans and
investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms using preclinical models.
METHODS: We analysed a subset of the Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study and
stratified 238 participants based on age and Fried frailty criteria. Levels of
methyl-malonic acid (MMA), a marker for vitamin B12 deficiency, and amnionless,
the vitamin B12 co-receptor that anchors the vitamin B12 transport complex to the
membrane of epithelial cells, were measured in plasma. In addition, vitamin B12
levels and the molecular mechanisms of vitamin B12 uptake and excretion were
analysed in ileum, kidney, liver, and blood using a rat model of natural aging
where nutritional intake is fully controlled.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that aging and frailty are associated with a higher
prevalence of functional vitamin B12 deficiency that can be detected by increased
levels of MMA in blood (ρ = 0.25; P = 0.00013). The decline in circulating
vitamin B12 levels is recapitulated in a rat model of natural aging where food
composition and intake are stable. At the molecular level, these perturbations
involve altered expression of amnionless in the ileum and kidney. Interestingly, 
we demonstrate that amnionless can be detected in serum where its levels increase
during aging in both rodents and human (P = 3.3e-07 and 9.2e-07, respectively).
Blood amnionless levels negatively correlate with vitamin B12 in rats (r2
 = 0.305; P = 0.0042) and positively correlate with the vitamin B12 deficiency
marker MMA in humans (ρ = 0.22; P = 0.00068).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that aging and frailty cause intrinsic
vitamin B12 deficiencies, which can occur independently of nutritional intake.
Mechanistically, vitamin B12 deficiency involves the physio-pathological decline 
of both the intestinal uptake and the renal reabsorption system for vitamin B12. 
Finally, amnionless is a novel biomarker which can detect perturbed vitamin B12
bioavailability during aging and physical frailty.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty among the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population is highly 
prevalent and has been associated with mortality. Little is known about the
relation of different aspects of body composition, a modifiable risk factor, with
the risk of frailty in ESRD population.
DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-one patients including 85 men and 66
women, aged ≥18 years with ESRD who had been receiving conventional maintenance
hemodialysis (HD) for at least 3 months were included. Body fat and muscle mass
from both bioimpedance spectroscopy and skin-fold thickness and waist
circumference as a surrogate of abdominal obesity were measured. Frailty was
defined based on Fried's criteria. Health-related quality of life was collected
using the RAND version of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36) Survey.
RESULTS: We performed single and multiple predictor logistic regression analyses 
to determine factors associated with frailty. After adjustment for age, sex, and 
comorbidities, fat mass (both by bioimpedance spectroscopy and anthropometry) and
waist circumference, but not muscle mass remained the main predictors of frailty.
The odds ratio of frailty in the third tertile compared with the first was 4.97
(1.70-14.55) and 3.84 (1.39-10.61) for fat mass and waist circumference,
respectively (P for trends for both <.05). The scores of physical health and
kidney disease effect component of quality of life were lower in frail compared
with nonfrail patients (40.7 ± 9.2 vs. 33.7 ± 10.2, P < .01 and 66.8 ± 22.4 vs.
51.6 ± 25.7, P < .05 for physical health and effects of disease, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty, which is associated with poor outcomes in chronic HD
patients, is common and predicted by fat mass and waist circumference but not by 
body mass index and muscle mass. Interventions to modify abdominal obesity,
reflected by waist circumference, could potentially lower the incidence of
frailty and hence improve the quality of life in the HD population.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by progressive and
irreversible deterioration of renal function due to the reduction of nephron mass
for a period of at least three months. The prevalence of CKD is roughly 10% in
the general population but increases with age, affecting more than one-third of
people older than 65. Frailty is a condition usually found in elderly people,
characterized by weakness, motility, and balance issues, with a declined ability 
to resist stressors leading to increased risks of adverse health outcomes
including falls, fracture, hospitalization, institutionalization, disability,
dependence, dementia, poor quality of life, and death. There is interdependence
between CKD and normal ageing whereby CKD makes ageing more accelerated and
pronounced (senescence), whereas senescence accelerates chronic nephropathy's
progression. Frailty status catalyzes this spiral, with renal and systemic
consequences, phenomenon which can be named senescent nephropathy. In conclusion,
senescent nephropathy is a new renal syndrome that should be taken into account, 
and we must try to handle its appearance and progression not only by applying
nephron prevention measurements but also by diagnosis and treating frailty in the
CKD population.

Introduction: Frailty and muscle wasting, a component of frailty, are common in
advanced stage chronic kidney disease (CKD). Whether frailty is associated with
low urinary creatinine excretion (UCrE) as a measure of muscle mass in this
population is unknown. Furthermore, reference values of UCrE are lacking. We
first defined low UCrE and studied correlates of low UCrE, and subsequently
studied cross-sectional associations of frailty with low UCrE in patients with
advanced CKD.
Methods: A total of 2748 healthy individuals of the general population-based
PREVEND study were included to define low UCrE (UCrE indexed for height, below
the age- and sex-specific 5th percentile of the distribution). Frailty was
defined using a modification of the Fried frailty phenotype. In a CKD population 
that included 320 and 967 participants of the PREPARE-2 and NECOSAD studies,
respectively, cross-sectional associations of self-reported frailty, the
individual components that define self-reported frailty, and frailty-associated
variables with low UCrE were evaluated using multivariate logistic and linear
regression models.
Results: Low UCrE was found in 38% of the CKD patients. A lower glomerular
filtration rate was strongly associated with low UCrE. Self-reported frailty
(adjusted odds ratio: 2.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.28-3.77) and the
individual components were associated with low UCrE, independent of
comorbidities. The frailty-associated variables hemoglobin and albumin were
inversely associated with low UCrE, and parathyroid hormone was positively
associated with low UCrE.
Discussion: Lower kidney function is a strong correlate of low UCrE and
self-reported frailty, and the individual frailty components are associated with 
low UCrE as well, independent of comorbidities.

In longitudinal studies, a subject may have different types of outcomes that
could be correlated. For example, a response variable of interest would be
measured repeatedly over time on the same subject and at the same time, an event 
time representing a single event or competing-risks event is also observed. In
this paper, we propose a joint modeling framework that accounts for the inherent 
association between such multiple outcomes via frailties (unobserved random
effects). Among outcomes, at least one outcome is an event time that has a type
of a single event or competing-risks event. For inference we use the hierarchical
likelihood (h-likelihood) that provides an unified efficient fitting procedure
for the joint models. Numerical studies are provided to show the performance of
the proposed method and two data examples are shown.

AIM: A recent, growing concern regarding haemodialysis in Japan is a sustained
increase in the elderly population. Among very elderly people who start
haemodialysis, the prognosis is considered to be poor; however, this has not been
fully elucidated. This study aimed to discover the short-term prognosis and
related factors in very elderly patients who commence haemodialysis.
METHODS: Between January 2008 and December 2013, 122 patients aged ≥85 years at
haemodialysis initiation were documented in our hospital. Predictors of 90-day
and 1-year mortality after haemodialysis initiation were assessed with Cox
proportional hazards regression analysis. Selection of covariates for the
multivariate model was based on forward stepwise selection using the probability 
of a likelihood ratio statistics.
RESULTS: The subjects' mean age was 87.4 ± 2.5 years, and 48% were female. The
most common cause of death was infection (38% of patients) and the leading cause 
of infectious death was pneumonia. The 90-day and 1-year survival rates were 81% 
and 62%, respectively. Suboptimal initiation was a significant prognostic factor 
for 90-day [hazard ratio (HR) 3.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-13.43] and 
1-year [HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.51-6.76] mortality after adjusting for confounders in
multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSION: Very elderly patients who started haemodialysis had a poor prognosis,
and suboptimal initiation significantly predicted outcome. Shared decision-making
with patients and their families is needed for initiating haemodialysis on the
conditions that appropriate information on the expected prognosis is provided.

BACKGROUND: Although individuals classified as nonresident aliens, including
undocumented immigrants, are entitled to receive emergency dialysis in the United
States regardless of their ability to pay, most states do not provide them with
subsidized care for maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation. We explored
whether nonresident aliens have similar outcomes to US citizens after receiving
kidney transplants covered by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health
insurance program.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: All adult Medicaid patients in the US Renal Data System
who received their first kidney transplant from 1990 to 2011.
PREDICTOR: Citizenship status, categorized as US citizen, nonresident alien, or
permanent resident.
OUTCOME: All-cause transplant loss.
MEASUREMENTS: HRs and 95% CIs estimated by applying Cox proportional hazards
frailty models with transplantation center as a random effect.
RESULTS: Of 10,495 patients, 8,660 (82%) were US citizens, 1,489 (14%) were
permanent residents, and 346 (3%) were nonresident aliens, whom we assumed were
undocumented immigrants. Nonresident aliens were younger, healthier, receiving
dialysis longer, and more likely to have had a living donor. 71% underwent
transplantation in California, and 61% underwent transplantation after 2005.
Nonresident aliens had a lower unadjusted risk for transplant loss compared with 
US citizens (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.35-0.65). Results were attenuated but still
significant when adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, dialysis, and
transplant-related factors (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.94).
LIMITATIONS: Citizenship status was self-reported, possible residual confounding.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the select group of insured nonresident
aliens who undergo transplantation with Medicaid do just as well as US citizens
with Medicaid. Policymakers should consider expanding coverage for kidney
transplantation in nonresident aliens, including undocumented immigrants, given
the associated high-quality outcomes in these patients.

BACKGROUND: Short-term prognosis, e.g. mortality at three months, has many
important implications in planning the overall management of patients,
particularly non-oncologic patients in order to avoid futile practices. The aims 
of this study were: i) to investigate the risk of three-month mortality after
discharge from internal medicine and geriatric wards of non-oncologic patients
with at least one of the following conditions: permanent bedridden status during 
the hospital stay; severely reduced kidney function; hypoalbuminemia; hospital
admissions in the previous six months; severe dementia; ii) to establish the
absolute risk difference of three-month mortality of bedridden compared to
non-bedridden patients.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study was run in 102 Italian internal medicine
and geriatric hospital wards. The sample included all patients with three-months 
follow-up data. Bedridden condition was defined as the inability to walk or stand
upright during the whole hospital stay. The following parameters were also
recorded: estimated GFR≤29mL/min/1.73m2; severe dementia; albuminemia ≪2.5g/dL;
hospital admissions in the six months before the index admission.
RESULTS: Of 3915 patients eligible for the analysis, three-month follow-up were
available for 2058, who were included in the study. Bedridden patients were 112
and the absolute risk difference of mortality at three months was 0.13 (CI 95%
0.08-0.19, p≪0.0001). Logistic regression analysis also adjusted for age, sex,
number of drugs and comorbidity index found that bedridden condition (OR 2.10, CI
95% 1.12-3.94), severely reduced kidney function (OR 2.27, CI 95% 1.22-4.21),
hospital admission in the previous six months (OR 1.96, CI 95% 1.22-3.14), severe
dementia (with total or severe physical dependence) (OR 4.16, CI 95% 2.39-7.25)
and hypoalbuminemia (OR 2.47, CI 95% 1.12-5.44) were significantly associated
with higher risk of three-month mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Bedridden status, severely reduced kidney function, recent hospital 
admissions, severe dementia and hypoalbuminemia were associated with higher risk 
of three-month mortality in non-oncologic patients after discharge from internal 
medicine and geriatric hospital wards.

Objectives　To investigate the relationship between frailty, metabolic syndrome
(MetS), and loss of independence leading to the onset of disability or death
among community-dwelling older Japanese.Methods　Between 2002 and 2011, we
conducted a 7-year prospective study involving 1,453 residents aged 65 years and 
over, initially free of disability, who underwent a comprehensive geriatric
assessment in Kusatsu town. Statistical analysis was conducted for those with
complete values, resulting in a variable number of subjects for each data point. 
Frailty was defined for 1,335 subjects as three or more of the following
criteria: weight loss (>2-3 kg in the past six months), weakness (grip strength
was <26 kg for men and <18 kg for women), exhaustion (answer of "no" to the
question "Do you feel full of energy?" on the Geriatric Depression Scale),
slowness (usual gait speed<1.0 m/s), and low physical activity (answer of "less
than once a week" to the question "How often do you usually go outdoors?"). MetS 
was defined for 1,450 subjects from the Japanese definition. The Cox
proportional-hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) of
loss of independence for 1,217 subjects.Results　During the follow-up, 494 cases
of loss of independence, including 376 disabilities and 118 deaths were
identified. In men and women, the incidence of the loss of independence showed a 
significant linear trend according to the severity classification of frailty. By 
contrast, there was no relationship between MetS and the loss of independence.
Subjects classified as prefrail and frail had an increased risk of loss of
independence compared with robust participants, with sex- and age-adjusted HRs
(95% CIs) of 1.5 (1.2-1.9) and 2.4 (1.8-3.3), respectively. After adjusting for
sex, age, the presence of MetS, low serum total cholesterol, chronic kidney
disease, anemia, low serum albumin, cognitive impairment, and past history of
stroke, the respective multivariable HRs (95% CIs) of loss of independence were
1.5 (1.2-1.9) and 2.1 (1.5-2.9). The magnitude of the risk of loss of
independence incidence for frailty was greater among the subjects aged 65-74
years than those aged ≥75 years.Conclusions　Frailty was significantly associated 
with incident loss of independence among elderly Japanese. The presence of MetS
had no effect on subsequent onset of disability and mortality in elderly
Japanese. Our findings suggest screening and intervention for frailty in the
early stage of aging are beneficial to prolong healthy life expectancy of elderly
Japanese.

Introduction: Labeling a patient as "frail" may be useful in assessing the
prognosis and therapeutic approach.
Objective: The aim of the study is to define a pattern of frailty among our
dialysis population, to analyse the incidence and clinical evolution of these
patients.
Materials and Methods: We analysed a total of 320 patients with stage V chronic
kidney disease (CKD) who were on hemodialysis between September 2014 and
September 2015. To define a patient as frail we used the Fried phenotype model,
and we added a new criteria-dialysis session length longer than 12 hours/week.
Results: 5.6% of the 320 patients were frail. We found statistically significant 
differences regarding body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin (Hgb), and serum albumin,
as well as the ability to perform the basic activities of daily living (p <
0.005), ability to ambulate (p = 0.01) and perform transfers (p < 0.005). We
found statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of
hospital admissions (p = 0.005) and mortality (p < 0.005).
Conclusion: 5.6% of the study population were frail, with lower BMI, serum
albumin and hemoglobin, lower capacity for basic activities of daily living,
ambulation, and transference, as well as higher morbidity and mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between serum β2-microglobulin (B2M) levels
and frailty in an elderly Chinese population.
DESIGN: A population-based cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data on 1,663 elderly participants (aged 70-84 
years) from the aging arm of the Rugao Longevity and Ageing study, a
population-based observational two-arm cohort study conducted in Rugao, China.
MEASUREMENTS: The serum B2M was measured with chemiluminescence immunoassay by a 
technician in the biochemistry laboratory of the Rugao People's Hospital.
Information on the frailty index and phenotype was collected.
RESULTS: The mean B2M levels and frailty index were 1.8 mg/L and 0.16,
respectively; 188 (11.3%) participants were classified as frail (frailty
phenotype). For a standard deviation increase in B2M, the adjusted odds ratio for
frailty phenotype was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.39; P=0.009) and the standardized
coefficient for frailty index was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.11; P=0.004). Relative to
the lowest quartile, the highest B2M quartile had a greater risk of prevalent
frailty with adjusted odds ratios of 1.68 (95% CI: 1.04, 2.71; P=0.034) for
frailty phenotype and 1.51 (95% CI: 1.01, 2.27; P=0.044) for frailty index
(≥0.25). In addition, estimated glomerular filtration rate (based on B2M) or
chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
was significantly associated with frailty phenotype and index.
CONCLUSION: B2M was significantly associated with both frailty phenotype and
index in elderly Chinese population. The findings underscore the promising kidney
relevant biomarkers for identifying vulnerable elderly Chinese population.

BACKGROUND: Contemporary options for aortic valve replacement (AVR) include
transcatheter and surgical approaches (TAVR and SAVR). As evidence accrues for
TAVR in high and intermediate risk patients, some clinicians advocate that all
patients aged over 80 years should only receive TAVR. Our aim was to investigate 
the utility of SAVR and minimally invasive AVR (mAVR) among octogenarians in the 
current era of TAVR.
METHODS: From 2002 to 2015, 1,028 octogenarians underwent isolated AVR; 306 TAVR 
and 722 SAVR, of which 378 patients underwent mAVR. Logistic regression and Cox
modeling were used to evaluate overall operative mortality and mid-term survival,
respectively. Patients were stratified based on procedural approaches (mAVR or
full sternotomy for SAVR, and transfemoral or alternate access for TAVR). Median 
follow-up was 35 [interquartile range (IQR) 14-65] months.
RESULTS: Compared to SAVR patients, TAVR patients were relatively older (86.2
versus 84.2 years) with co-morbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD),
diabetes mellitus (DM), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and prior myocardial
infarction (MI), all P<0.05. The mean STS-PROM for the TAVR group was
statistically higher, 6.81 versus 5.58 for the SAVR group (P<0.001). The median
in-hospital LOS was statistically higher for the SAVR group (P<0.05). Cox
proportional hazard modeling, adjusted for temporal differences in procedure and 
patient selection, identified age, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class
III/IV, preoperative creatinine, severe chronic lung disease, prior cardiac
surgery as significant predictors of decreased survival (all P<0.05), while type 
of intervention (approach) was non-contributory. Adjusted operative mortality
stratified by procedure approaches was similar between full sternotomy SAVR and
mAVR, and between alternative access and transfemoral TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for confounders, TAVR (regardless of approach),
SAVR, and mAVR had comparable operative mortality and mid-term survival.
Treatment decisions should be individualized with consensus from a
multi-disciplinary heart team, taking into account patient co morbidities,
frailty, and quality of life. We believe certain patient groups will still
benefit from SAVR even in this elderly population.

Background: The hormone klotho, encoded by the gene klotho, is primarily
expressed in the kidney and choroid plexus of the brain. Higher klotho
concentrations have been linked to better physical performance; however, it is
unknown whether klotho relates to frailty status in older adults.
Methods: Plasma klotho was measured in 774 participants aged ≥ 65 years enrolled 
in InCHIANTI, a prospective cohort study comprising Italian adults. Frailty
status was assessed at three and six years after enrollment. Frailty was defined 
as presence of at least three out of the five criteria of unintentional weight
loss, exhaustion, sedentariness, muscle weakness, and slow walking speed;
prefrailty was defined as presence of one or two criteria; and robustness was
defined as zero criteria. We assessed whether plasma klotho concentrations
measured at the three-year visit related to frailty.
Results: Each additional natural logarithm of klotho (pg/mL) was associated with 
lower odds of frailty versus robustness after adjustment for covariates (Odds
Ratio [OR] 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21, 0.98; p-value=0.045). Higher 
klotho was particularly associated with lower odds of exhaustion (OR 0.57; 95% CI
0.36, 0.89; p-value=0.014). Participants with higher klotho also had lower
estimated odds of weight loss and weakness, but these findings were not
statistically significant.
Conclusions: Higher plasma klotho concentrations were associated with lower
likelihoods of frailty and particularly exhaustion. Future studies should
investigate modifiable mechanisms through which klotho may affect the frailty
syndrome.

AIM: To evaluate the relationship between kidney function without diabetes and
components of the frailty phenotype in community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: Participants were 8343 residents who completed baseline assessments,
classified into four categories according to eGFR. Frailty status was defined
using five criteria: (i) slow gait speed; (ii) muscle weakness; (iii) low
physical activity; (iv) exhaustion; and (v) unintentional weight loss.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with the lowest kidney
function were at higher risk of frailty (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02-3.50) than those
with normal kidney function. In addition, after adjustment for multiple
confounders, estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 was associated with a
greater risk of the individual frailty components of weight loss (OR 2.14, 95% CI
1.11-4.12), low physical activity (OR 1.35, 95% CI, 1.01-2.54) and slowness (OR
1.82, 95% CI 1.36-3.77) compared with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower kidney function was associated with a higher risk of weight
loss, low physical activity and slowness among community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 286-292.

Objective To determine the safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use
compared with warfarin use for the treatment of venous
thromboembolism.Design Retrospective matched cohort study conducted between 1
January 2009 and 31 March 2016.Setting Community based, using healthcare data
from six jurisdictions in Canada and the United States.Participants 59 525 adults
(12 489 DOAC users; 47 036 warfarin users) with a new diagnosis of venous
thromboembolism and a prescription for a DOAC or warfarin within 30 days of
diagnosis.Main outcome measures Outcomes included hospital admission or emergency
department visit for major bleeding and all cause mortality within 90 days after 
starting treatment. Propensity score matching and shared frailty models were used
to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of the outcomes comparing DOACs with warfarin.
Analyses were conducted independently at each site, with meta-analytical methods 
used to estimate pooled hazard ratios across sites.Results Of the 59 525
participants, 1967 (3.3%) had a major bleed and 1029 (1.7%) died over a mean
follow-up of 85.2 days. The risk of major bleeding was similar for DOAC compared 
with warfarin use (pooled hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to
1.03), with the overall direction of the association favouring DOAC use. No
difference was found in the risk of death (pooled hazard ratio 0.99, 0.84 to
1.16) for DOACs compared with warfarin use. There was no evidence of
heterogeneity across centres, between patients with and without chronic kidney
disease, across age groups, or between male and female patients.Conclusions In
this analysis of adults with incident venous thromboembolism, treatment with
DOACs, compared with warfarin, was not associated with an increased risk of major
bleeding or all cause mortality in the first 90 days of treatment.Trial
registration Clinical trials NCT02833987.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of physical 
activity on various aspects in Asian dialysis patients.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Study participants were recruited
from 27 hospitals or dialysis centers in Korea (n = 1611). The participants were 
divided into 3 groups according to the degree of regular exercise: Inactive
group, Intermediate group, and Active group.
RESULTS: The proportions of patients with frailty and the presence of each
component decreased as physical activity increased. The presence and numbers of
disabilities decreased as physical activity increased. The number of participants
with a history of fall during the last 12 months was 149 (20.5%) in the Inactive 
group, 88 (16.9%) in the Intermediate group, and 48 (13.2%) in the Active group. 
Physical component scale and mental component scale scores increased as physical 
activity increased. The survival rate for all-cause death at 500 days was 95.5%
in the Active group, 95.2% in the Intermediate group, and 93.5% in the Inactive
group.
CONCLUSION: High physical activity was associated with favorable results for most
health-related quality of life scale scores, including frailty, disability, and
exhaustion, in Korean dialysis patients.

The aging process differs in important ways between the sexes, with women living 
longer but at higher risk for frailty (the male-female health-survival paradox). 
The underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood, but may relate to 
sex differences in physiological dysregulation patterns. Here, using biomarkers
from two longitudinal cohort studies (InCHIANTI and BLSA) and one cross-sectional
survey (NHANES), we assess sex differences in trajectories of dysregulation
globally and for five physiological systems: oxygen transport, electrolytes,
hematopoiesis, lipids, and liver/kidney function. We found higher dysregulation
levels in men, both globally and in the oxygen transport and hematopoietic
systems (p < .001 for all), though differences for other systems were mixed
(electrolytes) or absent (lipids and liver/kidney). There was no clear evidence
for sex differences in rates of change in dysregulation with age. Although risk
of frailty and mortality increase with dysregulation, there was no evidence for
differences in these effects between sexes. These findings imply that the greater
susceptibility of women to frailty is not simply due to a tolerance for higher
dysregulation; rather, it may actually be men that have a greater tolerance for
dysregulation, creating a male-female dysregulation-frailty paradox. However, the
precise physiological mechanisms underlying the sex differences appear to be
diffuse and hard to pin down.

Little is known about the clinical significance of frailty and changes of frailty
after dialysis initiation in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). We prospectively enrolled 46 elderly patients with incident ESRD at a
dialysis center of a tertiary hospital between May 2013 and March 2015. Frailty
was assessed by using a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol and defined
as a multidimensional frailty score of ≥ 10. The main outcome was the composite
of all-cause death or cardiovascular hospitalization, as determined in June 2016.
The median age of the 46 participants was 71.5 years, and 63.0% of them were men.
During the median 17.7 months follow-up, the rate of composite outcome was 17.4%.
In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, sex,
diabetes, body mass index (BMI), and time of predialytic nephrologic care, female
sex, and increased BMI were associated with increased and decreased odds of
frailty, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, after
adjusting for age, sex, diabetes, BMI, and time of predialytic nephrologic care, 
frailty was significantly associated with the composite adverse outcome. In
repeated frailty assessments, the multidimensional frailty score significantly
improved 12 months after the initiation of dialysis, which largely relied on
improved nutrition. Therefore, frailty needs to be assessed for risk
stratification in elderly patients with incident ESRD.

OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with higher mortality.
We aimed to identify the baseline predictors of in-hospital mortality among
elderly patients with non-valvular AF (NVAF) hospitalised for any reason.
METHODS: Observational, prospective and multicentre study was carried out on
patients with NVAF over the age of 75, who had been admitted for any acute
medical condition to Internal Medicine departments in Spain.
RESULTS: We evaluated 804 patients with a mean age of 85±5.1years, of which 53.9%
were females. During the hospitalization 10.1% (n=81) of the patients died. The
patients who died were older, had a greater percentage of institutionalization,
worse previous basic functional status (Barthel Index), worse cognitive
performance at admission and greater proportion of frailty and sarcopenia.
Logistic regression multivariate analysis identified that the strongest
determinants of in-hospital mortality were the baseline functional status
(Barthel Index) (OR for total dependency 4.73, 95% CI 2.32-9.63), and admissions 
for stroke (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.41-8.90) and acute renal failure (OR 1.93, 95% CI
1.12-3.32).
CONCLUSION: The overall in-hospital mortality of elderly patients with NVFA is
high. Among all factors evaluated in the global geriatric assessment the baseline
functional status was the strongest predictor for in-hospital mortality on this
population.

BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness is a risk factor for mortality in hemodialysis (HD)
patients. Muscle strength measurements are routinely used as a screening tool but
depend on patient cooperation and motivation. We wished to determine whether
measuring maximal voluntary muscle strength was affected by patient self-reported
distress.
METHODS: We measured pinch strength (PS) and handgrip strength (HGS) in 382 adult
HD patients with a corresponding self-reported distress thermometer (DT) scores. 
Postdialysis body composition measurements were made using multifrequency
bioelectrical assessments and patients assessed for frailty.
RESULTS: Mean age was 66.4 ± 14.9 years, with 238 males (62%), 48% diabetic, and 
dialysis vintage 36 (15-75) months. The mean DT score was 4.4 ± 3.3, with a
frailty score of 4.6 ± 1.5. On multivariable analysis, DT scores were associated 
with frailty (β = 0.35, P = .003), prescription of aspirin for cardiac disease (β
= 1.0, P = .004), lean body mass (β = 0.04, P = .004), and negatively with age (β
= -0.05, P < .001), hematocrit (β = -8.2, P = .004), and maximum PS (β = -1.4, P 
= .003).
CONCLUSION: Paradoxically higher self-reported DT scores were associated with
younger age and lean body mass. As such, younger healthier, rather than more
comorbid, patients may have greater expectations for their health and therefore
report more distress. We found no association between DT scores and HGS, and as
such, although HGS is a voluntary test, it appears to be a robust test
independent of patient stresses. However, PS was lower in patients with higher DT
scores, and as such, greater care may be required in interpreting these
measurements.

Objectives To derive and validate a risk prediction equation to estimate the
short term risk of death, and to develop a classification method for frailty
based on risk of death and risk of unplanned hospital
admission.Design Prospective open cohort study.Participants Routinely collected
data from 1436 general practices contributing data to QResearch in England
between 2012 and 2016. 1079 practices were used to develop the scores and a
separate set of 357 practices to validate the scores. 1.47 million patients aged 
65-100 years were in the derivation cohort and 0.50 million patients in the
validation cohort.Methods Cox proportional hazards models in the derivation
cohort were used to derive separate risk equations in men and women for
evaluation of the risk of death at one year. Risk factors considered were age,
sex, ethnicity, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol intake, body mass index,
medical conditions, specific drugs, social factors, and results of recent
investigations. Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the
validation cohort for men and women separately and for each age and ethnic group.
The new mortality equation was used in conjunction with the existing QAdmissions 
equation (which predicts risk of unplanned hospital admission) to classify
patients into frailty groups.Main outcome measure The primary outcome was all
cause mortality.Results During follow-up 180 132 deaths were identified in the
derivation cohort arising from 4.39 million person years of observation. The
final model included terms for age, body mass index, Townsend score, ethnic
group, smoking status, alcohol intake, unplanned hospital admissions in the past 
12 months, atrial fibrillation, antipsychotics, cancer, asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, living in a care home, congestive heart failure,
corticosteroids, cardiovascular disease, dementia, epilepsy, learning disability,
leg ulcer, chronic liver disease or pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, poor
mobility, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2
diabetes, venous thromboembolism, anaemia, abnormal liver function test result,
high platelet count, visited doctor in the past year with either appetite loss,
unexpected weight loss, or breathlessness. The model had good calibration and
high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, the equation
explained 55.6% of the variation in time to death (R2), and had very good
discrimination-the D statistic was 2.29, and Harrell's C statistic value was
0.85. The corresponding values for men were 53.1%, 2.18, and 0.84. By combining
predicted risks of mortality and unplanned hospital admissions, 2.7% of patients 
(n=13 665) were classified as severely frail, 9.4% (n=46 770) as moderately
frail, 43.1% (n=215 253) as mildly frail, and 44.8% (n=223 790) as
fit.Conclusions We have developed new equations to predict the short term risk of
death in men and women aged 65 or more, taking account of demographic, social,
and clinical variables. The equations had good performance on a separate
validation cohort. The QMortality equations can be used in conjunction with the
QAdmissions equations, to classify patients into four frailty groups (known as
QFrailty categories) to enable patients to be identified for further assessment
or interventions.

Persons living with HIV (PLWH) have accentuated risks for age-associated
comorbidities. Compared to the general population, PLWH have a 2-fold higher risk
of cardiovascular disease, a 3-fold increased risk of fracture, and a risk of
kidney disease that is comparable to that in diabetes. Some comorbidities may
present at younger ages than among the general population, suggesting the
possibility of accelerated aging with HIV infection.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) reflects a patient's disease
burden, treatment effectiveness, and health status and is summarized by physical,
mental, and kidney disease-specific scales among end-stage renal disease
patients. Although on average HRQOL improves postkidney transplant (KT), the
degree of change depends on the ability of the patient to withstand the stressor 
of dialysis versus the ability to tolerate the intense physiologic changes of KT.
Frail KT recipients may be extra vulnerable to either of these stressors, thus
affecting change in HRQOL after KT.
METHODS: We ascertained frailty, as well as physical, mental, and kidney
disease-specific HRQOL in a multicenter prospective cohort of 443 KT recipients
(May 2014 to May 2017) using Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument Short
Form. We quantified the short-term (3 months) rate of post-KT HRQOL change by
frailty status using adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models.
RESULTS: Mean HRQOL scores at KT were 43.3 (SD, 9.6) for physical, 52.8 (SD, 8.9)
for mental, and 72.6 (SD, 12.8) for kidney disease-specific HRQOL; frail
recipients had worse physical (P < 0.001) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL (P = 
0.001), but similar mental HRQOL (P = 0.43). Frail recipients experienced
significantly greater rates of improvement in physical HRQOL (frail, 1.35
points/month; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-2.05; nonfrail, 0.34
points/month; 95% CI, -0.17-0.85; P = 0.02) and kidney disease-specific HRQOL
(frail, 3.75 points/month; 95% CI, 2.89-4.60; nonfrail, 2.41 points/month; 95%
CI, 1.78-3.04; P = 0.01), but no difference in mental HRQOL (frail, 0.54
points/month; 95% CI, -0.17-1.25; nonfrail, 0.46 points/month; 95% CI,
-0.06-0.98; P = 0.85) post-KT.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite decreased physiologic reserve, frail recipients experience
improvement in post-KT physical and kidney disease-specific HRQOL better than
nonfrail recipients.

Hyperphosphatemia is related to some pathologies, affecting vascular cell
behavior. This work analyzes whether high concentration of extracellular
phosphate induces endothelial senescence through up-regulation of endothelin-1
(ET-1), exploring the mechanisms involved. The phosphate donor β-glycerophosphate
(BGP) in human endothelial cells increased ET-1 production, endothelin-converting
enzyme-1 (ECE-1) protein, and mRNA expression, which depend on the AP-1
activation through ROS production. In parallel, BGP also induced endothelial
senescence by increasing p16 expression and the senescence-associated
β-galactosidase (SA-ß-GAL) activity. ET-1 itself was able to induce endothelial
senescence, increasing p16 expression and SA-ß-GAL activity. In addition,
senescence induced by BGP was blocked when different ET-1 system antagonists were
used. BGP increased ROS production at short times, and the presence of
antioxidants prevented the effect of BGP on AP1 activation, ECE-1 expression, and
endothelial senescence. These findings were confirmed in vivo with two animal
models in which phosphate serum levels were increased: seven/eight nephrectomized
rats as chronic kidney disease models fed on a high phosphate diet and aged mice.
Both models showed hyperphosphatemia, higher levels of ET-1, and up-regulation in
aortic ECE-1, suggesting a direct relationship between hyperphosphatemia and
ET-1. Present results point to a new and relevant role of hyperphosphatemia on
the regulation of ET-1 system and senescence induction at endothelial level, both
in endothelial cells and aorta from two animal models. The mechanism involved
showed a higher ROS production, which probably activates AP-1 transcription
factor and, as a result, ECE-1 expression, increasing ET-1 synthesis, which in
consequence induces endothelial senescence.

OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia measured by decreased psoas muscle size has been used as a 
surrogate for frailty and correlates with adverse outcomes in both the short and 
long term after many major operations. Our aim was to evaluate this measure as a 
predictor of outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular aortic aneurysm repair 
(EVAR).
METHODS: Once Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, all patients who 
underwent EVAR from December 2010 to March 2016 at a Veterans Affairs hospital
were assessed for sarcopenia by total psoas muscle area (TPA) measured on axial
computed tomography scan immediately inferior to the fourth lumbar (L4) superior 
end plate. Outcomes including length of stay and mortality were collected from
the medical record.
RESULTS: There were 135 patients who underwent EVAR at a median age of 70 years. 
Median aneurysm size was 5.5 cm. Length of stay was >2 days in 25% of patients
(n = 33), with the most common reasons for delayed discharge including
respiratory complications (8.9% [n = 12]) and urinary retention (4.0% [n = 9]).
Low TPA was not associated with extended length of stay (P = .40). Patients with 
lowest tertile TPA had 42% 5-year survival compared with 93% survival observed
for the remaining two-thirds of patients (P = .01). Multivariate analysis
revealed increased likelihood of mortality at 5 years for patients in the lowest 
tertile for TPA (odds ratio, 3.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.9) as well as
for patients with chronic kidney disease (odds ratio, 5.2; 95% confidence
interval, 1.5-18.0).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative sarcopenia does not appear to affect length of stay but
does portend worse long-term survival. This simple preoperative measurement may
help vascular surgeons tailor repair thresholds and avoid nonbeneficial
procedures.

To assess whether biopsy-guided selection of kidneys from very old brain-dead
donors enables more successful transplantations, the authors of this multicenter,
observational study compared graft survival between 37 recipients of 1 or 2
histologically evaluated kidneys from donors older than 80 years and 198
reference-recipients of non-histologically evaluated single grafts from donors
aged 60 years and younger (transplantation period: 2006-2013 at 3 Italian
centers). During a median (interquartile range) of 25 (13-42) months, 2
recipients (5.4%) and 10 reference-recipients (5.1%) required dialysis (crude and
donor age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.55
[0.34-7.12], P = .576 and 1.41 [0.10-19.54], P = .798, respectively). Shared
frailty analyses confirmed similar outcomes in a 1:2 propensity score study
comparing recipients with 74 reference-recipients matched by center, year, donor,
and recipient sex and age. Serum creatinine was similar across groups during
84-month follow-up. Recipients had remarkably shorter waiting times than did
reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients (7.5 [4.0-19.5] vs 36
[19-56] and 40 [24-56] months, respectively, P < .0001 for both comparisons).
Mean (± SD) kidney donor risk index was 2.57 ± 0.32 in recipients vs 1.09 ± 0.24 
and 1.14 ± 0.24 in reference-recipients and matched reference-recipients
(P < .0001 for both comparisons). Adverse events were similar across groups.
Biopsy-guided allocation of kidneys from octogenarian donors permits further
expansion of the donor organ pool and faster access to a kidney transplant,
without increasing the risk of premature graft failure.

AIM: to assess the prevalence of some geriatric syndromes and their association
with high risk of cardiovascular complications (RCVC) among elderly women.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined 72 women aged 69-77 years with cardiovascular
diseases. Examination included laboratory and echocardiography assessment,
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, 6-min walk test, assessment of psycho-emotional
status using Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire. Frailty was
defined as three or more of the following: weight loss, low physical activity
levels, MMSE less or equal 23 points, weakness (chair stand test>10 sec), history
of multiple falls. Follow up was 7.3 (5.5-7.8) months.
RESULTS: High CVR was found in 70.8% women: in 59.1% women aged 65-74 years and
in 89.3% - aged more or equal 75 years, =0.006. Osteoporosis (OP) was found in
51.3% women aged 65-74 and in 90.5% - aged more or equal 75 years, =0.024; MMSE
was 27 (24-28) vs 24 (20-26) points, respectively, =0.008. The geriatric syndrome
of frailty was found in 13.6% women aged 65-74 and in 64.3% - aged more or equal 
75 years. Frailty was associated with high CVR (odds ratio [R] 7.2, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.5-34.2, =0.013), chronic kidney disease (CKD, R 18.9, 
95%CI 5.2-20.2, <0.001), P (R 4.5, 95%CI 1.3-15.8, =0.019), history of myocardial
infarction (MI, R 6.8, 95%CI 2.2-20.8, =0.001), greater age (R 6.0, 95%CI
2.1-17.5, =0.001).
CONCLUSION: High CVR was prevalent among greater age women what could be
explained by prevalence of chronic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, CKD.
Prevalence of frailty was 13.6 and 64.3% among women aged 65-74 and more or equal
75years, respectively. It was significantly associated with high CVR, OP, PMI,
CKD.

Aortic stenosis is one of the most frequent valvular diseases in developed
countries, and its impact on public health resources and assistance is
increasing. A substantial proportion of elderly people with severe aortic
stenosis is not eligible to surgery because of the advanced age, frailty, and
multiple co-morbidities. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) enables
the treatment of very elderly patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk
considered ineligible for surgery and with an acceptable life expectancy.
However, a significant percentage of patients die or show no improvement in
quality of life (QOL) in the follow-up. In the decision-making process, it is
important to determine: (i) whether and how much frailty of the patient
influences the risk of procedures; (ii) how the QOL and the individual patient's 
survival are influenced by aortic valve disease or from other associated
conditions; and (iii) whether a geriatric specialist intervention to evaluate and
correct frailty or other diseases with their potential or already manifest
disabilities can improve the outcome of surgery or TAVI. Consequently, in
addition to risk stratification with conventional tools, a number of factors
including multi-morbidity, disability, frailty, and cognitive function should be 
considered, in order to assess the expected benefit of both surgery and TAVI. The
pre-operative optimization through a multidisciplinary approach with a Heart Team
can counteract the multiple damage (cardiac, neurological, muscular, respiratory,
and kidney) that can potentially aggravate the reduced physiological reserves
characteristic of frailty. The systematic application in clinical practice of
multidimensional assessment instruments of frailty and cognitive function in the 
screening and the adoption of specific care pathways should facilitate this task.

Prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide principally
among the elderly population many of whom will eventually need renal replacement 
therapy. The relationship between frailty and CKD in the elderly population has
been recognized. However, studies concentrating on frailty in pre-dialysis
patients are limited. CKD predisposes to frailty through many potential
mechanisms; anemia, bone mineral disease, oxidative stress, and malnutrition
which in turn lead to progression of CKD culminating in a vicious cycle.
Identifying potential causes of frailty in elderly pre-dialysis patients and
recognizing individuals at risk should be an area of focus to nephrologists and
researchers. Modalities that may improve frailty in elderly pre-dialysis patients
such as treatment of anemia and bone mineral disease may improve outcome.
However, this has not been established and further research is needed. The aim of
this review is to address the importance of recognizing frailty in elderly
pre-dialysis patients using simple tools and describing its implications on
clinical outcome.

BACKGROUND: Frailty exhibits a high prevalence in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
patients and is associated with adverse health-related outcomes, including falls 
and fractures. Available studies do not address whether frailty is associated
with temporal changes in BMD. We evaluated this issue by analyzing the follow-up 
dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results in an ESRD cohort.
METHODS: In 2015, we enrolled forty-three ESRD patients, divided into frail,
pre-frail, and robust ones based on a validated simple FRAIL scale, all receiving
DXA at baseline. After one year of follow-up, survivors received another DXA, and
we calculated the absolute and percentage changes in area, bone mineral density
(BMD), T-, and Z-scores of lumbar spine and femoral neck (FN) between baseline
and follow-up examinations.
RESULTS: Among all, frail individuals with ESRD had significantly lower average
lumbar spine area, lower L4, FN, and total BMD and T-scores, lower FN and total
Z-scores than non-frail ones, without differences in gender, body mass index,
dialysis duration, and comorbidities. Furthermore, we discovered frail ESRD
patients had significantly more prominent decrease in average lumbar spine area, 
percentage changes in L1 Z-scores and average lumbar spine area, and a trend
toward more prominent decrease in L4 area than non-frail ones after one year of
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline frailty might be associated with deteriorating bone health,
including shrinking L-spine areas and a more rapid decrease in L-spine Z scores, 
among ESRD patients. This frailty-bone association should be highlighted during
our care of frail individuals with ESRD.

Prediction models for post-kidney transplantation mortality have had limited
success (C-statistics ≤0.70). Adding objective measures of potentially modifiable
factors may improve prediction and, consequently, kidney transplant (KT) survival
through intervention. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is an easily 
administered objective test of lower extremity function consisting of three parts
(balance, walking speed, chair stands), each with scores of 0-4, for a composite 
score of 0-12, with higher scores indicating better function. SPPB performance
and frailty (Fried frailty phenotype) were assessed at admission for KT in a
prospective cohort of 719 KT recipients at Johns Hopkins Hospital (8/2009 to
6/2016) and University of Michigan (2/2013 to 12/2016). The independent
associations between SPPB impairment (SPPB composite score ≤10) and composite
score with post-KT mortality were tested using adjusted competing risks models
treating graft failure as a competing risk. The 5-year posttransplantation
mortality for impaired recipients was 20.6% compared to 4.5% for unimpaired
recipients (p < 0.001). Impaired recipients had a 2.30-fold (adjusted hazard
ratio [aHR] 2.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-4.74, p = 0.02) increased
risk of postkidney transplantation mortality compared to unimpaired recipients.
Each one-point decrease in SPPB score was independently associated with a
1.19-fold (95% CI 1.09-1.30, p < 0.001) higher risk of post-KT mortality.
SPPB-derived lower extremity function is a potentially highly useful and
modifiable objective measure for pre-KT risk prediction.

Dialysis in the Elderly and Impact of Institutionalization in the United States
Renal Data System.

BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that in the very elderly dialysis patients in the
United States, institutionalization in nursing homes would increase mortality in 
addition to age alone.
METHODS: Incident dialysis patients from 2001 to 2008 above the age of 70 were
included. Patients above 70 were categorized into 4 groups according to age as
70-75, 76-80, 81-85, and >85 years and further divided into institutionalized and
noninstitutionalized. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to assess patient
survival.
RESULTS: A total of 349,440 patients were identified above the age of 70 at the
time of initiation of dialysis. For institutionalized patients, the mean survival
was significantly lower, 1.71 ± 0.03 years for those in the age range 70-75, 1.44
± 0.02 years for those in the age range 76-80, 1.25 ± 0.02 years for those in the
age range 81-85, and 1.04 ± 0.02 for those in the >85 years age group (p =
0.0001). The hazard ratio for mortality in institutionalized elderly patients on 
dialysis was 1.80 ([95% CI 1.77-1.83]; p = 0.0001). After adjustment for other
variables (multivariate Cox regression), to be institutionalized was still an
independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.57 [95% CI
1.54-1.60]; p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: There was increased mortality in institutionalized elderly patients
as compared to noninstutionalized elderly patients in the same age group. In
accordance with the increased frailty and decreased benefits of therapies in the 
very elderly, especially in those with additional co-morbidities besides age,
palliative and end-of-life care should be considered.

Systemic inflammation in end-stage renal disease is an established risk factor
for mortality and a catalyst for other complications, which are related to a
premature aging phenotype, including muscle wasting, vascular calcification, and 
other forms of premature vascular disease, depression, osteoporosis, and frailty.
Uremic inflammation is also mechanistically related to mechanisms involved in the
aging process, such as telomere shortening, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
altered nutrient sensing, which can have a direct effect on cellular and tissue
function. In addition to uremia-specific causes, such as abnormalities in the
phosphate-Klotho axis, there are remarkable similarities between the
pathophysiology of uremic inflammation and so-called "inflammaging" in the
general population. Potentially relevant, but still somewhat unexplored in this
respect, are abnormal or misplaced protein structures, as well as abnormalities
in tissue homeostasis, which evoke danger signals through damage-associated
molecular patterns, as well as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.
Systemic inflammation, in combination with the loss of kidney function, can
impair the resilience of the body to external and internal stressors by reduced
functional and structural tissue reserves, and by impairing normal organ
crosstalk, thus providing an explanation for the greatly increased risk of
homeostatic breakdown in this population. In this review, the relationship
between uremic inflammation and a premature aging phenotype, as well as potential
causes and consequences, are discussed.

Renal disease is a common health condition that leads to loss of physical
function, frailty, and premature loss of independence in addition to other severe
comorbidities and increased mortality. Increased levels of physical activity and 
initiation of exercise training is recommended in the current guidelines for all 
patients with renal disease, but participation and adherence rates are low. The
barriers to exercise and physical activity in patients with renal disease are not
well defined and currently based on patient provider perception and opinion.
There have been no published reviews that have synthesized published findings on 
patient reported barriers to exercise. This integrative literature review
therefore aimed to identify the current understanding of patient reported
barriers to regular exercise. This integrative review found that patient
perceived barriers to exercise are not consistent with the barriers that have
been identified by renal disease specialists and healthcare providers, which were
disinterest, lack of motivation, and being incapable of exercise. The patient
reported barriers identified through this review were complex and diverse, and
the most frequently reported patient perceived barrier to exercise was low energy
levels and fatigue. It is clear that additional research to identify patient
perceived barriers to exercise is needed and that patient directed interventions 
to address these barriers should be developed. This integrative review provides
information to the interdisciplinary nephrology team that can be used to tailor
their assessment of barriers to exercise and provide exercise education for
patients with renal disease.

BACKGROUND: Predicting outcomes in those with chronic kidney disease or following
transplantation is challenging, and current models lack detailed patient-level
information. Frailty and poor functional status are risk factors for adverse
patient outcomes that may be useful additions to prognostic tools in patients
with chronic kidney disease. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine 
whether frailty or functional status are associated with increased risk of
mortality or adverse clinical outcomes in patients with advanced kidney disease.
METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a systematic review to identify and evaluate
studies linking frailty and functional status with patient outcomes in
populations with advanced kidney disease. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, and the
Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials. Two reviewers will conduct all
screening and data extraction independently. A modified version of the Quality In
Prognosis Studies tool will be used to evaluate the quality of the studies. If
meta-analysis of outcome data is possible, a random effects model will be used.
DISCUSSION: The results of this review will inform the development, selection,
and validation of appropriate metrics needed to improve prognostication in
patients with chronic kidney disease.

It is often of interest to compare centers or healthcare providers on quality of 
care delivered. We consider the setting where evaluation of center performance on
multiple competing events is of interest. We propose estimating center effects
through cause-specific proportional hazards frailty models that allow correlation
among a center's cause-specific effects. Estimation of our model proceeds via
penalized partial likelihood and is implemented in R. To evaluate center
performance, we also propose a directly standardized excess cumulative incidence 
(ECI) measure. Therefore, based on our proposed methods, practitioners can
evaluate centers either through the cause-specific hazards or the cumulative
incidence functions. We demonstrate, through simulations, the advantages of the
proposed methods to detect outlying centers, by comparing the proposed methods
and existing methods which assume uncorrelated random center effects. In
addition, we develop a Correlation Score Test to test the null hypothesis that
the competing event processes within a center are correlated. Using data from the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we apply our method to evaluate the
performance of Organ Procurement Organizations on two competing risks: (i)
receipt of a kidney transplant and (ii) death on the wait-list.

BACKGROUND: Physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning are frequently
impaired in dialysis patients and impairment in these domains relates to poor
outcome. The aim of this analysis was to compare the prevalence of impairment as 
measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life- Short Form (KDQOL-SF) subscales
between the different age categories and to assess whether the association of
these subscales with mortality differs between younger and older dialysis
patients.
METHODS: This study included data from 714 prevalent hemodialysis patients, from 
26 centres, who were enrolled in the CONvective TRAnsport STudy (CONTRAST
NCT00205556, 09-12-2005). Baseline HRQOL domains were evaluated for patients
<65 years, 65-74 years and over 75 years. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards 
analyses were performed to assess the relation between the separate domains and
2-year mortality.
RESULTS: Emotional health was higher in patients over the age of 75 compared to
younger patients (mean level 71, 73 and 77 for increasing age categories
respectively, p = 0.02), whilst physical functioning was significantly lower in
older patients (mean level 60, 48 and 40, p < 0.01). A low level of physical
functioning (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.72 [95%Confidence Interval (CI) 1.02-2.73]),
emotional health (HR 1.85 [95% 1.30-2.63]), and social functioning (HR 1.59 [95% 
CI 1.12-2.26]), was individually associated with an increased 2-year mortality
within the whole population. The absence of effect modification suggests no
evidence for different relations within the older age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In dialysis patients, older age is associated with lower levels of
physical functioning, whilst the level of emotional health is not associated with
age. KDQOL-SF domains physical functioning, emotional health and social
functioning are independently associated with mortality in prevalent younger and 
older hemodialysis patients.

Intentional weight loss is an important treatment option for overweight persons
with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), but the effects on long-term fracture risk
are not known. The purpose of this Look AHEAD analysis was to evaluate whether
long-term intentional weight loss would increase fracture risk in overweight or
obese persons with DM. Look AHEAD is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial.
Recruitment began in August 2001 and follow-up continued for a median of 11.3
years at 16 academic centers. A total of 5145 persons aged 45 to 76 years with DM
were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) with reduced 
calorie consumption and increased physical activity designed to achieve and
maintain ≥7% weight loss or to diabetes support and education intervention (DSE).
Incident fractures were ascertained every 6 months by self-report and confirmed
with central adjudication of medical records. The baseline mean age of
participants was 59 years, 60% were women, 63% were white, and the mean BMI was
36 kg/m2 . Weight loss over the intervention period (median 9.6 years) was 6.0%
in ILI and 3.5% in DSE. A total of 731 participants had a confirmed incident
fracture (358 in DSE versus 373 in ILI). There were no statistically significant 
differences in incident total or hip fracture rates between the ILI and DSE
groups. However, compared to the DSE group, the ILI group had a statistically
significant 39% increased risk of a frailty fracture (HR 1.39; 95% CI, 1.02 to
1.89). An intensive lifestyle intervention resulting in long-term weight loss in 
overweight/obese adults with DM was not associated with an overall increased risk
of incident fracture but may be associated with an increased risk of frailty
fracture. When intentional weight loss is planned, consideration of bone
preservation and fracture prevention is warranted. © 2017 American Society for

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Technique failure is a major limitation of peritoneal 
dialysis. Our study aimed to identify center- and patient-level predictors of
peritoneal dialysis technique failure.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All patients on incident
peritoneal dialysis in Australia from 2004 to 2014 were included in the study
using data from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry.
Center- and patient-level characteristics associated with technique failure were 
evaluated using Cox shared frailty models. Death-censored technique failure and
cause-specific technique failure were analyzed as secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: The study included 9362 patients from 51 centers in Australia. The
technique failure rate was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.36) episodes 
per patient-year, with a sevenfold variation across centers that was mainly
associated with center-level characteristics. Technique failure was significantly
less likely in centers with larger proportions of patients treated with
peritoneal dialysis (>29%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 
0.73 to 0.94) and more likely in smaller centers (<16 new patients per year;
adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.21) and centers
with lower proportions of patients achieving target baseline serum phosphate
levels (<40%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to
1.29). Similar results were observed for death-censored technique failure, except
that center target phosphate achievement was not significantly associated.
Technique failure due to infection, social reasons, mechanical causes, or death
was variably associated with center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal
dialysis, and/or target phosphate achievement, automated peritoneal dialysis
exposure, icodextrin use, and antifungal use. The variation of hazards of
technique failure across centers was reduced by 28% after adjusting for
patient-specific factors and an additional 53% after adding center-specific
factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Technique failure varies widely across centers in Australia. A
significant proportion of this variation is related to potentially modifiable
center characteristics, including peritoneal dialysis center size, proportion of 
patients on peritoneal dialysis, and proportion of patients on peritoneal
dialysis achieving target phosphate level.

INTRODUCTION: This article ponders upon wearable medical measurement devices in
relation to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and its' associated comorbidities - and 
whether these might benefit CKD-patients. We aimed to map the intersection(s) of 
nephrology and wearable sensor technology to help technologists understand
medical aspects, and clinicians to understand technological possibilities that
are available (or soon will become so). Areas covered: A structured literature
search on main comorbidities and complications CKD patients suffer from, was used
to steer mini-reviews on wearable sensor technologies clustered around 3 themes
being: Cardiovascular-related, diabetes-related and physical fitness/frailty.
This review excludes wearable dialysis - although also strongly enabled by
miniaturization - because that highly important theme deserves separate in-depth 
reviewing. Expert commentary: Continuous progress in integrated electronics
miniaturization enormously lowered price, size, weight and energy consumption of 
electronic sensors, processing power, memory and wireless connectivity. These
combined factors boost opportunities for wearable medical sensors. Such devices
can be regarded as enablers for: Remote monitoring, influencing human behaviour
(exercise, dietary), enhanced home care, remote consults, patient education and
peer networks. However, to make wearable medical devices succeed, the challenge
to fit them into health care structures will be dominant over the challenge to
realize the bare technologies themselves.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common among patients on hemodialysis and
associated with adverse outcomes. However, little is known about changes in
frailty over time and the factors associated with those changes.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: To address these questions, we
examined 762 participants in the A Cohort to Investigate the Value of
Exercise/Analyses Designed to Investigate the Paradox of Obesity and Survival in 
ESRD cohort study, among whom frailty was assessed at baseline and 12 and 24
months. We used ordinal generalized estimating equations analyses and modeled
frailty (on a scale from zero to five possible components) and death during
follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean frailty score at baseline was 1.9, and the distribution of
frailty scores was similar at each evaluation. However, most participants' scores
changed, with patients improving almost as often as worsening (overall change,
0.2 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.3). Hispanic ethnicity
(0.6 points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.0 to 1.1) and diabetes (0.7
points per year; 95% confidence interval, 0.3 to 1.0) were associated with higher
frailty scores and higher serum albumin concentration with lower frailty scores
(-1.1 points per g/dl; 95% confidence interval, -1.5 to -0.7). In addition,
patients whose serum albumin increased over time were less likely to become
frail, with each 1-g/dl increase in albumin associated with a 0.4-point reduction
in frailty score (95% confidence interval, -0.80 to -0.05). To examine the
underpinnings of the association between serum albumin and frailty, we included
serum IL-6, normalized protein catabolic rate, and patient self-report of
hospitalization within the last year in a second model. Higher IL-6 and
hospitalization were statistically significantly associated with worse frailty at
any point and worsening frailty over time, whereas normalized protein catabolic
rate was not independently associated with frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: There was substantial year to year variability in frailty scores,
with approximately equal numbers of patients improving and worsening. Markers of 
inflammation and hospitalization were independently associated with worsening
frailty. Studies should examine whether interventions to address inflammation or 
posthospitalization rehabilitation can improve the trajectory of frailty.

Many patients become frail with diminished cardiorespiratory fitness while
awaiting kidney transplantation. Frailty and poor fitness powerfully predict
mortality, transplant graft survival, and healthcare utilization after kidney
transplantation. Efforts to intervene with post-transplant physical therapy have 
been met with limited success, in large part due to high study dropout. We
reviewed the literature on chronic kidney disease and exercise to propose a
clinical framework for physical therapy interventions to improve fitness,
scheduled for before the transplant. This framework may lead to better patient
retention and compliance, and thus demonstrate better efficacy in mitigating the 
effects of frailty and poor fitness after kidney transplantation.

Frailty is a common complication in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) under dialysis, which is a strong risk factor for low quality of life,
morbidity, and mortality. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of
frailty in a group of Portuguese ESRD patients, and its association with
socio-demographic, clinical and biochemical markers. We performed a
cross-sectional study with 83 ESRD patients (44 males and 39 females, 64.3
[±14.6] years old) on regular dialysis. The classification of the ESRD patients
as robust, pre-frail and frail was performed using the FRAIL questionnaire.
Social support, data about sociodemographic and comorbidities, and
haematological, iron status, dialysis adequacy, nutritional and inflammatory
markers were also evaluated. Our results confirmed that frailty is a highly
prevalent condition in ESRD patients, particularly in female patients. An
association between FRAIL score and increased depressive symptoms, presence of
hypertension and decrease nutritional status was also found.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is a common condition in patients with severe aortic stenosis 
(AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The aim of this
systematic review was to assess the impact of frailty status on acute kidney
injury (AKI) and mortality after TAVR.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 
Cochrane databases from the inception through November 2016. The protocol for
this study is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42016052350). Studies that reported odds ratios,
relative risks or hazard ratios comparing the risk of AKI after TAVR in frail vs.
non-frail patients were included. Mortality risk was evaluated among the studies 
that reported AKI-related outcomes. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence
interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance
method.
RESULTS: Eight cohort studies with a total of 10,498 patients were identified and
included in the meta-analysis. The pooled RR of AKI after TAVR among the frail
patients was 1.19 (95% CI 0.97-1.46, I2 = 0), compared with non-frail patients.
When the meta-analysis was restricted only to studies with standardized AKI
diagnosis according to Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 criteria, the 
pooled RRs of AKI in frail patients was 1.16 (95% CI 0.91-1.47, I2 = 0). Within
the selected studies, frailty status was significantly associated with increased 
mortality (RR 2.01; 95% CI 1.44-2.80, I2 = 58).
CONCLUSION: The findings from our study suggest no significant association
between frailty status and AKI after TAVR. However, frailty status is associated 
with mortality after TAVR and may aid appropriate patient selection for TAVR.

BACKGROUND: Survival for patients commencing renal replacement therapy is around 
90% in the first year and 83% at two years after starting dialysis. The factors
that appear to predict mortality are comorbidity and frailty associated with
kidney disease, glomerular filtration rate, age and biochemical factors.
OBJECTIVES: To analyse the condition of patients starting renal replacement
therapy, based on biomarkers commonly used in clinical practice and their
association with mortality, measured 6 and 12 months after initiating replacement
therapy.
METHODS: A one-year prospective follow-up study with 189 patients.
Sociodemographic variables, aetiology of renal disease, comorbidities, prior
nephrology service monitoring, prior renal transplantation and biochemical
parameters at the time of initiating replacement therapy were analysed.
RESULTS: The overall percentage of death during the one-year follow-up was 6.87%,
with 64% of deaths occurring during the first six months. The only variable
independently associated with mortality was low albumin levels.
CONCLUSION: Although most patients in this centre are monitored by a nephrologist
prior to starting replacement therapy, many nevertheless fail to achieve the
biochemical targets recommended. One such parameter is albumin, which proved at
the start of replacement therapy to be an independent predictor of mortality.
Findings of this study show the need to intervene on certain biochemical
parameters during the pre-dialysis stage and at the start of dialysis, in order
to improve survival in this group of patients.

BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the
general population and adults with chronic diseases. However, it is unclear
whether periodontitis predicts survival in the setting of kidney failure.
METHODS: ORAL-D was a propensity matched analysis in 3338 dentate adults with
end-stage kidney disease treated in a hemodialysis network in Europe and South
America designed to examine the association between periodontitis and all-cause
and cardiovascular-related mortality in people on long-term hemodialysis.
Participants were matched 1:1 on their propensity score for moderate to severe
periodontitis assessed using the World Health Organization Community Periodontal 
Index. A random-effects Cox proportional hazards model was fitted with shared
frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within countries.
RESULTS: Among the 3338 dentate participants, 1355 (40.6%) had moderate to severe
periodontitis at baseline. After using propensity score methods to generate a
matched cohort of participants with periodontitis similar to those with none or
mild periodontal disease, moderate to severe periodontitis was associated with a 
lower risk of all-cause (9.1 versus 13.0 per 100 person years, hazard ratio 0.74,
95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.90) and cardiovascular (4.3 versus 6.9 per 100 
person years, hazard ratio 0.67, 0.51 to 0.88) mortality. These associations were
not changed substantially when participants were limited to those with 12 or more
natural teeth and when accounting for competing causes of cardiovascular death.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to the general population, periodontitis does not appear 
to be associated with an increased risk of early death in adults treated with
hemodialysis.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Little is known about factors that predispose older
adults to poor recovery after a stroke. In this study, we sought to evaluate
prestroke measures of frailty and related factors as markers of vulnerability to 
poor outcomes after ischemic stroke.
METHODS: In participants aged 65 to 99 years with incident ischemic strokes from 
the Cardiovascular Health Study, we evaluated the association of several risk
factors (frailty, frailty components, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and
cystatin C) assessed before stroke with stroke outcomes of survival, cognitive
decline (≥5 points on Modified Mini-Mental State Examination), and activities of 
daily living decline (increase in limitations).
RESULTS: Among 717 participants with incident ischemic stroke with survival data,
slow walking speed, low grip strength, and cystatin C were independently
associated with shorter survival. Among participants <80 years of age, frailty
and interleukin-6 were also associated with shorter survival. Among 509
participants with recovery data, slow walking speed, and low grip strength were
associated with both cognitive and activities of daily living decline poststroke.
C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were associated with poststroke cognitive
decline among men only. Frailty status was associated with activities of daily
living decline among women only.
CONCLUSIONS: Markers of physical function-walking speed and grip strength-were
consistently associated with survival and recovery after ischemic stroke.
Inflammation, kidney function, and frailty also seemed to be determinants of
survival and recovery after an ischemic stroke. These markers of vulnerability
may identify targets for differing pre and poststroke medical management and
rehabilitation among older adults at risk of poor stroke outcomes.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is considered a model of accelerated aging. More
specifically, CKD leads to reduced physical functioning and increased frailty,
increased vascular dysfunction, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness,
high levels of systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as increased 
cognitive impairment. Increasing evidence suggests that the cognitive impairment 
associated with CKD may be related to cerebral small vessel disease and overall
impairment in white matter integrity. The triad of poor physical function,
vascular dysfunction, and cognitive impairment places patients living with CKD at
an increased risk for loss of independence, poor health-related quality of life, 
morbidity, and mortality. The purpose of this review is to discuss the available 
evidence of cerebrovascular-renal axis and its interconnection with early and
accelerated cognitive impairment in patients with CKD and the plausible role of
exercise as a therapeutic modality. Understanding the cerebrovascular-renal axis 
pathophysiological link and its interconnection with physical function is
important for clinicians in order to minimize the risk of loss of independence
and improve quality of life in patients with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients on dialysis and
is traditionally measured using tools that assess physical impairment. Alternate 
measurement tools highlight cognitive and functional domains, requiring
clinician, patient, and/or caregiver input. In this study, we compared frailty
measures for incident dialysis patients that incorporate patient, clinician, and 
caregiver perspectives with an aim to contrast the measured prevalence of frailty
using tools derived from different conceptual frameworks.
METHODS: A prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients was conducted
between February 2014 and June 2015. Frailty was assessed at dialysis onset
using: 1) modified definition of Fried Phenotype (Dialysis Morbidity Mortality
Study definition, DMMS); 2) Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS); 3) Frailty Assessment
Care Planning Tool (provides CFS grading, FACT-CFS); and 4) Frailty Index (FI).
Measures were compared via correlation and sensitivity/specificity analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 98 patients participated (mean age of 61 ± 14 years).
Participants were primarily Caucasian (91%), male (58%), and the majority started
on hemodialysis (83%). The median score for both the CFS and FACT-CFS was 4
(interquartile range of 3-5). The mean FI score was 0.31 (standard
deviation ± 0.16). The DMMS identified 78% of patients as frail. The FACT-CFS
demonstrated highest correlation (r = 0.71) with the FI, while the DMMS was most 
sensitive (97%, 100%) and a CFS ≥ 5 most specific (100%, 77%) at corresponding FI
cutoff values (>0.21, >0.45).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessments of incident dialysis patients that include
clinician, caregiver and patient perspectives have moderate to strong correlation
with the FI. At specified FI cutoff values, the FACT-CFS and DMMS are highly
sensitive measures of frailty. The CFS and FACT-CFS may represent viable
alternative screening tools in dialysis patients.

Patients with chronic kidney disease experience substantial loss of muscle mass, 
weakness, and poor physical performance. As kidney disease progresses, skeletal
muscle dysfunction forms a common pathway for mobility limitation, loss of
functional independence, and vulnerability to disease complications. Screening
for those at high risk for mobility disability by self-reported and objective
measures of function is an essential first step in developing an
interdisciplinary approach to treatment that includes rehabilitative therapies
and counseling on physical activity. Exercise has beneficial effects on systemic 
inflammation, muscle, and physical performance in chronic kidney disease. Kidney 
health providers need to identify patient and care delivery barriers to exercise 
in order to effectively counsel patients on physical activity. A thorough medical
evaluation and assessment of baseline function using self-reported and objective 
function assessment is essential to guide an effective individualized exercise
prescription to prevent function decline in persons with kidney disease. This
review focuses on the impact of kidney disease on skeletal muscle dysfunction in 
the context of the disablement process and reviews screening and treatment
strategies that kidney health professionals can use in clinical practice to
prevent functional decline and disability.

Frailty is a distinct phenotype that is highly prevalent in chronic kidney
disease (CKD) and appears to be more prevalent with decreasing glomerular
filtration rate. Exercise training or intervention to increase physical activity 
may ameliorate poor physical functioning and frailty, and even may improve
survival in patients with CKD. Although exercise interventions improve outcomes
across the spectrum of CKD, including patients treated with dialysis, patients
treated with dialysis face barriers to exercise that patients with predialysis
CKD do not. Rehabilitation at earlier stages of CKD (or prehabilitation before
dialysis) might be more beneficial than not addressing the decreasing physical
functioning and low physical activity until patients are receiving dialysis. This
review summarizes available literature on frailty in the CKD and end-stage renal 
disease population, including exercise interventions and the limited evidence for
prehabilitation as a strategy.

BACKGROUND: The risk of incorrect medication dosing is high in frail older
people. Therefore, accurate assessment of the glomerular filtration rate is
important.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the estimated glomerular
filtration rate using creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae, the Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, in frail older
people. We hypothesized that frailty determines the difference between the
creatinine- and cystatin C-based formulae.
METHODS: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C was
determined using (cross-sectional) data of 55 patients (mean age 73 years)
admitted to a psychiatric ward for older adults. The level of agreement of these 
estimations was assessed by a Bland-Altman analysis. In all patients, the
Rockwood's Frailty Index was derived and correlated with the mean difference
between CKD-EPI creatinine and cystatin C.
RESULTS: The mean difference between CKD-EPI creatinine (mean
71.2 mL/min/1.73 m2) and CKD-EPI cystatin C (mean 57.6 mL/min/1.73 m2) was
13.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.0001). The two standard deviation limit in the
Bland-Altman plot was large (43.2 mL/min/1.73 m2), which represents a low level
of agreement. The Frailty Index did not correlate with the mean difference
between the creatinine- and cystatin C-based glomerular filtration rate (Pearson 
correlation coefficient 0.182, p = 0.184).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant gap between a creatinine- and cystatin
C-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate, irrespective of frailty. The
range of differences between the commonly used estimated glomerular filtration
rate formulae might result in clinically relevant differences in drug
prescription and differences in chronic kidney disease staging.

OBJECTIVE: Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized 
loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, with the risk of frailty and poor
quality of life. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of
sarcopenia and to investigate the effects of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation
(CCR), including nutrition, physical exercise and medication, in patients with
cardiovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 322 inpatients with CVD (age 72±12 years).
Muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance were assessed before and
after exercise training in patients with and without sarcopenia, which was
defined as either a gait speed of <0.8 m/s or reduced handgrip strength (<26 kg
in males and <18 kg in females), together with lower skeletal muscle index (SMI) 
(<7.0 kg/m2 in males and <5.7 kg/m2 in females). The actual daily total calorie
and nutrient intake was also calculated.
RESULTS: Sarcopenia was identified in 28% of patients with CVD, these patients
having a higher prevalence of symptomatic chronic heart failure and chronic
kidney disease. SMI was significantly associated with protein intake and statin
treatment. The ratio of peak VO2 and SMI was significantly higher in the statin
treatment group. Handgrip strength, gait speed, leg weight bearing index, and
nutritional intake improved after exercise training in patients both with and
without sarcopenia.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that CCR is a promising strategy for
prevention and treatment of sarcopenia in patients with CVD.

Background: The burden of chronic kidney disease is highest among older adults
but the significance of a diminished level of kidney function in this
heterogeneous population is poorly understood. We sought to examine the
relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and objective
physical performance in older adults.
Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of 4,562 participants from The Irish
Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a national cohort of community-dwelling adults aged
≥50 years. We used multivariable linear or quantile regression to model the
association between categories of cystatin C (eGFRcys) or creatinine eGFR
(eGFRcr) and the following outcomes: gait speed, timed-up-and-go (TUG) and grip
strength. Relationships were further explored using natural eGFR splines. We
examined effect modification by age in the relationship between eGFR and gait
speed.
Results: Mean (SD) age was 61.8 (8.3) years, 53.6% were female and median (IQR)
eGFRcys was 82 (70-94) mL/min/1.73m2. In multivariable-adjusted models,
participants in the lowest eGFRcys category (< 45 mL/min/1.73m2) had 3.32 cm/s
(95% confidence interval [95%CI] 0.02-6.62) slower mean gait speed, 1.32 kg
(95%CI 0.20-2.44) lower mean grip strength, and 0.31 seconds (95% CI -0.04 to
0.65) longer median TUG versus the reference group (eGFRcys ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73m2). 
The relationship between eGFRcys and outcomes appeared linear but varied by age. 
The association between eGFRcr and outcomes tended towards a U-shape.
Conclusions: Cystatin C eGFR was linearly related to poorer physical performance 
beyond middle age among community-dwelling adults. The non-linear relationships
observed with eGFRcr underscore the limitations of creatinine as a predictor of
frailty outcomes in older individuals.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) with
subsequent investigation of healthcare patterns in older patients with urological
cancers undergoing initial surgery or radiotherapy, to verify the usefulness of
the incorporation of geriatric principles in future care plans.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study. From November 2011 to
March 2015, CGA was offered to all patients aged 70+ years treated with
radiotherapy or surgery at seven tertiary centers. Patients were classified as
fit, vulnerable, or frail according to Balducci's definition. CGA and follow-up
data were collected by two trained evaluators at 6 and 12months. The information 
collected was not available to the caring physicians during follow-up.
RESULTS: CGA was performed in 453 patients with prostate cancer (295), bladder
cancer (126), or kidney cancer (32). 40% of patients with prostate cancer were
fit, 47% vulnerable, and 13% frail. The corresponding values for renal cancer
were 25%, 40%, and 34%, and for bladder cancer, 21%, 42%, and 37%. During
follow-up, 60% of patients with cardiac diseases, 42% of those with
diabetes/other metabolic disorders, 35% of those with hypertension, and 35% of
those with respiratory diseases were followed by a specialist (for these
severe/extremely severe comorbidities). Of 16 patients with ADL impairment and 63
with IADL impairment, only 4 (25%) and 6 (10%), respectively, were referred to a 
rehabilitation service. Only one case was referred to a geriatrician.
CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate clinical care patterns are advisable to improve quality 
of survivorship in older patients with urological cancers.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review and
meta-analysis on prevalence of frailty among patients with end-stage renal
disease (ESRD). ESRD is associated with malnutrition, chronic inflammation,
acidemia, impaired hormonal changes, and low physical activity, all of which can 
directly and indirectly contribute to the development of frailty. Coexistence of 
ESRD and frailty has been shown to increase risks of adverse health outcomes.
Given potential reversibility of frailty, it is important to examine frailty
status in this high-risk population.
METHODS: Three databases (EMBASE, Medline, and CINAHL) were systematically
searched for studies providing cross-sectional data of prevalence of frailty
defined by cardiovascular health study (CHS) criteria among ESRD patients.
Meta-analysis calculated pooled prevalence of frailty according to modifications 
of CHS criteria.
RESULTS: Of 837 studies identified through the systematic review, seven studies
were included. Three studies used both objectively measured and self-reported CHS
criteria, and two studies each used only either criteria. Pooled prevalence of
frailty was 36.8% (five studies: 95% CI = 29.9-44.1%, I 2 = 82.6%, p < 0.001) and
67.0% (five studies: 95% CI = 58.7-74.7%, I 2 = 96.5%, p < 0.001) according to
the objectively measured and self-reported CHS criteria, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of ESRD patients were frail based on the
objectively measured CHS criteria, and that prevalence of frailty almost doubled 
with the CHS criteria substituting self-reported physical function questionnaire 
score for objective measurements. Given substantial difference in prevalence of
frailty depending on the modifications to CHS criteria, this information should
be taken into account when evaluating frailty status among ESRD population.

Aging and Alzheimer is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study involving 2944
adults aged ≥65 years from selected areas in Cuba's Havana and Matanzas
Provinces. This door-to-door study, which began in 2003, includes periodic
assessments of the cohort based on an interview; physical exam; anthropometric
measurements; and diagnosis of dementia and its subtypes, other mental disorders,
and other chronic non-communicable diseases and their risk factors. Information
was gathered on sociodemographic characteristics; disability, dependency and
frailty; use of health services; and characteristics of care and caregiver
burden. The first assessment also included blood tests: complete blood count,
blood glucose, kidney and liver function, lipid profile and ApoE4 genotype (a
susceptibility marker). In 2007-2011, the second assessment was done of 2010
study subjects aged ≥65 years who were still alive. The study provides data on
prevalence and incidence of dementia and its risk factors, and of related
conditions that affect the health of older adults. It also contributes valuable
experiences from field work and interactions with older adults and their
families. Building on lessons learned, a third assessment to be done in 2016-2018
will incorporate a community intervention strategy to respond to diseases and
conditions that predispose to dementia, frailty and dependency in older adults.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this article, we review sarcopenia in chronic kidney
disease (CKD). We aim to present how definitions of sarcopenia from the general
population may pertain to those with CKD, its assessment by clinicians and
emerging therapies for sarcopenia in CKD. For this review, we limit our
description and recommendations to patients with CKD who are not on dialysis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Poorer parameters of lean mass, strength and physical function
are associated with worsening patient-centered outcomes such as limiting
mobility, falls and mortality in CKD; however, the magnitude of these
associations are different in those with and without CKD. Sarcopenia in CKD is a 
balance between skeletal muscle regeneration and catabolism, which are both
altered in the uremic environment. Multiple pathways are involved in these
derangements, which are briefly reviewed. Differences between commonly used terms
cachexia, frailty, protein-energy wasting, dynapenia and sarcopenia are
described. Therapeutic options in predialysis CKD are not well studied;
therefore, we review exercise options and emerging pharmacological therapies.
SUMMARY: Sarcopenia, now with its own International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision (ICD-10) code, is of importance clinically and should be accounted 
for in research studies in patients with CKD. Multiple therapies for sarcopenia
are in development and will hopefully be available for our patients in the
future.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older kidney transplant recipients are susceptible to 
cognitive impairment, frailty, comorbidities, immunosuppression-related
complications, and chronic graft failure, however, there has been limited focus
on their concerns and expectations related to transplantation. This study aims to
describe the perspectives of older kidney transplant recipients about their
experience of kidney transplantation, self-management, and treatment goals to
inform strategies and interventions that address their specific needs.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Face-to-face semistructured
interviews were conducted with 30 kidney transplant recipients aged 65-80 years
from five renal units in Australia. Transcripts were analyzed thematically.
RESULTS: Six themes were identified: restoring vitality of youth (with subthemes 
of revived mindset for resilience, embracing enjoyment in life, drive for
self-actualization); persisting through prolonged recovery (yielding to aging,
accepting functional limitations, pushing the limit, enduring treatment
responsibilities); imposing sicknesses (combatting devastating comorbidities,
painful restrictions, emerging disillusionment, anxieties about accumulating side
effects, consuming treatment burden); prioritizing graft survival (privileged
with a miracle, negotiating risks for longevity, enacting a moral duty,
preserving the last opportunity); confronting health deterioration (vulnerability
and helplessness, narrowing focus to immediate concerns, uncertainty of
survival); and value of existence (purpose through autonomy, refusing the burden 
of futile treatment, staying alive by all means).
CONCLUSIONS: Older kidney transplant recipients felt able to enjoy life and
strived to live at their newly re-established potential and capability, which
motivated them to protect their graft. However, some felt constrained by slow
recuperation and overwhelmed by unexpected comorbidities, medication-related side
effects, and health decline. Our findings suggest the need to prepare and support
older recipients for self-management responsibilities, clarify their expectations
of post-transplant risks and outcomes, and provide assistance through prolonged
recovery after kidney transplantation.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether higher serum β2 -microglobulin (B2M) levels, a
kidney function marker, are associated with prevalent and incident frailty in
community-dwelling older women.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of a prospective cohort.
SETTING: Population-based cohort study in Tokyo, Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling women aged 75 and older with adequate data for
assessing frailty status (N = 1,191) and a subset of participants without
baseline frailty but with repeated frailty assessment at 2 and 4 years of
follow-up.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary predictor was B2M level. Outcomes were prevalent and
incident frailty during the 4-year follow-up period. Frailty was defined as
presence of three of the five Fried criteria: weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, 
slowness, and low physical activity. Adjusted odds ratios for the main
confounders were obtained using logistic regression. Discrete-time Cox
proportional hazards models were used to determine the risk of developing
frailty.
RESULTS: The study included 241 (20.2%) women with prevalent frailty at baseline 
and 139 (21.1%) with incident frailty during the 4-year follow-up. On
multivariate analysis adjusted for multiple potential confounders, the odds of
prevalent frailty were 2.5 times as great with B2M levels of 1.9 to 2.1 mg/L as
with levels less than 1.6 mg/L and 2.0 times as great with B2M levels of 2.2 mg/L
or more. In the unadjusted model, B2M levels of 1.9 to 2.1 mg/L were associated
with a greater incidence of frailty than B2M levels of less than 1.6 mg/L (hazard
ratio = 1.72, 95% confidence interval = 1.04-2.86). In the multivariate analysis 
adjusted for potential confounders, no significant association was noted between 
the highest B2M quartile and incident frailty.
CONCLUSION: Higher B2M levels were independently associated with greater frailty 
at baseline in older adults but only slightly associated with greater risk of
incident frailty over 4 years of follow-up.

Nursing home care. Daily HHD vs conventional dialysis: A survival comparison.

Yang A, Lee A, Hocking K.

Patients that dialyze in the nursing home setting are known to be an especially
at-risk vulnerable population compared to the overall ESRD population. This is
likely due to the nursing home dialysis patients' advanced age, multiple
co-morbidities, and frailty, requiring skilled nursing support. These challenges 
often result in worse outcomes compared to the overall end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) population but few studies have investigated interventions to improve
health outcomes in this population. Previously, we reported results from a study 
using a large epidemiological database of patients from an independent nursing
home dialysis provider, showing that patients treated with daily home
hemodialysis had improved outcomes compared to patients treated with conventional
dialysis. One limitation of the previous study was that the timeframe for the two
comparison groups was different; therefore, the results could have been due to
over-all improvements in care over time unrelated to the modality of dialysis: To
address this as well as expand on the previous analysis, the objective of the
present study was to compare outcomes in ESRD patients in the nursing home
setting treated with daily home hemodialysis versus con- ventional
three-day-a-week (TIW) hemodialysis using an updated database, specifically
assessing patients treated during a concurrent time: frame. Health status was
evaluated for 6,314 patients (n=4,778 conventional, n=1,902 daily home
hemodialysis; 2006 to November 2015 for conventional; 2011 to November 2015 for
daily home hemodialysis). Analyses included monthly mortality rates, Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis, and laboratory values. In the "Compared to the conventional
dialysis population, daily HHD patients had similar or lower incident mortality
rates." analysis of patients treated during the concurrent timeframe, median
overall survival was 36 months with daily home hemodialysis versus 21 months with
conventional dialysis (P=0.0025). These results were similar to the analysis of
all patients regardless of timeframe. Compared to the conventional dialysis
population, daily home hemodialysis patients had similar or lower incident
mortality rates. Survival rates were higher at 3 months (89% vs 82%), 6 months
(84% vs 73%), and 12 months (74% vs 62%) in the daily home hemodialy- sis
population compared to conventional dialysis population. Monthly mean albumin was
consistent over time in the daily home hemodialysis population but gradually
increased in the conventional dialysis population. Hemoglobin values were
consistently lower over the follow-up period in the daily home hemodialysis
population and ferritin values were similar in both populations. These results
confirm and extend previous findings that daily home hemodialysis is associated
with improved patient outcomes compared to conventional hemodialysis. Although
difficult to conduct practically, a prospective randomized outcomes study
evaluating daily home hemodialysis versus conventional TIW dialysis would be
valuable in informing the standard of dialysis care in this population.

The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT; ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT01206062) was stopped early because of significantly lower risk of
cardiovascular disease in participants randomized to a systolic blood pressure
target of 120 mmHg (intensive) than in those randomized to 140 mmHg (standard).
The cardiovascular outcome benefit was also identified in subjects aged 75 and
older assigned to the intensive arm-34% lower than in the standard arm-in
addition to 33% lower all-cause mortality at 3.14 years of follow-up. These
beneficial outcomes held in older participants characterized as frail or with
impaired gait speed. This article addresses several questions that need to be
considered in applying the SPRINT results to the clinical care of older adults:
Why are the SPRINT results discordant from those of epidemiological studies? Do
the SPRINT findings generalize to the frail, older adults that I care for? Were
there more adverse events in the intensive treatment group? What about cognitive 
and kidney outcomes? What are future considerations, and how low should we go?

This is a prospective cohort study to assess the prevalence of frailty in
patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) under the government-funded
scheme at our center and to assess the relationship between frailty and falls,
hospitalizations, and mortality. This was done at our center which is completely 
supported by the government, which provides HD to all the patients under poverty 
line. Epidemiological data, anthropometric measurements, comorbidities
assessment, frailty assessment using Fried criteria, subsequent hospitalizations,
falls, and mortality were recorded in our prevalent dialysis population at our
center between October 2014 and October 2015. Two hundred and twenty-six patients
were enrolled during this period. Twenty-one patients were excluded as they did
not satisfy the inclusion criteria. Two hundred and five prospective patients
were studied for the predictors of frailty. Frailty was present in 82% of the
study population. Mean age of our study population was 44.95 ± 13.27 years. On
univariate analysis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (HTN), cerebrovascular
accident (CVA), left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), peripheral vascular disease
(PVD), smoking, hepatitis C, inadequate dialysis, intradialytic hypotension
(IDH), interdialytic weight gain, low serum creatinine <4 mg/dL, and anemia (Hb
<10 g/dL) were found to be statistically significantly different between frail
and nonfrail groups On multivariate regression analysis, only HTN, PVD, CVA,
anemia, smoking, and IDH were found to be significant. Frailty is highly
prevalent among dialysis population. Factors predicting frailty include HTN,
smoking, LVD, PVD, CVA, smoking, anemia, and IDH. Frailty is a significant risk
factor for falls and hospitalizations.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical implications of frailty in chronic kidney 
disease patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and chronic peritoneal
dialysis.
DESIGN: In this prospective study, all of the participants completed the Short
Form of the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire, Korean version, to
determine their frailty phenotype. We also obtained blood chemistry and
demographic data at enrollment. Data regarding the history of hospitalization and
death were collected during the follow-up period.
SUBJECTS: We recruited 1,658 patients (1,255 maintenance hemodialysis and 403
chronic peritoneal dialysis) from multidialysis units (n = 27). We excluded
patients who had been hospitalized in the previous 3 months.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalization and survival rate during study period.
RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 55.2 ± 11.9 years old, and 55.2% were
male. Among the participants, 34.8% were rated as frail and 45.7% as prefrail.
Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant associations of frailty with age, 
comorbidity, disability, unemployment, higher body mass index, and a lower
educational level. During the follow-up period (median 17.1 months), 608 patients
(79 not frail, 250 prefrail, and 279 frail) were hospitalized, and 87 patients
(10 not frail, 24 prefrail, and 53 frail) died (P < .001). Frailty was associated
with hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80; 95% confidence interval:
1.38-2.36) and mortality (hazard ratio, 2.37, 95% confidence interval:
1.11-5.02).
CONCLUSION: The frailty phenotype was common even in, prevalent end-stage renal
disease patients on dialysis, and was significantly associated with higher rates 
of hospitalization and mortality.

The number of older end-stage renal disease patients being referred for kidney
transplantation continues to increase. This rise is occurring alongside the
continually increasing prevalence of older end-stage renal disease patients.
Although older kidney transplant recipients have decreased patient and graft
survival compared to younger patients, transplantation in this patient population
is pursued due to the survival advantage that it confers over remaining on the
deceased donor waiting list. The upper limit of age and the extent of comorbidity
and frailty at which transplantation ceases to be advantageous is not known.
Transplant physicians are therefore faced with the challenge of determining who
among older patients are appropriate candidates for kidney transplantation. This 
is usually achieved by means of an organ systems-based medical evaluation with
particular focus given to cardiovascular health. More recently, global measures
of health such as functional status and frailty are increasingly being recognized
as potential tools in risk stratifying kidney transplant candidates. For those
candidates who are deemed eligible, living donor transplantation should be
pursued. This may mean accepting a kidney from an older living donor. In the
absence of any living donor, the choice to accept lesser quality kidneys should
be made while taking into account the organ shortage and expected waiting times
on the deceased donor list. Appropriate counseling of patients should be a
cornerstone in the evaluation process and includes a discussion regarding
expected outcomes, expected waiting times in the setting of the new Kidney
Allocation System, benefits of living donor transplantation and the acceptance of
lesser quality kidneys.

It is known that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with increased
postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease 
who underwent lower extremity surgical revascularization; however, outcomes after
peripheral vascular intervention (PVI) are less well established. This study
sought to determine the impact of CKD on adverse outcomes in patients with
peripheral artery disease who underwent PVI. Using data from the Veteran Affairs 
Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System Program, we identified a
cohort of 755 patients who underwent lower extremity PVI from June 2005 to August
2010 at 33 sites. The outcomes of interest were mortality, progression to
dialysis, myocardial infarction, limb amputation, and stroke. Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard frailty models assessed the
association between CKD and adverse outcomes. Of the patients who underwent lower
extremity PVI, 201 patients (27%) had CKD. The presence of CKD was associated
with decreased survival (5-year survival probability of CKD compared with
non-CKD: 49.9% [41.6% to 59.9%] vs 80.1% [76.2% to 84.1]), which persisted after 
risk adjustment (HR 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.19). In addition,
there was a significant association between CKD and progression to dialysis (HR
6.62; 95% confidence interval 2.25 to 19.43). In contrast, there was no
association between CKD and re-hospitalization for myocardial infarction, limb
amputation, or stroke. In conclusion, CKD is present in 1 of 4 patients who
underwent PVI and is associated with increased risk of mortality and progression 
to dialysis.

Hypoalbuminemia, a frailty criterion, belongs to a group of co-morbidities not
captured as a traditional risk factor. We assessed its prognostic value in
patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The study 
included 1,215 consecutive patients from the Optimized Catheter Valvular
Intervention -TAVI Japanese multicenter registry. Hypoalbuminemia was defined as 
serum albumin level <3.5 g/dl. Baseline characteristics, procedural outcomes, and
all-cause, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality rates after TAVI were
compared between patients with albumin level <3.5 g/dl (hypo[h]-ALB group, n =
284) and those with albumin level >3.5 g/dl (nonhypo[nh]-ALB group, n = 931).
Several baseline characteristics differed significantly between both groups,
including age (85.1 ± 5.1 vs 84.2 ± 4.9 years, p = 0.012), ejection fraction
(58.5 ± 14.3% vs 62.9 ± 12.4%, p <0.001), baseline kidney function, or liver
disease. The 30-day mortality rate in all patients showed significant differences
between the 2 groups (3.9% vs 1.3%, p = 0.005). During a mean follow-up of
330 days, cumulative all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality
rates were significantly higher in the hALB group than in the nhALB group
(log-rank test, p <0.001, p = 0.0021, and p <0.001, respectively). The groups
were also analyzed using a propensity matching model for adjusting the baseline
differences. The analysis revealed that the poorer prognosis of the hALB group in
terms of cumulative all-cause and noncardiovascular mortality was retained (p =
0.038, and p = 0.0068, respectively); however, differences in cardiovascular
mortality rates in the 2 groups were attenuated (p = 0.93). In conclusion,
hypoalbuminemia was associated with poor prognosis, highlighted by the increase
in noncardiovascular mortality. Baseline albumin level could be a useful marker
for risk stratification before TAVI.

PURPOSE: Frailty and functional status have emerged as significant predictors of 
morbidity and mortality for patients undergoing cancer surgery. To articulate the
impact on value (ie quality per cost), we compared perioperative outcomes and
expenditures according to patient function for older adults undergoing kidney
cancer surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using linked SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
Results)-Medicare data, we identified 19,129 elderly patients with kidney cancer 
treated with nonablative surgery from 2000 to 2009. We quantified patient
function using function related indicators (claims indicative of dysfunction and 
disability) and measured 30-day morbidity, mortality, resource use and cost.
Using multivariable, mixed effects models to adjust for patient and hospital
characteristics, we estimated the relationship of patient functionality with both
treatment outcomes and expenditures.
RESULTS: Of 19,129 patients we identified 5,509 (28.8%) and 3,127 (16.4%) with a 
function related indicator count of 1 and 2 or greater, respectively. While
surgical complications did not vary (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86-1.05), patients with 2 
or more indicators more often experienced a medical event (OR 1.22, 95% CI
1.10-1.36) or a geriatric event (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.33-1.81), or died within 30
days of surgery (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.10-1.86) compared with patients with no
baseline dysfunction. These patients utilized significantly more medical
resources and amassed higher acute care expenditures (p <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: During kidney cancer surgery, patients in poor functional health can
face a more eventful medical recovery at elevated cost, indicating lower value
care. Greater consideration of frailty and functional status during treatment
planning and transitions may represent areas for value enhancement in kidney
cancer and urology care.

BACKGROUND: Frail individuals are at increased risk for poor outcomes, including 
adverse drug events. Kidney function is often compromised in frailty and is a key
consideration in medication choice and dosing; however, creatinine-based measures
of kidney function may be biased in frail individuals.
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,987 community-dwelling older men and women with
complete data who participated in visit 5 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Study (2011-2013).
PREDICTORS: Kidney measures included glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated
using serum creatinine (eGFRcr) and serum cystatin C level (eGFRcys) and urine
albumin-creatinine ratio.
OUTCOME: Frailty, defined using established criteria of 3 or more frailty
characteristics (weight loss, slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and low physical
activity).
RESULTS: 341 (7%) participants were classified as frail, 1,475 (30%) had
eGFRcr<60mL/min/1.73m2, 2,480 (50%) had eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2, and 1,006 (20%) 
had albuminuria with albumin excretion ≥ 30mg/g. Among frail participants,
prevalences of eGFRcr and eGFRcys<60mL/min/1.73m2 were 45% and 77%, respectively.
Adjusted for covariates, frailty showed a moderate association with eGFRcr and a 
strong association with eGFRcys and albumin-creatinine ratio. Frail individuals
with eGFRcr of 60 to <75mL/min/1.73m2 were frequently reclassified to lower eGFR 
categories using eGFRcys (49% to 45-<60, 32% to 30-<45, and 3%
to <30mL/min/1.73m2). Hyperpolypharmacy (taking ≥10 classes of medications) was
more common in frail individuals (54% vs 38% of nonfrail), including classes
requiring kidney clearance (eg, digoxin) and associated with falls and subsequent
complications (eg, hypnotic/sedatives and anticoagulants).
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail individuals had a high prevalence of reduced kidney function, 
with large discrepancies when reduced kidney function was classified by eGFRcys
versus eGFRcr. Given the substantial medication burden and uncertainty in chronic
kidney disease classification, confirmation of kidney function with alternative
biomarkers may be warranted to ensure careful prescribing practices in this
vulnerable population.

SIGNIFICANCE: Cachexia is defined as a complex metabolic syndrome that is
associated with underlying illness and a loss of muscle with or without loss of
fat mass. This disease is associated with a high incidence with chronic diseases 
such as heart failure, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), among others. Since there is currently
no effective treatment available, cachectic patients have a poor prognosis.
Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms is, therefore, an important medical
task. Recent Advances: There is accumulating evidence that the diseased organs
such as heart, lung, kidney, or cancer tissue secrete soluble factors, including 
Angiotensin II, myostatin (growth differentiation factor 8 [GDF8]), GDF11, tumor 
growth factor beta (TGFβ), which act on skeletal muscle. There, they induce a set
of genes called atrogenes, which, among others, induce the ubiquitin-proteasome
system, leading to protein degradation. Moreover, elevated reactive oxygen
species (ROS) levels due to modulation of NADPH oxidases (Nox) and mitochondrial 
function contribute to disease progression, which is characterized by loss of
muscle mass, exercise resistance, and frailty.
CRITICAL ISSUES: Although substantial progress was achieved to elucidate the
pathophysiology of cachexia, effectice therapeutic strategies are urgently
needed.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: With the identification of key components of the aberrant
inter-organ communication leading to cachexia, studies in mice and men to inhibit
ROS formation, induction of anti-oxidative superoxide dismutases, and
upregulation of muscular nitric oxide (NO) formation either by pharmacological
tools or by exercise are promising approaches to reduce the extent of skeletal
muscle wasting. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 26, 700-717.

Joint Model for Mortality and Hospitalization.

Chen Y, Guo W, Kotanko P, Usvyat L, Wang Y.

Modeling hospitalization is complicated because the follow-up time can be
censored due to death. In this paper, we propose a shared frailty joint model for
survival time and hospitalization. A random effect semi-parametric proportional
hazard model is assumed for the survival time and conditional on the follow-up
time, hospital admissions or total length of stay is modeled by a generalized
linear model with a nonparametric offset function of the follow-up time. We
assume that the hospitalization and the survival time are correlated through a
latent subject-specific random frailty. The proposed model can be implemented
using existing software such as SAS Proc NLMIXED. We demonstrate the feasibility 
through simulations. We apply our methods to study hospital admissions and total 
length of stay in a cohort of patients on hemodialysis. We identify age, albumin,
neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and vintage as significant risk factors for 
mortality, and age, gender, race, albumin, NLR, pre-dialysis systolic blood
pressure (preSBP), interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) and equilibrated Kt/V (eKt/V)
as significant risk factors for both hospital admissions and total length of
stay. In addition, hospitalization admissions is positively associated with
vintage.

The scope of this article is to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors
associated with the frailty of elderly people with chronic kidney disease on
hemodialysis. This involved a correlational, cross-sectional study conducted in a
dialysis center in the state of São Paulo. The sample consisted of 60
participants. The Participant Characterization Instrument was used for extracting
sociodemographic and clinical data and the Edmonton Frail Scale was used to
evaluate the level of frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
identify the factors associated with frailty. The mean age of the 60 patients
included was 71.1 (± 6.9) years, predominantly male (70%), of which 36.7% were
classified as frail. With respect to the factors associated with frailty among
the variables of gender, age, self-reported skin color, schooling, monthly per
capita income, hemodialysis time, number of associated diseases, falls in the
year, hematocrit level, parathyroid hormone and use of calcitriol, it was found
that only the monthly per capita income was significantly associated with frailty
(OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.1-0.9; p = 0.04). There was an association between frailty
and income, showing that the elderly most at risk of frailty were those with
lower income.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is associated with increased vulnerability to poor health.
There is growing interest in understanding the association between frailty and
chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review explored how frailty is
measured in patients with CKD and the association between frailty and adverse
outcomes across different stages of renal impairment.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic analysis of peer reviewed articles.
DATA SOURCES: Pubmed, Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane were used to identify 
the articles.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Articles published before the 17th of September 2016, that
measured frailty in patients with CKD was eligible for the systematic review. Two
independent researchers assessed the eligibility of the articles. Quality of the 
articles was assessed using the Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 540 articles, of which 32 met the study
criteria and were included in the review (n=36,076, age range: 50-83 years).
Twenty-three (72%) studies used or adapted the Fried phenotype to measure
frailty. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 7% in community-dwellers (CKD
Stages 1-4) to 73% in a cohort of patients on haemodialysis. The incidence of
frailty increased with reduced glomerular filtration rate. Frailty was associated
with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is prevalent in patients with CKD and it is associated with
an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. There are differences in the
methods used to assess frailty and this hinders comparisons between studies.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than one third of older
adults, and is a strong risk factor for vascular disease and cognitive
impairment. Cognitive impairment can have detrimental effects on the quality of
life through decreased treatment adherence and poor nutrition and results in
increased costs of care and early mortality. Though widely studied in
hemodialysis populations, little is known about cognitive impairment in patients 
with pre-dialysis CKD.
METHODS: Multicenter, cross-sectional, prospective cohort study including 385
patients with CKD stages G4-G5. Cognitive function was measured with a validated 
tool called the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as part of a comprehensive
frailty assessment in the Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial.
Cognitive impairment was defined as a MoCA score of ≤24. We determined the
prevalence and risk factors for cognitive impairment in patients with CKD stages 
G4-G5, not on dialysis.
RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty seven participants (61%) with CKD stages G4-G5
had cognitive impairment at baseline assessment. When compared to a control
group, this population scored lower in all domains of cognition, with the most
pronounced deficits observed in recall, attention, and visual/executive function 
(p < 0.01 for all comparisons). Older age, recent history of falls and history of
stroke were independently associated with cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovered a high rate of unrecognized cognitive impairment
in an advanced CKD population. This impairment is global, affecting all aspects
of cognition and is likely vascular in nature. The longitudinal trajectory of
cognitive function and its effect on dialysis decision-making and outcomes
deserves further study.

AIM: To investigate associations between clinical parameters - beyond the evident
physiological deterioration and limitations of medical treatment - with
in-hospital death for patients receiving Rapid Response System (RRS) attendances.
METHODS: Retrospective case-control analysis of clinical parameters for 328
patients aged 60 years and above at their last RRS call during admission to a
single teaching hospital in the 2012-2013 calendar years. Generalised estimating 
equation modelling was used to compare the deceased with a randomly selected
sample of those who had RRS calls and survived admission (controls), matched by
age group, sex, and hospital ward.
RESULTS: In addition to a pre-existing order for limitation of treatment or
cardiac arrest (OR 6.92; 95%CI 4.61-10.27), nursing home residence, proteinuria, 
advanced malignancy, acute myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease,
cognitive impairment and frailty were associated with high risk of death. After
adjusting for all the clinical indicators investigated, the strongest risk
factors for in-hospital death for patients with a RRS call were advanced
malignancy (OR 3.95; 95%CI 2.16-7.21) and new myocardial infarction (OR 2.79;
95%CI 1.86-4.20). Patients with cognitive impairment, frailty indicator or
chronic kidney disease were twice as likely to die as patients without those risk
factors.
CONCLUSION: In a sample of older deteriorated patients requiring a RRS
attendance, multiple indicators of chronic illness, cognitive impairment and
frailty were significantly associated with high risk of death. These clinical
features beyond the evident orders for limitation of medical treatment should
signal the need for clinicians to initiate end-of-life discussions that may
prevent futile interventions.

BACKGROUND: Frailty increases early hospital readmission and mortality risk among
kidney transplantation (KT) recipients. Although frailty represents a high-risk
state for this population, the correlates of frailty, the patterns of the 5
frailty components, and the risk associated with these patterns are unclear.
METHODS: Six hundred sixty-three KT recipients were enrolled in a cohort study of
frailty in transplantation (12/2008-8/2015). Frailty, activities of daily living 
(ADL)/instrumental ADL (IADL) disability, Centers for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale depression, education, and health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) were measured. We used multinomial regression to identify frailty
correlates. We identified which patterns of the 5 components were associated with
mortality using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Frailty prevalence was 19.5%. Older recipients (adjusted prevalence
ratio [PR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.07) were more likely to be
frail. The only other factors that were independently associated with frailty
were IADL disability (PR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.72-6.06), depressive symptoms (PR,
11.31; 95% CI, 4.02-31.82), less than a high school education (PR, 3.10; 95% CI, 
1.30-7.36), and low HRQOL (fair/poor: PR, 3.71; 95% CI, 1.48-9.31). The most
common pattern was poor grip strength, low physical activity, and slowed walk
speed (19.4%). Only 2 patterns of the 5 components emerged as having an
association with post-KT mortality. KT recipients with exhaustion and slowed
walking speed (hazards ratio = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.17-5.03) and poor grip strength,
exhaustion, and slowed walking speed (hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.14-5.97) were
at increased mortality risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Age was the only conventional factor associated with frailty among
KT recipients; however, factors rarely measured as part of clinical practice,
namely, HRQOL, IADL disability, and depressive symptoms, were significant
correlates of frailty. Redefining the frailty phenotype may be needed to improve 
risk stratification for KT recipients.

Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies showed that frailty is prevalent in both
pre-dialysis and dialysis patients. However, the prevalence and prognostic
implication of frailty in Chinese peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients remain
unknown.
METHODS: We used a validated questionnaire to determine the Frailty Score of 193 
unselected prevalent PD patients. All patients were then followed for 2 years for
their need of hospitalization and mortality.
RESULTS: Amongst the 193 patients, 134 (69.4%) met the criteria of being frail.
Frailty Score significantly correlated with Charlson's comorbidity score (r =
0.40, p < 0.0001), Malnutrition Inflammation Score (r = 0.59, p < 0.0001), and
inversely with Subjective Global Assessment score (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001).
Frailty was closely associated with the need of hospitalization. Patients with
nil, mild, moderate, and severe frailty required 2.4 ± 6.0, 1.6 ± 1.6, 2.7 ± 2.5,
5.2 ± 4.8 hospital admissions per year, respectively (p < 0.0001), and they
stayed in hospital for 6.4 ± 9.2, 5.3 ± 6.2, 10.0 ± 10.4, 12.9 ± 20.1 days per
hospital admission, respectively (p < 0.0001). However, Frailty Score was not an 
independent predictor of patient or technique survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is prevalent among Chinese PD patients. Frail PD patients
have a high risk of requiring hospitalization and their hospital stay tends to be
prolonged. Early identification may allow timely intervention to prevent adverse 
health outcomes in this group of patients.

Frailty is associated with inferior survival and increased resource requirements 
among kidney transplant candidates, but assessments are time-intensive and costly
and require direct patient interaction. Waitlist hospitalization may be a proxy
for patient fitness and could help those at risk of poor outcomes. We examined
United States Renal Data System data from 51 111 adult end-stage renal disease
patients with continuous Medicare coverage who were waitlisted for transplant
from January 2000 to December 2011. Heavily admitted patients had higher
subsequent resource requirements, increased waitlist mortality and decreased
likelihood of transplant (death after listing: 1-7 days: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.28; 8-14 days: HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.42-1.56; ≥15
days: HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.99-2.15; vs. 0 days). Graft and recipient survival was
inferior, with higher admissions, although survival benefit was preserved. A
model including waitlist admissions alone performed better (C statistic 0.76, 95%
CI 0.74-0.80) in predicting postlisting mortality than estimated posttransplant
survival (C statistic 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.73). Although those with a heavy burden
of admissions may still benefit from kidney transplant, less utility is derived
from allografts placed in this population. Current kidney allocation policy,
which is based in part on longevity matching, could be significantly improved by 
consideration of hospitalization records of transplant candidates.

AIM: To present the rationale, design and methodology of the GERAS project, which
examines whether assessment of frailty and mild cognitive impairment could
enhance risk prediction for biomedical, psychosocial outcomes and foster
efficient resource allocation in kidney transplantation.
BACKGROUND: For the burgeoning cohort of older patients considered for kidney
transplantation, evidence gaps regarding frailty and mild cognitive impairment
limit clinical decision-making and medical management. As known risk factors for 
'hard' clinical outcomes in chronic illness, both require further study in
transplantation. Integrating these and other bio-psychosocial factors into a
comprehensive pre-transplant patient assessment will provide insights regarding
economic implications and may improve risk prediction.
DESIGN: A nation-wide multi-centre prospective cohort study nested in the Swiss
Transplant Cohort Study.
METHODS: Our nationally representative convenience sample includes 250 adult
kidney transplant recipients. Data sources include the Swiss Transplant Cohort
Study and primary data collected at time of transplantation, 6 months, 1 and
2 years post-transplant via established measures (the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment, Psychosocial Questionnaire, Fried Frailty Instrument and a blood
analysis), investigator-developed instruments and datasets compiled by hospitals'
management control units, sickness funds, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office
and the European Renal Association. Descriptive, competing risk survival and
mixed effects analyses will be performed. Research Ethics Committee approval was 
obtained in January 2016.
DISCUSSION: This pioneering project jointly examines frailty and mild cognitive
impairment from bio-psychosocial and health economic perspectives. Results may
significantly inform risk prediction, care tailoring and resource optimization to
improve health outcomes in the ageing kidney transplant cohort.

AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between kidney
function with concomitant diabetes or hypertension and frailty in
community-dwelling Japanese older adults.
METHODS: The participants were 9606 residents (community-dwelling Japanese older 
adults) who completed baseline assessments. The estimated glomerular filtration
rate (mL/min/1.73 m2 ) was determined according to the serum creatinine level,
and participants were classified into four mutually exclusive categories: ≥60.0
(normal range), 45.0-59.9, 30.0-44.9 and <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Frailty status
was defined using five criteria as described by Fried: slow gait speed, muscle
weakness, low physical activity, exhaustion and unintentional weight loss.
Participants who met three, four or five criteria satisfied the definition of
having frailty. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
relationships between estimated glomerular filtration rate and frailty.
RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, participants with lower kidney function
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <30.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) were more frail
(odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-3.59). In addition,
individuals with a history of diabetes (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.21-8.24) or
hypertension (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.45-5.12) showed a significantly increased risk of
frailty in the lower kidney function group, regardless of multivariate controls. 
Furthermore, the analyses showed an even greater increase in the risk of frailty 
in patients with a history of both diabetes and hypertension (OR 3.67, 95% CI
1.13-14.1) CONCLUSIONS: A lower level of kidney function was associated with a
higher risk of frailty in community-dwelling Japanese older adults. Geriatr

Dysregulation of skeletal remodeling is a component of renal osteodystrophy.
Previously, we showed that activin receptor signaling is differentially affected 
in various tissues in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We tested whether a ligand
trap for the activin receptor type 2A (RAP-011) is an effective treatment of the 
osteodystrophy of the CKD-mineral bone disorder. With a 70% reduction in the
glomerular filtration rate, CKD was induced at 14 weeks of age in the ldlr-/-
high fat-fed mouse model of atherosclerotic vascular calcification and diabetes. 
Twenty mice with CKD, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated
activin A were treated with RAP-011, wherease 19 mice were given vehicle twice
weekly from week 22 until the mice were killed at 28 weeks of age. The animals
were then evaluated by skeletal histomorphometry, micro-computed tomography,
mechanical strength testing, and ex vivo bone cell culture. Results in the CKD
groups were compared with those of the 16 sham-operated ldlr-/- high fat-fed
mice. Sham-operated mice had low-turnover osteodystrophy and skeletal frailty.
CKD stimulated bone remodeling with significant increases in osteoclast and
osteoblast numbers and bone resorption. Compared with mice with CKD
and sham-operated mice, RAP-011 treatment eliminated the CKD-induced increase in 
these histomorphometric parameters and increased trabecular bone fraction.
RAP-011 significantly increased cortical bone area and thickness. Activin
A-enhanced osteoclastogenesis was mediated through p-Smad2 association with c-fos
and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1). Thus, an
ActRIIA ligand trap reversed CKD-stimulated bone remodeling, likely through
inhibition of activin-A induced osteoclastogenesis.

PURPOSE: Although a population's senescence rate is classically measured as the
increase in mortality rate with age on a logarithmic scale, it may be more
accurately measured as the increase on a linear scale. Patients on dialysis, who 
suffer from accelerated senescence, exhibit a smaller increase in their mortality
rate on a logarithmic scale, but a larger increase on a linear scale than
patients with a functioning kidney transplant. However, this comparison may be
biased by population heterogeneity.
METHODS: Follow-up data on 323,308 patients on dialysis and 91,679 patients with 
a functioning kidney transplant were derived from the ERA-EDTA Registry. We
measured the increases in their mortality rates using Gompertz frailty models
that allow individual variation in this increase.
RESULTS: According to these models, the senescence rate measured as the increase 
in mortality rate on a logarithmic scale was smaller in patients on dialysis,
while the senescence rate measured as the increase on a linear scale was larger
in patients on dialysis than patients with a functioning kidney transplant.
CONCLUSIONS: Also when accounting for population heterogeneity, a population's
senescence rate is more accurately measured as the increase in mortality rate on 
a linear scale than a logarithmic scale.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether frailty, a novel measure of physiologic reserve, is
associated with longer kidney transplant (KT) length of stay (LOS), and modifies 
the association between LOS and mortality.
BACKGROUND: Better understanding of LOS is necessary for informed consent and
discharge planning. Mortality resulting from longer LOS has important regulatory 
implications for hospital and transplant programs. Which recipients are at risk
of prolonged LOS and its effect on mortality are unclear. Frailty is a novel
preoperative predictor of poor KT outcomes including delayed graft function,
early hospital readmission, immunosuppression intolerance, and mortality.
METHODS: We used registry-augmented hybrid methods, a novel approach to risk
adjustment, to adjust for LOS risk factors from the Scientific Registry of
Transplant Recipients (n = 74,859) and tested whether (1) frailty, measured
immediately before KT in a novel cohort (n = 589), was associated with LOS (LOS: 
negative binomial regression; LOS ≥2 weeks: logistic regression) and (2) whether 
frailty modified the association between LOS and mortality (interaction term
analysis).
RESULTS: Frailty was independently associated with longer LOS [relative risk =
1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.29; P = 0.01] and LOS ≥2 weeks (odds
ratio = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.06-2.33; P = 0.03) after accounting for registry-based
risk factors, including delayed graft function. Frailty also attenuated the
association between LOS and mortality (nonfrail hazard rate = 1.55 95% CI:
1.30-1.86; P < 0.001; frail hazard rate = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79-1.19, P = 0.80; P
for interaction = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail KT recipients are more likely to experience a longer LOS.
Longer LOS among nonfrail recipients may be a marker of increased mortality risk.
Frailty is a measure of physiologic reserve that may be an important clinical
marker of longer surgical LOS.

Dialysis adequacy is traditionally based on urea clearance, adjusted for total
body volume (Kt/Vurea), and clinical guidelines recommend a Kt/Vurea target for
peritoneal dialysis. We wished to determine whether adjusting dialysis dose by
resting and total energy expenditure would alter the delivered dialysis dose. The
resting and total energy expenditures were determined by equations based on
doubly labeled isotopic water studies and adjusted Kturea for resting energy
expenditure and total energy expenditure in 148 peritoneal dialysis patients
(mean age, 60.6 years; 97 male [65.5%]; 54 diabetic [36.5%]). The mean resting
energy expenditure was 1534 kcal/d, and the total energy expenditure was 1974
kcal/day. Using a weekly target Kt/V of 1.7, Kt was calculated using V measured
by bioimpedance and the significantly associated (r = 0.67) Watson equation for
total body water. Adjusting Kt for resting energy expenditure showed a reduced
delivered dialysis dose (ml/kcal per day) for women versus men (5.5 vs. 6.2), age
under versus over 65 years (5.6 vs. 6.4), weight <65 versus >80 kg (5.8 vs. 6.1),
low versus high comorbidity (5.9 vs. 6.2), all of which were significant.
Adjusting for the total energy expenditure showed significantly reduced dosing
for those employed versus not employed (4.3 vs. 4.8), a low versus high frailty
score (4.5 vs. 5.0) and nondiabetic versus diabetic (4.6 vs. 4.9). Thus, the
current paradigm for a single target Kt/Vurea for all peritoneal dialysis
patients does not take into account energy expenditure and metabolic rate and may
lead to lowered dialysis delivery for the younger, more active female patient.

Frailty is a major health burden in an aging society. It constitutes a clinical
state of reduced physiological reserves that is associated with a diminished
ability to withstand internal and external stressors. Frail patients have an
increased risk for adverse clinical outcomes, such as mortality, readmission to
hospital, institutionalization and falls. Of further clinical interest, frailty
might be at least in part reversible in some patients and subject to preventive
strategies. In daily clinical practice older patients with a complex health
status, who are mostly frail or at least at risk of developing frailty, are
frequently cared for by geriatricians. Recently, clinicians and scientists from
other medical disciplines, such as cardiology, pulmonology, gastroenterology,
nephrology, endocrinology, rheumatology, surgery and critical care medicine also 
discovered frailty to be an interesting instrument for risk stratification of
patients, including younger patients. In this review we highlight the results of 
recent studies that demonstrated the significance of frailty to predict adverse
clinical outcomes in patients with specific medical conditions, such as cardiac, 
lung, liver and kidney diseases as well as diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis,
trauma patients, patients undergoing surgery and critically ill patients.
Multiple studies in patients with the aforementioned specific medical conditions 
could be identified demonstrating a predictive role of frailty for several
adverse clinical outcomes. The association between frailty and adverse clinical
outcomes reported in these studies was in part independent of several major
potential confounder factors, such as age, sex, race, comorbidities and
disabilities and were also detected in younger patients.

BACKGROUND: Older adults hospitalized with fragility fractures are at high risk
of negative events that can culminate in re-presentations to hospital emergency
departments or readmissions to hospital. This systematic review aimed to identify
patient, clinical, or hospital-related factors that are identifiable at the index
admission and that may be associated with re-presentations to hospital emergency 
departments or hospital readmissions in older adults following fragility
fractures.
METHODS: Four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Scopus) were
searched. A suite of search terms identified peer-reviewed English-language
articles that examined potential correlates of hospital re-presentation in older 
adults (mean age ≥ 65 years) who were discharged from hospital following
treatment for fragility fractures. A three-stage screening process (titles,
abstracts, full text) was conducted by two researchers independently. Participant
characteristics, study design, potential correlates examined, analyses, and
findings were extracted for studies included in the review. Quality and risk of
bias were assessed with the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality
Assessment Tool. The strength of evidence was incorporated into a best evidence
synthesis, and meta-analysis was conducted where effect pooling was possible.
RESULTS: Eleven of 35 eligible studies were categorized as high quality studies. 
These studies reported that age, higher Cumulative Illness Rating scores,
American Society of Anesthesiologists scores > 3, longer length of stay, male
sex, cardiovascular disease, low post-operative hemoglobin, kidney disease,
dementia and cancer were factors identified at the index admission that were
predictive of subsequent re-presentation to hospital. Age was the only predictor 
for which pooling of effects across studies was possible: pooling was conducted
for re-presentation ≤ 30 days (pooled OR, 1.27; 95 % CI, 1.14-1.43) and > 30 days
(pooled OR, 1.23; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.50).
CONCLUSIONS: The best-evidence synthesis, in addition to the meta-analysis,
identified a range of factors that may have utility in guiding clinical practice 
and policy guidelines for targeted interventions to reduce the need for
re-presentation to hospital among this frail clinical population. The paucity of 
studies investigating re-presentations to hospital emergency departments without 
admission was an important gap in the literature identified in this review. Key
limitations were exclusion of non-English language studies and grey literature.

BACKGROUND: Although preoperative renal dysfunction (RD) is associated with
increased mortality and morbidity after surgical aortic valve replacement, its
impact on clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)
is less defined.
METHODS: TAVR patients in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) 
trial with a calculable glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease equation were included. Patients were divided into three
groups: GFR >60 mL/min (none/mild RD), GFR 31 to 60 mL/min (moderate RD), and GFR
≤30 mL/min (severe RD). Operative characteristics and clinical outcomes were
analyzed. Cox regression models were used to determine multivariable predictors
of 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2,531 inoperable or high surgical risk patients from the
PARTNER trial and continued access registries had a calculable GFR level: 767
(30%) had normal renal function or mild RD, 1,473 (58%) had moderate RD, and 291 
(12%) presented with severe RD. The mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted
Risk of Mortality for the cohort was 11.5%, and it was highest in those with
severe RD (13.8%). Patients with severe RD were more often women with a higher
prevalence of diabetes. Patients with severe RD had the highest incidence of
30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality and rehospitalization. The 30-day rate of
death from any cause was 10.7% in the severe RD group versus 6.0% in the moderate
and mild RD groups (p = 0.01). The 1-year rate of death from any cause was 34.4% 
in the severe RD group versus 21.5% in the moderate RD and 20.8% in the none/mild
RD groups (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.24, p < 0.0001 for severe versus
none/mild; adjusted HR 1.14, p = 0.24 for severe versus moderate). Other
significant predictors of 1-year all-cause mortality included lower body mass
index, frailty, the transapical approach, a lower ejection fraction,
oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and male
sex.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative severe RD is a significant predictor for 1-year
mortality in TAVR patients. Careful risk stratification by the heart team is
required in patients with severe preprocedural RD.

Aging and kidney disease.

[Article in Japanese]

Wakino S, Itoh H.

Kidney is an energy-consuming organ and its function deteriorates according as
aging. Various mechanisms for cellular senescence and organ aging have an impact 
on the initiation and progression of CKD, which includes telomere attrition,
genomic instability, stem cell exhaustion, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired
nutrient signaling, inactivation of Sirtuin or Klotho-mediated pathway and
renin-angiotensin system activation. Interventions in these pathways have
provided therapeutic strategy against CKD. On the other hand, renal dys-
function, in turn, affects human aging process. Because of this close
relationship between human aging process and CKD, aging phenotype, such as
frailty can be used as a clinical marker of the prognosis of CKD as well as of
other age-related diseases including cardio- vascular disease and type II
diabetes. Amelioration of this aging phenotype can provide a novel therapeutic
strategy against CKD for the purpose of providing CKD patients with suc- cessful 
aging.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a perioperative metastatic spinal
tumor frailty index (MSTFI) that could predict morbidity, mortality, and length
of stay.
METHODS: A large inpatient hospitalization database was searched from 2002 to
2011 to identify 4583 patients with spinal metastasis from breast (21.1%), lung
(34.1%), thyroid (3.8%), renal (19.9%), and prostate (21.1%) cancer who underwent
surgery. A multiple logistic regression model identified 9 independent parameters
that were used to construct the MSTFI: anemia, chronic lung disease,
coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, pulmonary circulation disorders, renal
failure, malnutrition, emergent/urgent admission, and anterior/combined surgical 
approach. Patients with 0 points were categorized as "not frail," 1 as "mildly
frail," 2 as "moderately frail," and ≥3 as "severely frail."
RESULTS: The overall perioperative complication rate was 19.3% and in-patient
mortality was 3.0%. Compared with patients with no frailty, patients with
moderate frailty (odds ratio [OR] 5.15; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]
2.44-10.86), and severe frailty (OR 5.74; 95% CI 2.69-12.24) had significantly
increased odds of inpatient mortality (all P < 0.001). Similarly, patients with
mild frailty (OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.33-2.66), moderate frailty (OR 3.83; 95% CI
2.71-5.41), and severe frailty (OR 6.97; 95% CI 4.98-9.74) had significantly
increased odds of developing a major in-hospital complication (all P < 0.001).
Length of stay also increased significantly by MSTFI (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In surgically treated patients with spinal metastasis, certain
perioperative parameters may significantly predict the risk of major in-hospital 
complications and mortality.

Dialysis care is often associated with poor outcomes including low quality of
life (QOL). To improve patient-reported outcomes, incorporation of the patient's 
needs and perspective into the medical care they receive is essential. This
article provides a framework to help clinicians integrate symptom assessment and 
other measures such as QOL and frailty scores into a clinical approach to the
contemporary supportive care of patients with advanced CKD. This approach
involves (1) defining our understanding of kidney supportive care,
patient-centered dialysis, and palliative dialysis; (2) understanding and
recognizing common symptoms associated with advanced CKD; (3) discussing the
concepts of physical function, frailty, and QOL and their role in CKD; and (4)
identifying the structural and process barriers that may arise when
patient-centered dialysis is being introduced into clinical practice.

Patients aged 80 or over with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) often have
comorbidities that increase drug toxicity and prevent the use of otherwise
optimal treatment. We performed a retrospective analysis of 43 patients aged 80
or over (median age: 83; range: 80-93) unable to receive treatment with
anthracyclines, at diagnosis of DLBCL, treated with an R-CVP treatment (standard 
R-CHOP without doxorubicin). The patients had one or more comorbidities: 18
patients (41.9 %) had a performance status (PS) of 3; 23 patients (53.5 %) had
low creatinine clearance; 12 patients (27.9 %) had low left ventricular ejection 
fraction; seven patients (16.3 %) had poor hepatic function; and 26 patients
(60.5 %) had a Charlson index score ≥4. Thirty patients (70 %) had two or three
adverse factors according to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index.
Twenty-five patients (58.1 %) received eight cycles of R-CVP, but the full eight 
cycles could not be given to 18 patients (41.9 %). The OR rate was 58.1 % (CR
37.2 %). There were 34 deaths (79 %) during treatment and follow-up. Ten patients
(23.3 %) died early from toxicity before interim evaluation; all had PS 3. The
median follow-up of surviving patients was 52.6 months. The overall 2-year
survival rate was 31.9 % and the median OS was 12.6 months. The median OS for
patients who completed the entire treatment was 26.4 months. The median PFS was
11.2 months. In multivariate analyses, OS was only affected by performance status
≥2 and Charlson index score ≥4. The R-CVP regimen can be active in elderly frail 
patients aged 80 or more with DLBCL, but systematic geriatric assessment is
required so that those unsuitable for chemotherapy are excluded.

OBJECTIVES: Screening tools to determine which outpatients with cirrhosis are at 
highest risk for unplanned hospitalization are lacking. Frailty is a novel
prognostic factor but conventional screening for frailty is time consuming. We
evaluated the ability of a 1 min bedside screen (Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS)) to
predict unplanned hospitalization or death in outpatients with cirrhosis and
compared the CFS with two conventional frailty measures (Fried Frailty Criteria
(FFC) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)).
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled consecutive outpatients from three tertiary
care liver clinics. Frailty was defined by CFS >4. The primary outcome was the
composite of unplanned hospitalization or death within 6 months of study entry.
RESULTS: A total of 300 outpatients were enrolled (mean age 57 years, 35% female,
81% white, 66% hepatitis C or alcohol-related liver disease, mean Model for
End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score 12, 28% with ascites). Overall, 54 (18%)
outpatients were frail and 91 (30%) patients had an unplanned hospitalization or 
death within 6 months. CFS >4 was independently associated with increased rates
of unplanned hospitalization or death (57% frail vs. 24% not frail, adjusted odds
ratio 3.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-7.5; P=0.0008) and there was a dose 
response (adjusted odds ratio 1.9 per 1-unit increase in CFS, 95% CI: 1.4-2.6;
P<0.0001). Models including MELD, ascites, and CFS >4 had a greater
discrimination (c-statistic=0.84) than models using FFC or SPPB.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is strongly and independently associated with an increased
risk of unplanned hospitalization or death in outpatients with cirrhosis. The CFS
is a rapid screen that could be easily adopted in liver clinics to identify those
at highest risk of adverse events.

BACKGROUND: Numerous frailty screening instruments are available, but their
applicability for identifying frailty in patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) is unknown. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of three
instruments used for frailty screening in an ESRD population.
METHODS: The study was conducted in 2013 in a teaching hospital in The
Netherlands and included patients receiving haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis
and pre-dialysis care. We determined the sensitivity and specificity of three
screening instruments: the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), the Identification 
of Seniors at Risk-Hospitalized Patients (ISAR-HP) and the
Veiligheidsmanagementsysteem (VMS), which is a safety management system for
vulnerable elderly patients. The Frailty Index was the gold standard used.
RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty was 37% in a total of 95 participants with
ESRD [mean age 65.2 years (SD 12.0), 57% male]. Frailty prevalence in
participants ≥65 years of age and <65 years of age was 44% and 28%, respectively 
(P = 0.11). Sensitivity and specificity for frailty of the GFI were 89% and 57%, 
respectively; ISAR-HP 83% and 77%, respectively; and VMS 77% and 67%,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the GFI showed the highest sensitivity, it is not yet
possible to propose a firm choice for one of these screening instruments or
specific items due to the small scale of the study. Since there is a high
prevalence of frailty in ESRD patients, translation and testing of the
effectiveness of screening using the GFI in the prognostication and prevention of
development or deterioration of frailty in this population should be the next
step.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent in the United States and
throughout the world,(1) with approximately 13% of adults affected.(2) In
addition, according to recent estimates, almost half of patients with CKD stages 
3 to 5 are 70 years of age and older.(2) In the United States, the number of
prevalent end-stage renal disease cases continues to increase in patients older
than age 65. In light of the demographic characteristics of patients with CKD and
ESRD, there has been considerable focus on associations between CKD and
cardiovascular outcomes.(3) Until recently, less attention had been paid to other
consequences of CKD in general and among older individuals with CKD in
particular, but there is now solid evidence linking CKD with impairments of
physical function, cognitive function, and emotional function and quality of
life. This review summarizes available literature on these topics, focusing
specifically on physical functioning and frailty, cognitive function, emotional
health, including depression and anxiety, and health-related quality of life.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem that is associated
with excess morbidity, mortality, and health resource utilization. The
progression of CKD is defined by a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and
leads to a variety of metabolic abnormalities including acidosis, hypertension,
anemia, and mineral bone disorder. Lower glomerular filtration rate also bears a 
strong relationship with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, end-stage
renal disease, and death. Patterns of CKD progression include linear and
nonlinear trajectories, but kidney function can remain stable for years in some
individuals. Addressing modifiable risk factors for the progression of CKD is
needed to attenuate its associated morbidity and mortality. Developing effective 
risk prediction models for CKD progression is critical to identify patients who
are more likely to benefit from interventions and more intensive monitoring.
Accurate risk-prediction algorithms permit systems to best align health care
resources with risk to maximize their effects and efficiency while guiding
overall decision making.

During the last 20 years, waiting lists for renal transplantation (RT) have grown
significantly older. However, elderly patients (ie ≥65 years of age) are still
more rarely referred or accepted to waiting lists and, if enlisted, have less
chances of actually receiving a kidney allograft, than younger counterparts. In
this review, we looked at evidence for the benefits and risks of RT in the
elderly trying to answer the following questions: Should RT be advocated for
elderly patients? What should be the criteria to accept elderly patients on the
waiting list for RT? What strategies might be used to increase the rate of RT in 
waitlisted elderly candidates? For selected elderly patients, RT was shown to be 
superior to dialysis in terms of patient survival. Virtually all guidelines
recommend that patients should not be deemed ineligible for RT based on age
alone, although a short life expectancy generally might preclude RT. Concerning
the assessment of comorbidities in the elderly, special attention should be paid 
to cardiac evaluation and screening for malignancy. Comorbidity scores and
frailty assessment scales might help the decision making on eligibility.
Psychosocial issues should also be evaluated. To overcome the scarcity of organ
donors, elderly RT candidates should be encouraged to consider expanded criteria 
donors and living donors, as alternatives to deceased standard criteria donors.
It has been demonstrated that expanded criteria donor RT in patients 60 years or 
older is associated with higher survival rates than remaining on dialysis,
whereas living donor RT is superior to all other options.

The incidence and prevalence of chronic renal disease (CKD) in elderly patients
are continuously increasing worldwide. Loss of renal function is not only
considered to be part of the aging process itself but also reflects the
multimorbidity of many geriatric patients. Calculating the glomerular filtration 
rate using specific algorithms validated for the elderly population and measuring
the amount of proteinuria allow an estimation of renal function in elderly
patients with high accuracy. Chronic renal failure has many clinical consequences
and not only results in a delayed excretion of toxins cleared by the kidneys but 
also affects hematogenesis, water and electrolyte balance as well as mineral bone
metabolism. Furthermore, CKD directly leads to and aggravates geriatric syndromes
and in particular the onset of frailty. Therapeutic strategies to halt
progression of CKD not only comprise treatment of the underlying disease but also
efficient blood pressure and diabetic control and the avoidance of nephrotoxic
medications.

IMPORTANCE: Efforts to improve end-of-life care have focused primarily on
patients with cancer. High-quality end-of-life care is also critical for patients
with other illnesses.
OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of end-of-life care and family-rated quality of
care for patients dying with different serious illnesses.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was
conducted in all 146 inpatient facilities within the Veteran Affairs health
system among patients who died in inpatient facilities between October 1, 2009,
and September 30, 2012, with clinical diagnoses categorized as end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), cancer, cardiopulmonary failure (congestive heart failure or
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), dementia, frailty, or other conditions.
Data analysis was conducted from April 1, 2014, to February 10, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Palliative care consultations, do-not-resuscitate
orders, death in inpatient hospices, death in the intensive care unit, and
family-reported quality of end-of-life care.
RESULTS: Among 57 753 decedents, approximately half of the patients with ESRD,
cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty received palliative care consultations
(adjusted proportions, 50.4%, 46.7%, and 43.7%, respectively) vs 73.5% of
patients with cancer and 61.4% of patients with dementia (P < .001).
Approximately one-third of patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or
frailty (adjusted proportions, 32.3%, 34.1%, and 35.2%, respectively) died in the
intensive care unit, more than double the rates among patients with cancer and
those with dementia (13.4% and 8.9%, respectively) (P < .001). Rates of excellent
quality of end-of-life care reported by 34 005 decedents' families were similar
for patients with cancer and those with dementia (adjusted proportions, 59.2% and
59.3%; P = .61), but lower for patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or
frailty (54.8%, 54.8%, and 53.7%, respectively; all P ≤ .02 vs patients with
cancer). This quality advantage was mediated by palliative care consultation,
setting of death, and a code status of do-not-resuscitate; adjustment for these
variables rendered the association between diagnosis and overall end-of-life care
quality nonsignificant.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Family-reported quality of end-of-life care was
significantly better for patients with cancer and those with dementia than for
patients with ESRD, cardiopulmonary failure, or frailty, largely owing to higher 
rates of palliative care consultation and do-not-resuscitate orders and fewer
deaths in the intensive care unit among patients with cancer and those with
dementia. Increasing access to palliative care and goals of care discussions that
address code status and preferred setting of death, particularly for patients
with end-organ failure and frailty, may improve the overall quality of
end-of-life care for Americans dying of these illnesses.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Older patients reaching ESRD have a higher risk of
adverse health outcomes. We aimed to determine the association of functional and 
cognitive impairment and frailty with adverse health outcomes in patients
reaching ESRD. Understanding these associations could ultimately lead to
prediction models to guide tailored treatment decisions or preventive
interventions.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web
of Science, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and COCHRANE for original studies
published until February 8, 2016 reporting on the association of functional or
cognitive impairment or frailty with adverse health outcome after follow-up in
patients reaching ESRD either with or without RRT.
RESULTS: Of 7451 identified citations, we included 30 articles that reported on
35 associations. Mean age was >60 years old in 73% of the studies, and geriatric 
conditions were highly prevalent. Twenty-four studies (80%) reported on
functional impairment, seven (23%) reported on cognitive impairment, and four
(13%) reported on frailty. Mortality was the main outcome measure in 29 studies
(97%), and one study assessed functional status trajectory. In 34 of 35 (97%)
associations reported, functional or cognitive impairment or frailty was
significantly and independently associated with adverse health outcomes. The
majority of studies (83%) were conducted in selected patient populations, mainly 
patients on incident dialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Functional and cognitive impairment and frailty in patients reaching
ESRD are highly prevalent and strongly and independently associated with adverse 
health outcomes, and they may, therefore, be useful for risk stratification. More
research into their prognostic value is needed.

The recent epidemiologic data pointed out, that the general number of patients on
hemodialysis is steadily increasing, especially in group of elderly patients over
75 years old. The geriatric syndromes are a multietiological disorder related to 
physiological aging and partly associated with comorbid conditions. Frailty,
falls, functional decline and disability, cognitive impairment and depression are
main geriatric syndromes and occurs in patients with impaired renal function more
often than among general population. The causes of higher prevalence of those
syndromes are not well known, but uremic environment and overall renal
replacement therapy may have an important impact on its progress. The patient
with geriatric syndrome require comprehensive treatment as well as physical
rehabilitation, psychiatric cure and support in everyday activities. Herein below
we would like to review recent literature regarding to particular features of
main geriatric syndromes in a group of nephrological patients.

BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation offers improved survival and quality of life
to an increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage kidney disease.
However, elderly kidney transplant recipients may face unique challenges due to a
higher burden of comorbidity, greater cumulative risk of
immunosuppression-related complications and increasing frailty. We aimed to
describe the perspectives of elderly kidney transplant recipients.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to April 2015. Qualitative studies
were eligible if they reported views from elderly kidney transplant recipients
(≥60 years). Thematic synthesis was used to analyse the findings.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies involving >116 recipients were included. We
identified seven themes. 'Regaining strength and vitality' meant valuing the
physical and psychosocial improvements in daily functioning and life
participation. 'Extending life' was the willingness to accept any organ,
including extended criteria kidneys, to prolong survival. 'Debt of gratitude'
entailed conscious appreciation toward their donor while knowing they were unable
to repay their sacrifice. 'Moral responsibility to maintain health' motivated
adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations out of an ethical duty to
protect their gift for graft survival. 'Unabating and worsening forgetfulness'
hindered self-management. 'Disillusionment with side effects and complications'
reflected disappointment and exasperation with the unintended consequences of
medications. 'Finality of treatment option' was an acute awareness that the
current transplant may be their last.
CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplantation was perceived to slow and even reverse the
experience of aging among elderly recipients, especially compared with dialysis. 
However, some were frustrated over persistent limitations after transplant,
struggled with the burden of medication side effects and worried about a possible
return to dialysis if the transplant failed. Clarifying patient expectations of
transplantation, providing support to alleviate the debilitating impacts of
immunosuppression and addressing fears about deteriorating health and graft
failure may improve satisfaction and outcomes in elderly kidney transplant
recipients.

Acute renal failure (ARF) in adults in the intensive care unit (ICU) often
evolves in a context of multiple organ failure, which explains the high mortality
rate and increase treatment needs. Among, two modalities of renal replacement
therapy, peritoneal dialysis (PD) was the first modality used for the treatment
of ARF in the 1950s. Today, while PD is generalized for chronic renal failure
treatment, its use in the ICU is limited, particularly, due to the advent of new 
hemodialysis techniques and the development of continuous replacement therapy.
Recently, a renewed interest in the use of PD in patients with ARF has manifested
in several emerging countries (Brazil, Vietnam). A systematic review in 2013
showed a similar mortality in ARF patients having PD (58%) and those treated by
hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration/hemofiltration (56.1%). In the International
society of peritoneal dialysis (ISPD)'s guideline (2013), PD may be used in adult
ARF as the other blood extracorporeal epuration technics (recommendation with
grade 1B). PD is the preferred method in cardiorenal syndromes, in frailty
patients with hemodynamic instability and those lacking vascular access; finally 
PD is also an option in elderly and patients with bleeding tendency. In
industrial countries, high volume automated PD with a flexible catheter (usually 
Tenckhoff) is advocated.

Antihypertensive treatment is aimed at reducing as much as possible health
outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality. The main international guidelines
and clinical trials showed different positions about blood pressure targets. At
present, there is no common opinion about the benefits of an aggressive drug
treatment; moreover it is not clear whether lower blood pressure values are
related to increased morbidity and mortality. The recent randomized SPRINT trial 
has compared intensive vs standard drug therapy in a non-diabetic hypertensive
population. The trial has shown benefits of intensive treatment in reducing
important health outcomes, though results were not confirmed in several patient
subsets. We examined the studies on hypertensive patients with comorbidities
(i.e., chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease) to identify blood pressure
targets recommended in these populations, but no strong evidence was found about 
the benefits of intensive treatment. In geriatric patients the "lower is better" 
paradigm cannot be entirely applied because of comorbidity, polypharmacy and
frailty.

BACKGROUND: Elderly patients have an increased risk for acute kidney injury
(AKI). However, few studies have reported on predictors for AKI in geriatric
patients. Therefore, we aimed at determining the effect of frailty as a predictor
of AKI.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 533 hospitalized elderly patients (aged ≥ 65
years) who had their creatinine levels measured (≥ 1 measurement) during
admission for a period of 1 year (2013) and conducted a comprehensive geriatric
assessment (CGA) within 1 year before the index hospitalization. We examined five
variables (activity of daily living [ADL] and instrumental ADL dependence,
dementia, nutrition, and polypharmacy) from CGA. We categorized the patients into
3 groups according to the tertile of aggregate frailty scores: Group 1, score
1-2; Group 2, score 3-4; Group 3, score 5-8).
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (10.1%) developed AKI (median duration, 4 days). The
frailest group (Group 3) showed an increased risk of AKI as compared to Group 1, 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 3.536, P = 0.002). We found that discriminatory accuracy for
AKI improved with the addition of the tertile of aggregate frailty score to
covariates (area under the receiver operator characteristics curves [AUROC]
0.641, AUROC 0.739, P = 0.004). Forty-six patients (8.6%) were transferred to
nursing facilities and 477 patients (89.5%) were discharged home. The overall
90-day and 1-year mortality for elderly inpatients were 7.9% and 26.3%. The
frailest group also demonstrated an increased risk of discharge to nursing
facilities, and 90-day and 1-year mortality as compared to Group 1, independent
of AKI severity (nursing facilities: odd ratio = 4.843, P = 0.002; 90-day
mortality: HR = 6.555, P = 0.002; 1-year mortality: HR = 3.249, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We found that frailty may independently predict the development of
AKI and adverse outcomes in geriatric inpatients.

In recent years, the concept of frailty as a "state of pre-disability" has been
widely accepted by those involved in the care of the elderly. Its importance lies
not only in its high prevalence - more than 25% in people over 85 years of age - 
but it is also considered an independent risk factor of disability,
institutionalisation and mortality amongst the elderly. The study of renal
function is relevant in patients with major comorbidities. Studies have shown a
significant association between chronic kidney disease and the development of
adverse clinical outcomes such as heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, increased susceptibility to infections and greater functional
impairment. Frailty can be reversed, which is why a study of frailty in patients 
with chronic kidney disease is of particular interest. This article aims to
describe the association between ageing, frailty and chronic kidney disease in
light of the most recent and relevant scientific publications.

AIM: The objective of this review was to assess chronic kidney disease-related
frailty and cognitive impairment, as well as their probable causes, mechanisms
and the interventions.
METHODS: Studies from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed to evaluate the relationship
between chronic kidney disease and physical frailty and cognitive impairment. Of 
the 1694 studies from the initial search, longitudinal studies (n = 22) with the 
keywords "Cognitive and CKD" and longitudinal or cross-sectional studies (n = 5) 
with the keywords "Frailty and CKD" were included in final analysis.
RESULTS: By pooling current research, we show clear evidence for a relationship
between chronic kidney disease and frailty and cognitive impairment in major
studies. Vascular disease is likely an important mediator, particularly for
cognitive impairment. However, non-vascular factors also play an important role. 
Many of the other mechanisms that contribute to impaired cognitive function and
increased frailty in CKD remain to be elucidated. In limited studies, medication 
therapy did not obtain the ideal effect. There are limited data on treatment
strategies, but addressing the vascular disease risk factors earlier in life
might decrease the subsequent burden of frailty and cognitive impairment in this 
population. Multidimensional interventions, which address both microvascular
health and other factors, may have substantial benefits for both the cognitive
impairments and physical frailty in this vulnerable population.
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic kidney disease is a potential cause of frailty and cognitive
impairment. Vascular and non-vascular factors are the possible causes. The
mechanism of chronic kidney disease-induced physical frailty and cognitive
impairment suggests that multidimensional interventions may be effective
therapeutic strategies in the early stage of chronic kidney disease. Geriatr

PURPOSE: Prognosis of the increasing number of elderly patients with end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) is poor with high risk of functional decline and mortality. 
Frailty seems to be a good predictor for those patients that will not benefit
from dialysis. Varying prevalences between populations are probably related to
the instrument used. The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence of
frailty among ESRD patients with two different validated instruments.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients, aged ≥18 years,
receiving hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis care between
September 2013 and December 2013 in a single dialysis center in Apeldoorn, the
Netherlands. Frailty was measured with the frailty index (FI) and frailty
phenotype (FP).
RESULTS: Prevalence of frailty by the FI was 36.8 % among 95 participants with
ESRD (age: 65.2 years, SD ± 12.0). Frailty prevalence among participants aged ≥65
and <65 years was 43.6 and 27.5 %, respectively. Female sex [odds ratio (OR) 3.3,
95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.3-8.0] and a Charlson comorbidity index score of 
≥5 (OR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.0-6.6) were associated with frailty. The FI identified
different but overlapping participants as frail compared with the FP; 62.5 % of
frail participants according to FI were also frail according to the FP.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of frailty among young and elderly ESRD patients is high;
being female and having more comorbidity was associated with frailty. Use of a
broader definition of frailty, like the FI, gives a higher estimation of
prevalence among ESRD patients compared with a physical frailty assessment.

Mitochondria abnormalities in skeletal muscle may contribute to frailty and
sarcopenia, commonly present in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Dysfunctional mitochondria are also a major source of oxidative stress and may
contribute to cardiovascular disease in CKD We tested the hypothesis that
mitochondrial structure and function worsens with the severity of CKD
Mitochondrial volume density, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, BNIP3, and
PGC1α protein expression were evaluated in skeletal muscle biopsies obtained from
27 subjects (17 controls and 10 with CKD stage 5 on hemodialysis). We also
measured mtDNA copy number in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma 
isofurans, and plasma F2-isoprostanes in 208 subjects divided into three groups: 
non-CKD (eGFR>60 mL/min), CKD stage 3-4 (eGFR 60-15 mL/min), and CKD stage 5 (on 
hemodialysis). Muscle biopsies from patients with CKD stage 5 revealed lower
mitochondrial volume density, lower mtDNA copy number, and higher BNIP3 content
than controls. mtDNA copy number in PBMCs was decreased with increasing severity 
of CKD: non-CKD (6.48, 95% CI 4.49-8.46), CKD stage 3-4 (3.30, 95% CI 0.85-5.75, 
P = 0.048 vs. non-CKD), and CKD stage 5 (1.93, 95% CI 0.27-3.59, P = 0.001 vs.
non-CKD). Isofurans were higher in patients with CKD stage 5 (median 59.21 pg/mL,
IQR 41.76-95.36) compared to patients with non-CKD (median 49.95 pg/mL, IQR
27.88-83.46, P = 0.001), whereas F2-isoprostanes did not differ among groups.
Severity of CKD is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and markers of
oxidative stress. Mitochondrial abnormalities, which are common in skeletal
muscle from patients with CKD stage 5, may explain the muscle dysfunction
associated with frailty and sarcopenia in CKD Further studies are required to
evaluate mitochondrial function in vivo in patients with different CKD stages.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is widely prevalent worldwide, with a special impact
on elderly population. Around half of people aged over 75 meet diagnostic
criteria for CKD according to the recent 'Kidney disease improving global
outcomes' (KDIGO) 2012 clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and
management of CKD. However, geriatric patients have characteristics that may not 
be addressed by general guidelines. Therefore, it is important to know the
natural history of the disease, symptoms, and 'red-flags' that could help in the 
management of these patients. In this review, a complete approach is presented on
the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of CKD in the geriatric population.

Skeletal muscle mass and muscle function are negatively affected by a variety of 
conditions inherent to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to dialysis treatment.
Skeletal muscle mass and function serve as indicators of the nutritional and
clinical state of CKD patients, and low values or derangements over time are
strong predictors of poor patient outcomes. However, muscle size and function can
be affected by different factors, may decline at different rates, and may have
different patient implications. Therefore, operational definitions of frailty and
sarcopenia have emerged to encompass these 2 dimensions of muscle health, i.e.,
size and functionality. The aim of this review is to appraise available methods
for assessment of muscle mass and functionality, with an emphasis on their
accuracy in the setting of CKD patients. We then discuss the selection of
reference cutoffs for defining conditions of muscle wasting and dysfunction.
Finally, we review definitions applied in studies addressing sarcopenia and
frailty in CKD patients and discuss their applicability for diagnosis and
monitoring.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify risk factors associated with
postoperative delirium in patients undergoing urological surgery.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated pre- and postoperative risk factors for
postoperative delirium in consecutive 215 patients who received urological
surgery between August 2013 and November 2014. Preoperative factors included
patient demographics, comorbidities, and frailty assessment. Frailty was measured
by handgrip strength, fatigue scale of depression, fall risk assessment, and gait
speed (the timed Get-up and Go test). Postoperative factors included types of
anesthesia, surgical procedure, renal function and serum albumin decline, blood
loss, surgery time, highest body temperature, and complications. Uni- and
multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess pre- and
postoperative predictors for the development of postoperative delirium.
RESULTS: Median age of this cohort was 67 years. Ten patients (4.7%) experienced 
postoperative delirium. These patients were significantly older, had weak
handgrip strength, a higher fall risk assessment score, slow gait speed, and
greater renal function decline compared with patients without delirium.
Multivariate analysis revealed slow gait speed (>13.0 s) and rapid renal function
decline (>30%) were independent risk factors for postoperative delirium.
CONCLUSIONS: Slow gait speed and rapid renal function decline after urological
surgery are significant factors for postoperative delirium. These data will be
helpful for perioperative patient management. This study was registered as a
clinical trial: UMIN: R000018809.

This paper extends dynamic prediction by landmarking to recurrent event data. The
motivating data comprised post-kidney transplantation records of repeated
infections and repeated measurements of multiple markers. At each landmark time
point ts, a Cox proportional hazards model with a frailty term was fitted using
data of individuals who were at risk at landmark s. This model included the
time-updated marker values at ts as time-fixed covariates. Based on a stacked
data set that merged all landmark data sets, we considered supermodels that allow
parameters to depend on the landmarks in a smooth fashion. We described and
evaluated four ways to parameterize the supermodels for recurrent event data.
With both the study data and simulated data sets, we compared supermodels that
were fitted on stacked data sets that consisted of either overlapping or
non-overlapping landmark periods. We observed that for recurrent event data, the 
supermodels may yield biased estimates when overlapping landmark periods are used
for stacking. Using the best supermodel amongst the ones considered, we
dynamically estimated the probability to remain infection free between ts and a
prediction horizon thor, conditional on the information available at ts.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With aging of the general population, patients who
enter dialysis therapy will more frequently have geriatric impairments and a
considerable comorbidity burden. The most vulnerable among these patients might
benefit from conservative therapy. Whether assessment of geriatric impairments
would contribute to the decision-making process of dialysis initiation is
unknown.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A systematic Medline and Embase
search was performed on December 1, 2015 to identify studies assessing the
association between risk of mortality or hospitalization and one or more
geriatric impairments at the start of dialysis therapy, including impairment of
cognitive function, mood, performance status or (instrumental) activities of
daily living, mobility (including falls), social environment, or nutritional
status.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were identified that assessed one or more geriatric
impairments with respect to prognosis. The quality of most studies was moderate. 
Only seven studies carried out an analysis of elderly patients (≥70 years old).
Malnutrition and frailty were systematically assessed, and their relation with
mortality was clear. In addition, cognitive impairment and functional outcomes at
the initiation of dialysis were related to an increased mortality in most
studies. However, not all studies applied systematic assessment tools, thereby
potentially missing relevant impairment. None of the studies applied a geriatric 
assessment across multiple domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric impairment across multiple domains at dialysis initiation 
is related to poor outcome. However, information in the elderly is sparse, and a 
systematic approach of multiple domains with respect to poor outcome has not been
performed. Because a geriatric assessment has proved useful in predicting outcome
in other medical fields, its potential role in the ESRD population should be the 
subject of future research.

BACKGROUND: In elderly patients, especially those older than 80 years, atrial
fibrillation (AF) is associated with an almost 25% increased risk of stroke.
Stroke prophylaxis with anticoagulants is therefore highly recommended. The
prevalence of factors that have been associated with a lower rate of prescription
and adherence to anticoagulant therapy in these patients is little known. The
objective of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics of elderly
subjects, with and without AF, consecutively admitted to an acute geriatric unit,
discussing factors that may decrease the persistence on stroke prophylaxis
therapy. We also highlight possible strategies to overcome the barriers
conditioning the current underuse of oral anticoagulants in this segment of the
population.
METHODS: A retrospective observational study was performed on a cohort of elderly
patients with and without AF admitted to the Acute Geriatric Unit of San Gerardo 
Hospital (Monza, Italy).
RESULTS: Compared to patients without AF (n = 1216), those with AF (n = 403) had 
a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (3 vs. 2, P < 0.001), number of administered 
drugs (4 vs. 3, P < 0.001), rate of heart failure (36.5% vs. 12%, P < 0.001) and 
chronic kidney disease (20.6 vs. 13.2, P < 0.001). Many patients with AF were
frail (54%) or pre-frail (29%).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with AF have higher rates of conditions that affect
adherence to traditional anticoagulant therapy (vitamin K antagonists, VKA). New 
direct oral anticoagulants (DOAs) can help overcome this problem. In order to
prescribe the most appropriate VKA or DOAs, with the best efficacy/safety profile
and the highest compliance, a comprehensive geriatric assessment should always
accompany the scores for thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk stratification.

There are several immunological and non-immunological factors related to renal
graft deterioration, and histological lesions such as interstitial fibrosis and
tubular atrophy overlap with those observed in aging kidneys. Consequently, it
has been proposed that kidney transplant senescence could contribute to graft
loss. The process of cell senescence displays characteristics such as an
increased expression of specific aging suppressor genes, shortened telomeres,
mitochondrial changes, increased expression of negative regulators of the cell
cycle, and immunological senescence. Additionally, tubular frailty characterizes 
the aged kidney, making it more susceptible to ischemia, reperfusion, toxic
injury, and consequently, to inflammation. Moreover, renal tissue injury
predisposes the older graft not only to progressive deterioration due to
glomerular hyperfiltration, but also triggers acute rejection due to increased
immunogenicity. In conclusion, renal graft senescence is a complex process, and
its better understanding will help the nephrologist in its management in order to
achieve a longer graft survival.

Patients with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis may present with
destructive spondyloarthropathy of the spine, most commonly in the subaxial
cervical and lumbar spine, often with severe stenosis and instability. However,
surgical management of these patients is challenging due to a high pseudarthrosis
rate, poor bone quality, and medical frailty. We present a 49-year-old man on
hemodialysis who presented with C4-C5 vertebral body destruction and a focal
kyphotic deformity with myelopathy. The patient underwent a 360 degree
decompression and reconstructive procedure that resulted in posterior
instrumentation failure. Several salvage techniques were used in order to
adequately stabilize the spine while preserving the patient's remaining cervical 
motion.

The aim of this study was to analyze procedural and postprocedural outcomes of
patients aged ≥80 years treated by transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) as enrolled in the OBservational
Study of Effectiveness of SAVR-TAVR procedures for severe Aortic steNosis
Treatment (OBSERVANT) Study. TAVI is offered to patients with aortic stenosis
judged inoperable or at high surgical risk. Nevertheless, it is common clinical
practice to treat elderly (≥80 years) patients by TAVI regardless of surgical
risk for traditional SAVR. OBSERVANT is a multicenter, observational, prospective
cohort study that enrolled patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who
underwent SAVR or TAVI from December 2010 to June 2012 in 93 Italian
participating hospitals. Information on demographic characteristics, health
status before intervention, therapeutic approach, and intraprocedural and 30-day 
outcomes was collected. An administrative follow-up was set up to collect data on
midterm to long-term outcomes. We reviewed baseline and procedural data of
patients aged ≥80 years, looking for different early and late outcome after TAVI 
or SAVR. Patients treated by TAVI were sicker than SAVR because of higher rate of
co-morbidities, advanced illness, frailty, and Logistic EuroSCORE. After
propensity matching, early and midterm mortality were comparable between the 2
groups. However, patients treated by TAVI had higher rate of vascular
complications (6.0% vs 0.5%; p <0.0001), permanent pacemaker implantation (13.4% 
vs 3.7%; p <0.0001), and paravalvular leak (8.9% vs 2.4%; p <0.0001). Patients
who underwent SAVR had more frequent bleedings needing transfusion (63.2% vs
34.5%; p <0.0001) and acute kidney injury (9.6% vs 3.9%; p = 0.0010). In
conclusion, patients aged ≥80 years treated by TAVI or SAVR had similar early and
midterm mortality.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising and is likely
to continue to do so for the foreseeable future, with the fastest growth seen
among adults ≥75 years of age. Elderly patients with advanced CKD are likely to
have a higher burden of comorbidity and frailty, both of which may influence
their disease outcome. For these patients, treatment decisions can be complex,
with the current lack of robust prognostic tools hindering the shared
decision-making process. The current study aims to assess the impact of
comorbidity and frailty on the outcomes of patients referred for pre-dialysis
education.
METHODS: We performed a single-centre study of patients (n = 283) referred for
pre-dialysis education between 2010 and 2012. The Charlson Comorbidity Index
(CCI) and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) were used to assess comorbid disease
burden and frailty, respectively. Follow-up data were collected until February
2015.
RESULTS: The CCI and CFS scores at the time of referral to the pre-dialysis
service were independent predictors of mortality. Within the study follow-up
period, 76% of patients with a high CFS score at the time of pre-dialysis
education had died, with 63% of these patients not commencing dialysis before
death.
CONCLUSION: A relatively simple frailty scale and comorbidity score could be used
to predict survival and better inform the shared decision-making process for
patients with advanced kidney disease.

BACKGROUND: Surgical risk scores do not include frailty assessments (eg, gait
speed), which are of particular importance for patients with severe aortic
stenosis considering transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We assessed the association of 5-m gait speed with outcomes 
in a cohort of 8039 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement
(November 2011-June 2014) and were included in the Society of Thoracic
Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry. We 
evaluated the association between continuous and categorical gait speed and
30-day all-cause mortality before and after adjustment for Society of Thoracic
Surgeons-predicted risk of mortality score and key variables. Secondary outcomes 
included in-hospital mortality, bleeding, acute kidney injury, and stroke. The
overall median gait speed was 0.63 m/s (25th-75th percentile, 0.47-0.79 m/s),
with the slowest walkers (<0.5 m/s) constituting 28%, slow walkers (0.5-0.83 m/s)
making up 48%, and normal walkers (>0.83 m/s) constituting 24% of the population.
Thirty-day all-cause mortality rates were 8.4%, 6.6%, and 5.4% for the slowest,
slow, and normal walkers, respectively (P<0.001). Each 0.2-m/s decrease in gait
speed corresponded to an 11% increase in 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio,
1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.22). The slowest walkers had 35% higher
30-day mortality than normal walkers (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence
interval, 1.01-1.80), significantly longer hospital stays, and a lower
probability of being discharged to home.
CONCLUSIONS: Gait speed is independently associated with 30-day mortality after
transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Identification of frail patients with the
slowest gait speeds facilitates preprocedural evaluation and anticipation of a
higher level of postprocedural care.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is related
to frailty and to characterize the nature of their joint association with
mortality.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis for frailty and longitudinal cohort analysis for
mortality.
SETTING: Cardiovascular Health Study.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals (N = 2,977; mean age 77.9 ± 4.7, 40%
male, 83% white).
MEASUREMENTS: The predictor was serum FGF-23 concentration (C-terminal
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and the outcomes were frailty status
(determined according to frailty phenotype criteria of weight loss, weakness,
exhaustion, slowness, and low physical activity) and mortality. Multinomial
logistic regression was used to assess the cross-sectional association between
FGF-23 and frailty and prefrailty, adjusting for demographic characteristics,
cardiovascular disease and risk factors, and kidney markers. Proportional hazards
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the association between
FGF-23, frailty, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 64 ± 17 mL/min per 
1.73 m(2) . Median FGF-23 was 70.3 RU/mL (interquartile range 53.4-99.2); 52%
were prefrail, and 13% were frail. After multivariate adjustment, each doubling
in FGF-23 concentration was associated with 38% (95% confidence interval (CI) =
17-62%) higher odds of frailty than of nonfrailty and 16% (95% CI = 3-30%) higher
odds of prefrailty. FGF-23 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.10-1.23) and
frailty (HR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.57-2.12) were independently associated with
mortality, but neither association was meaningfully attenuated when adjusted for 
the other.
CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of older adults, higher FGF-23 was independently
associated with prevalent frailty and prefrailty. FGF-23 and frailty were
independent and additive risk factors for mortality. FGF-23 may be a marker for
functional outcomes.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are
overrepresented in elderly patients. This provides specific challenges for the
treatment, as the start of dialysis in vulnerable elderly patients may be
associated with a rapid decline in functional performance. However, prognosis in 
elderly patients with ESRD is quite variable and related to the presence of
comorbidity and geriatric impairments. The decision to start dialysis in elderly 
patients should always be based on shared decision making, which may be aided by 
the use of prediction models which should however not be used to withhold
dialysis treatment. The treatment of ESRD in elderly patients should be based on 
a multidimensional treatment plan with a role for active rehabilitation.
Moreover, there also appears to be a reciprocal relationship between aging and
CKD, as the presence of geriatric complications is also high in younger patients 
with ESRD. This has led to the hypothesis of a premature aging process associated
with CKD, resulting in different phenotypes such as premature vascular aging,
muscle wasting, bone disease, cognitive dysfunction and frailty. Prevention and
treatment of this phenotype is based on optimal treatment of CKD, associated
comorbidities, and lifestyle factors by established treatments. For the future,
interventions, which are developed to combat the aging process in general, might 
also have relevance for the treatment of patients with CKD, but their role should
always be investigated in adequately powered clinical trials, as results obtained
in experimental trials may not be directly translatable to the clinical situation
of elderly patients. In the meantime, physical exercise is a very important
intervention, by improving both physical capacity and functional performance, as 
well as by a direct effect on the aging process.

Alto, California, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is the concept of accumulating physiologic declines
that make people less able to deal with stressors, including surgery.
Prehabilitation is intervention to enhance functional capacity before surgery.
Frailty and prehabilitation among transplant populations and the role of wearable
fitness tracking devices (WFTs) in delivering fitness-based interventions will be
discussed.
RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty is associated with increased complications, longer
length of hospital stay and increased mortality after surgery. Frail kidney
transplant patients have increased delayed graft function, mortality and early
hospital readmission. Frail lung or liver transplant patients are more likely to 
delist or die on the waitlist. Prehabilitation can mitigate frailty and has
resulted in decreased length of hospital stay and fewer postsurgical
complications among a variety of surgical populations. Increasingly, WFTs are
used to monitor patient activity and improve patient health. Interventions using 
WFTs have resulted in improved activity, weight loss and blood pressure.
SUMMARY: Frailty is a measurable parameter that identifies patients at risk for
worse health outcomes and can be mitigated through intervention. Prehabilitation 
to reduce frailty has been shown to improve postsurgical outcomes in a variety of
populations. WFTs are being integrated in healthcare delivery for monitoring and 
changing health behavior with promising results.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure (HBP) are commonly
associated conditions in the elderly population. An effect of treatments,
biologic and anthropometric variables on long-term mortality is unknown in this
population.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of HBP control in a sample of elderly
patients with type 2 diabetes with office blood pressure (BP) readings and
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and evaluate the influence of BP,
anthropometric and laboratory variables on long term mortality.
METHODS: Cohort study in patients living at home in the area of Sherbrooke, ≥65
years old, receiving reimbursement for antidiabetic medication. The study
included medical history, 2 sets of BP measurements, 2 24-hour urinary
collections for microalbuminuria, 1 24-hour ABPM, blood level of creatinine and
glycosylated hemoglobin. Charts were reanalyzed 8 years later for analysis of
cardiovascular and total mortality cases.
RESULTS: 198 patients were initially recruited. By history, 83% of the subjects
had diagnoses and treatments for high blood pressure. In multivariate analysis,
factors associated with an 8-year increased risk for cardiovascular mortality
were creatinine ≥84 µmol/L, office seated systolic blood pressure ≤130 and
diastolic BP ≤67.6 over 24 hours. Factors associated with total mortality were
lower waist circumference, serum creatinine ≥84 and diastolic BP ≤67.6 over 24
hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower systolic and diastolic BP (office and ABPM), lower waist
circumference and higher creatinine values are associated with an increased
mortality risk. This suggests that a lower BP, declining kidney function and
frailty are factors associated with this observation.

Inequalities between genders in access to transplantation have been demonstrated.
We aimed to validate this gender inequality in a large pediatric population and
to investigate its causes. This cohort study included 6454 patients starting
renal replacement therapy before 18 years old, in 35 countries participating in
the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology/European Renal
Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association Registry. We used
cumulative incidence competing risk and proportional hazards frailty models to
study the time to receive a transplant and hierarchical logistic regression to
investigate access to preemptive transplantation. Girls had a slower access to
renal transplantation because of a 23% lower probability of receiving preemptive 
transplantation. We found a longer follow-up time before renal replacement
therapy in boys compared with girls despite a similar estimated glomerular
filtration rate at first appointment. Girls tend to progress faster toward
end-stage renal disease than boys, which may contribute to a shorter time
available for pretransplantation workup. Overall, medical factors explained only 
70% of the gender difference. In Europe, girls have less access to preemptive
transplantation for reasons that are only partially related to medical factors.
Nonmedical factors such as patient motivation and parent and physician attitudes 
toward transplantation and organ donation may contribute to this inequality. Our 
study should raise awareness for the management of girls with renal diseases.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Monoclonal gammopathies (MGs) with renal involvement
can lead to ESRD caused by myeloma cast nephropathy (MCN), immunoglobulin light
chain amyloidosis (ALA), or light-chain deposition disease (LCDD). Few studies
have focused on the prognosis of patients with MG on chronic dialysis. We
evaluated the outcomes of patients with MG incident on chronic dialysis in
France.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: All incident patients registered
in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network Registry between 2002 and 2011 
with ESRD caused by ALA, LCDD, or MCN were included. Patient's survival, censored
for renal transplantation, renal recovery, and loss to follow-up, as well as
renal outcomes were analyzed and compared with a control group. Risk factors and 
causes of death were analyzed.
RESULTS: We included 1459 patients, comprising 265 (18%) patients with ALA, 334
(23%) patients with LCDD, and 861 (59%) patients with MCN. Median age was 72
years, and 56% were men. Median follow-up was 13.1 months. Renal recovery was
observed in 9.1% of patients and more frequent after 2006. Kidney transplantation
was rare in this population (2.3%). Among 1272 patients who remained on dialysis,
67% died. Median survival on dialysis was 18.3 months. Main causes of death were 
malignancies (34.4%), cardiovascular diseases (18%), infections (13.3%), and
cachexia (5.2%). Independent risk factors of death were age (hazard ratio [HR],
1.03 per year increase; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02 to 1.03), frailty 
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.36), congestive heart failure (HR, 1.54; 95% CI,
1.23 to 1.93), and dialysis initiation on a central catheter (HR, 1.40; 95% CI,
1.11 to 1.75). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were year of
dialysis initiation (HR, 0.95 per year increase; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.99) and high
BP (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with ALA, LCDD, or MCN on chronic dialysis is
poor but has improved over time. Progressive malignancy is the main cause of
death in this population. Renal recovery has increased since 2006.

The great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) are our closest
relatives. Despite the many similarities, there are significant differences in
aging among apes, including the human ape. Common to all are dental attrition,
periodontitis, tooth loss, osteopenia, and arthritis, although gout is uniquely
human and spondyloarthropathy is more prevalent in apes than humans. Humans are
more prone to frailty, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, longevity past reproductive
senescence, loss of brain volume, and Alzheimer dementia. Cerebral vascular
disease occurs in both humans and apes. Cardiovascular disease mortality
increases in aging humans and apes, but coronary atherosclerosis is the most
significant type in humans. In captive apes, idiopathic myocardial fibrosis and
cardiomyopathy predominate, with arteriosclerosis of intramural coronary
arteries. Similar cardiac lesions are occasionally seen in wild apes. Vascular
changes in heart and kidneys and aortic dissections in gorillas and bonobos
suggest that hypertension may be involved in pathogenesis. Chronic kidney disease
is common in elderly humans and some aging apes and is linked with cardiovascular
disease in orangutans. Neoplasms common to aging humans and apes include uterine 
leiomyomas in chimpanzees, but other tumors of elderly humans, such as breast,
prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers, are uncommon in apes. Among the apes,
chimpanzees have been best studied in laboratory settings, and more comparative
research is needed into the pathology of geriatric zoo-housed and wild apes.
Increasing longevity of humans and apes makes understanding aging processes and
diseases imperative for optimizing quality of life in all the ape species.

Frailty and Health-Related Quality of Life in End Stage Renal Disease Patients of
All Ages.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is associated with worse health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) in older adults and worse clinical outcomes in adults of all ages with
end stage renal disease (ESRD). It is unclear whether frail adults of all ages
with ESRD are more likely to experience worse HRQOL. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this 
study was to identify factors associated with worsening HRQOL in this population.
DESIGN, SETTING AND MEASUREMENTS: We studied 233 adults of all ages with ESRD
enrolled (11/2009-11/2013) in a longitudinal cohort study. Frailty status was
measured at enrollment and HRQOL was reported (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair
or Poor) at the initial assessment and follow-up (median follow-up 9.4 months).
We studied factors associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up using logistic
regression and factors associated with HRQOL change using multinomial regression.
All models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, BMI, diabetes status,
history of a previous transplant, type of dialysis and time between assessments. 
RESULTS: Fair/Poor HRQOL was reported by 28% at initial assessment and 33% at
follow-up. 47.2% of participants had stable HRQOL, 22.8% better HRQOL, and 30.0% 
worse HRQOL at follow-up (P<0.001). In adjusted models, only frailty was
associated with Fair/Poor HRQOL at follow-up (OR: 2.79, 95% CI: 1.32-5.90) and
worsening HRQOL at follow-up (RR: 2.91, 95%CI: 1.08-7.80). CONCLUSIONS: Frail
adults of all ages with ESRD are more likely to experience fair/poor HRQOL and
worsening HRQOL over time. Frailty represents a state of decreased physiologic
reserve that impacts not only clinical outcomes but also the patient-centered
outcome of HRQOL.

BACKGROUND: Conflicting results have been reported regarding impact of body mass 
index (BMI) on outcome of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients.
This study evaluates the impact of BMI on 1 year mortality in patients undergoing
TAVR via the transfemoral (TF) access.
METHODS: Aortic stenosis (AS) patients undergoing TAVR via a TF access between
May 2007 and December 2014 were categorized to 4 groups by BMI: low (<20), normal
(20-24.9), overweight (25-30), and obese (>30). Baseline parameters were
compared, and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were
generated to assess outcome differences.
RESULTS: Among 491 severe AS TAVR patients, 43 had low BMI, 148 had normal BMI,
162 were overweight, and 138 were obese. Obese patients were younger with lower
Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores and higher rates of preserved ejection
fraction and diabetes. There was a higher rate of women in the BMI extremes.
Aortic valve area was higher among obese patients; however, the indexed area was 
inversely correlated with BMI. Vascular complications and transfusions were more 
common in the low-BMI group, while acute kidney injury was more common in obese
patients. All-cause mortality at 1 year was higher in the low-BMI group (log-rank
p = 0.003) with no significant difference among normal and above-normal BMI
patients. In a multivariate model, BMI <20 kg/m(2) was an independent predictor
of mortality (HR = 2.45, p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: BMI <20 kg/m(2) should be considered a frailty marker during the
screening process of severe AS TAVR patients as it is associated with higher
mortality, while obesity confers similar mortality risk as normal weight. © 2015

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In-center hemodialysis (HD) is often the default
dialysis modality for older patients. Few centers use assisted peritoneal
dialysis (PD), which enables treatment at home. This observational study compared
quality of life (QoL) and physical function between older patients on assisted PD
and HD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Patients on assisted PD who were
>60 years old and on dialysis for >3 months were recruited and matched to
patients on HD (needing hospital transport) by age, sex, diabetes, dialysis
vintage, ethnicity, and index of deprivation. Frailty was assessed using the
Clinical Frailty Scale. QoL assessments included Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS), Short Form-12, Palliative Outcomes Symptom Scale (renal), Illness
Intrusiveness Rating Scale, and Renal Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire
(RTSQ). Physical function was evaluated by Barthel Score and timed up and go
test.
RESULTS: In total, 251 patients (129 PD and 122 HD) were recruited. In unadjusted
analysis, patients on assisted PD had a higher prevalence of possible depression 
(HADS>8; PD=38.8%; HD=23.8%; P=0.05) and higher HADS depression score (median:
PD=6; HD=5; P=0.05) but higher RTSQ scores (median: PD=55; HD=51; P<0.01). In a
generalized linear regression model adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, dialysis
vintage, and frailty, assisted PD continued to be associated with higher RTSQ
scores (P=0.04) but not with other QoL measures.
CONCLUSIONS: There are no differences in measures of QoL and physical function
between older patients on assisted PD and comparable patients on HD, except for
treatment satisfaction, which is higher in patients on PD. Assisted PD should be 
considered as an alternative to HD for older patients, allowing them to make
their preferred choices.

Kidney Transplantation Among the Elderly: Challenges and Opportunities to Improve
Outcomes.

Elderly patients (>65 years old) represent the fastest growing population among
the ESRD patients and those awaiting kidney transplantation. There is ample
evidence to suggest that kidney transplant in the elderly population offers the
best chance of survival and improves health-related quality of life compared to
remaining on dialysis. Although all these emerging facts are encouraging, this
population brings with them complex medical problems including frailty, cognitive
impairment, and multiple comorbidities. These issues can be barriers to
transplantation and threaten the well-being of the patients after
transplantation. Furthermore, aging results in changes to the immune system and
affects the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants. All these changes can
increase risk of complications such as infections and malignancy. Because death
with a functioning graft is a common cause of graft loss, the new kidney
allocation system has been implemented in an attempt to maximize allograft
utilization and minimize unrealized graft years. This may result in longer
wait-times for the elderly. In this review, we will highlight the barriers to
kidney transplant, characterize transplant-related issues in the elderly, and
propose alternative strategies under the new allocation system.

The number of patients with end-stage kidney disease 65 years and older is
growing, and this growth is expected to continue. The presence of medical
comorbidities, limited life expectancy, frailty, and poor functional status in
these patients poses substantial challenges in clinical decision-making and
provision of optimal care. Frailty is more common in elderly patients with CKD
than without and is associated with poor outcomes. Several prognostic tools were 
developed to estimate the rate of CKD progression among elderly, and risk of
mortality after dialysis initiation. Risk factors for CKD progression among
elderly include low estimated glomerular filtration rate, high baseline
proteinuria, acute kidney injury, low serum albumin, and presence of congestive
heart failure. The decision to initiate dialysis in the elderly should take into 
consideration life expectancy, risks and benefits of each dialysis modality,
quality of life, and patient and caregiver preferences. This article discusses
common issues in the elderly with end-stage kidney disease, with particular
emphasis on the impact of frailty and functional status, choice of dialysis
modality and vascular access, and prognosis after dialysis initiation, to assist 
the nephrologist in making decisions regarding optimal care for this complex
group of patients.

Consequences of aging are gaining clinical relevance. In transplantation, aging
and immunosenescence impact treatment and outcomes. The impact of aging, however,
will critically depend on distinguishing healthy, chronological aging from
biological aging that may result into frailty. Approximately 15% of individuals
older than 65 years are frail, and it is expected that this condition will gain
more clinical relevance with an expected increase to greater than 20% over the
next 5 years. Clearly, frailty impacts various general aspects of health care and
organ transplantation in particular including patient selection, waitlist
management and treatment after transplantation. In general, frailty has been
characterized by a compromised physiological reserve and an augmented
vulnerability. In comparison to healthy aging, inflammatory markers and cytokines
are increased in frail older adults. Thus, modifications of the immune response, 
in addition to physical limitations and changes of metabolism, are likely to
impact outcomes after transplantation. Here, we provide a risk assessment of
frailty at the time of transplant evaluation and review effects on outcomes and
recovery after transplantation. Moreover, we summarize our current understanding 
of the pathophysiology of frailty and consequences on immune responses and
metabolism.

Individuals aged over 70 years at the time of starting dialysis have a varied and
often challenging existence on dialysis. Canadian data suggest those starting
dialysis between the ages of 75 and 79 years will have an average life expectancy
of 3.2 years, while based on US data, patients can expect an average life
expectancy of 25 months. A substantial proportion of these patients will,
however, experience transient or permanent loss of personal independence within
the first few months to years on dialysis. Preliminary data from patients
recently started on peritoneal dialysis (PD) suggest patients and families adapt,
but that the adaptation often involves limiting activities and altering the
social role the patient has within the family. As data emerge, it will be
possible to hypothesize whether this adaptation is beneficial in the long term,
or whether these adaptations are permissive, allowing the patient to play a sick 
role leading to an accelerated transition to frailty and possibly death. Future
research will hopefully inform us whether the functional dependency can be
identified early and whether it is preventable. In the interim, repair rather
than prevention is possible through rehabilitation. We therefore advocate that
programs providing PD care consider the integration of protocols whereby patients
may undergo formal evaluation to identify those who would benefit from walking or
personal care aids, rehabilitation interventions, and, when needed, personal
support.

BACKGROUND: The dialysis population is aging worldwide. It is well known that
patients on dialysis have limited functional status, but only recently has
frailty been considered.
SUMMARY: The prevalence of frailty among patients on dialysis ranges from 3.4- to
10-fold higher than among community-dwelling elderly, depending on the method of 
assessing frailty and patient characteristics. Despite its high prevalence and
the high overall mortality in the dialysis population, frailty is associated with
higher mortality, independent of clinical and demographic characteristics and
comorbidity. The prevalence of frailty among patients with non-dialysis-dependent
chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also high, and cross-sectional data suggest that 
the prevalence may increase as CKD progresses. Thus, interventions to improve
frailty have the potential to improve quality of life and mortality. Although
interventions to improve physical dysfunction have been successful in the
population with end-stage renal disease, no studies have specifically targeted
frail individuals. Therefore, the extent to which exercise or physical activity
interventions are feasible among frail patients and can improve frailty urgently 
needs to be examined. In the meantime, providers should refer frail patients to
physical therapists and encourage them to be more active if possible. In
addition, more attention should be focused on the possibility that rehabilitation
among patients with earlier stages of CKD could improve dialysis outcomes.
KEY MESSAGES: Frailty is extremely common among patients on dialysis and is
independently associated with adverse outcomes. Providers should take advantage
of available resources to improve functioning in this population, and research
should address the optimal strategy for addressing frailty, including timing of
intervention.

BACKGROUND: Use of serum creatinine to estimate GFR may lead to underestimation
of the association between self-reported frailty and kidney function. Our
objectives were to evaluate the association of measured GFR (mGFR) with
self-reported frailty among patients with CKD and to determine whether
self-reported frailty was associated with death after adjusting for mGFR.
METHODS: Participants in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study
(1989-1993) had GFR measured using iothalamate clearance (mGFR), and GFR was
estimated based on the CKD-EPI creatinine (eGFRcr) and cystatin C (eGFRcys)
equations. We defined self-reported frailty as three or more of: exhaustion, poor
physical function, low physical activity, and low body weight. Death was
ascertained through 2007 using the National Death Index and the United States
Renal Data System.
RESULTS: Eight hundred twelve MDRD participants (97 %) had complete data on
self-reported frailty (16 % prevalence, N = 130) and mGFR (mean (SD) 33.1 ± 11.7 
ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Higher GFR was associated with lower odds of self-reported
frailty based on mGFR, (OR 0.71, 95 % CI 0.60-0.86 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)),
eGFRcr (OR 0.80, 95 % CI 0.67-0.94 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), and eGFRcys (OR
0.75, 95 % CI 0.62-0.90 per 10 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Median follow-up was 17 (IQR
11-18) years, with 371 deaths. Self-reported frailty was associated with a higher
risk of death (HR 1.71, 95 % CI 1.26-2.30), which was attenuated to a similar
degree when mGFR (HR 1.48, 95 % CI 1.08-2.00), eGFRcr (HR 1.57, 95 % CI
1.15-2.10), or eGFRcys (HR 1.51, 95 % CI 1.10-2.10) was included as an indicator 
of kidney function.
CONCLUSIONS: We found an inverse association between kidney function and
self-reported frailty that was similar for mGFR, eGFR and eGFRcys. In this
relatively healthy cohort of clinical trial participants with CKD, using serum
creatinine to estimate GFR did not substantially alter the association of GFR
with self-reported frailty or of self-reported frailty with death.

BACKGROUND: Assessment of physical frailty is important among elderly with severe
aortic stenosis (AS) when considering treatment.
AIMS: We aimed to: (1) investigate the prevalence of physical frailty in older
people with severe AS and (2) examine factors related to physical frailty.
METHODS: A total of 125 consecutive elderly AS patients (mean age
84.6 ± 4.4 year) were enrolled. Physical frailty was defined as scoring ≤8 points
on the short physical performance battery (SPPB). Factors likely related to
physical frailty, including cardiac function, nutritional and metabolic status,
kidney function, medical history, and comorbidities, were evaluated. Logistic
regression analyses were used to examine which factors were related to physical
frailty.
RESULTS: Physical frailty was prevalent in 38.4 %. After sex and age adjusted,
the following were significantly related to physical frailty: LVEF (adjusted OR
per 10 % decrease: 1.39, p < 0.05), the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form
(adjusted OR per 1 point decrease: 1.21, p < 0.05), serum albumin (adjusted OR
per 1 g/dL decrease: 2.64, p < 0.05), HDL-C (adjusted OR per 10 mg/dL decrease:
1.52, p < 0.01), eGFR (adjusted OR per 10 mL/min decrease: 1.59, p < 0.05), grip 
strength (adjusted OR per 10 kg decrease: 3.60, p < 0.01), coronary heart disease
(adjusted OR: 2.78, p < 0.01), cerebrovascular disease (adjusted OR: 6.06,
p < 0.01), and musculoskeletal disorders (adjusted OR: 3.28, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of physical frailty is high and related to
nutritional status, comorbidities, and cardiac status.

Intermediate- or low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis were excluded from
earlier transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) clinical trials; however, 
they are already being treated by TAVI despite a lack of data regarding the
safety and efficacy in these patients. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy
of TAVI in patients at intermediate or low risk. Patients undergoing TAVI during 
2008 to 2014 were included into a shared database (n = 1,327). Procedural
outcomes were adjudicated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 2
definitions. Patients were stratified according to their Society of Thoracic
Surgeons (STS) score into 3 groups: high (STS ≥8, n = 223, 17%), intermediate
(STS 4 to 8; n = 496, 38%), or low risk (STS <4; n = 576, 45%). Low-risk patients
were significantly younger and more likely to be men compared to intermediate-
and high-risk patients. Baseline characteristics differed significantly between
the groups with a gradual increase in the rates of previous bypass surgery,
stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, lung disease, and frailty
scores, from low to high risk groups. Compared with intermediate- and high-risk
patients, low-risk patients were more likely to undergo TAVI through the
transfemoral route (81% vs 88% vs 95%, p <0.001) and under conscious sedation
(69% vs 72% vs 81%, <0.001). There were no significant differences in the rates
of procedural complications apart from acute kidney injury (19% vs 17% vs 13%, p 
= 0.03) and stroke rates (4.5% vs 2% vs 2.3%, p = 0.1). Short- and long-term
mortality rates were significantly higher for intermediate- (hazard ratio [HR]
1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 2.9) and high-risk patients (HR 4.1, 95%
CI 2.7 to 6.4) than low-risk patients also after multivariate adjustment (HR 1.6,
95% CI 1 to 2.6 and HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 4.5, respectively; all p <0.05). In
conclusion, TAVI for intermediate- and low-risk patients is safe and associated
with improved outcome compared with high-risk patients.

Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of complexity, which is an
essential condition for making the organism capable of keeping homeostasis. Thus,
senile loss of complexity makes old individuals frail: a syndrome characterized
by the presence of shrinking (sarcopenia), weakness, poor endurance and energy,
slowness, and low physical activity. Moreover, renal ageing progressively leads
to a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) reduction, one of the main pharmacokinetic 
senile changes, which is not detectable by simply evaluating serum urea or
creatinine values but measuring or calculating patient's GFR. Finally, current
epidemiology has documented that detrimental social-behavioral factors such as
low education level, poor financial-resource, depression, and isolation, also
influence the onset and progression of chronic diseases, and even overall
mortality, particularly in the elderly. Thus, we propose that these 3 variables: 
frailty phenotype, senile GFR, and detrimental social-behavioral factors, should 
be considered at time of prescribing drugs or medical procedures in the elderly. 
Additionally, they should also be considered for following patient's response to 
prescribed therapies in elderly patients suffering from chronic diseases
(diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, etc.), or on organ replacement
treatments (dialysis and transplantation).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients of all ages undergoing hemodialysis (HD) have
a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and worse cognitive function than
healthy controls, and those with dementia are at high risk of death. Frailty has 
been associated with poor cognitive function in older adults without kidney
disease. We hypothesized that frailty might also be associated with poor
cognitive function in adults of all ages undergoing HD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: At HD initiation, 324 adults
enrolled (November 2008 to July 2012) in a longitudinal cohort study (Predictors 
of Arrhythmic and Cardiovascular Risk in ESRD) were classified into three groups 
(frail, intermediately frail, and nonfrail) based on the Fried frailty phenotype.
Global cognitive function (3MS) and speed/attention (Trail Making Tests A and B
[TMTA and TMTB, respectively]) were assessed at cohort entry and 1-year
follow-up. Associations between frailty and cognitive function (at cohort entry
and 1-year follow-up) were evaluated in adjusted (for sex, age, race, body mass
index, education, depression and comorbidity at baseline) linear (3MS, TMTA) and 
Tobit (TMTB) regression models.
RESULTS: At cohort entry, the mean age was 54.8 years (SD 13.3), 56.5% were men, 
and 72.8% were black. The prevalence of frailty and intermediate frailty were
34.0% and 37.7%, respectively. The mean 3MS was 89.8 (SD 7.6), TMTA was 55.4 (SD 
29), and TMTB was 161 (SD 83). Frailty was independently associated with lower
cognitive function at cohort entry for all three measures (3MS: -2.4 points; 95% 
confidence interval [95% CI], -4.2 to -0.5; P=0.01; TMTA: 12.1 seconds; 95% CI,
4.7 to 19.4; P<0.001; and TMTB: 33.2 seconds; 95% CI, 9.9 to 56.4; P=0.01; all
tests for trend, P<0.001) and with worse 3MS at 1-year follow-up (-2.8 points;
95% CI, -5.4 to -0.2; P=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: In adult incident HD patients, frailty is associated with worse
cognitive function, particularly global cognitive function (3MS).

INTRODUCTION: People with intellectual disabilities (ID) are earlier frail than
people in the general population. Although this may be explained by lifelong
unfavourable social, psychological and clinical causes, underlying physiological 
pathways might be considered too. Biological measures can help identify
pathophysiological pathways. Therefore, we examined the association between
frailty and a range of serum markers on inflammation, anaemia, the metabolic
system, micronutrients and renal functioning.
METHODS: Participants (n = 757) with borderline to severe ID (50+) were recruited
from three Dutch ID care and support services.
RESULTS: Frailty was measured with a frailty index, a measure based on the
accumulation of deficits. Linear regression analyses were performed to identify
associations between frailty and biochemical measures independent of age, gender,
level of ID and the presence of Down syndrome. Frailty appears associated with
inflammation (IL-6 and CRP), anaemia, metabolic markers (glucose, cholesterol and
albumin) and renal functioning (cystatin-C and creatinine).
DISCUSSION: These results are in line with results observed in the general
population. Future research needs to investigate the causal relation between
biochemical measures and frailty, with a special focus on inflammation and
nutrition. Furthermore, the possibility to screen for frailty using biochemical
measures needs to be used.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Frailty is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a
predictor of adverse outcomes. The current article reviews the most common
frailty measures available, gives an overview of their use in the chronic kidney 
disease population, and summarizes their strengths and limitations.
RECENT FINDINGS: Frailty is increasingly recognized as a potent predictor of
adverse outcomes in all stages of chronic kidney disease. Recent investigations
have demonstrated that the clinical perception of frailty by healthcare personnel
or patients themselves is an inaccurate measure of frailty. The clinical frailty 
scale, a simple point-of-care tool for the assessment of frailty, has been shown 
to be a predictor of mortality in individuals on dialysis.
SUMMARY: The Fried criteria have been most extensively used in chronic kidney
disease. However, other criteria using self-reported outcomes, clinical and
cognitive criteria have also been shown to predict adverse outcomes and may be
more applicable in clinical settings. Many of these still require further
validation in the chronic kidney disease population.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the natural history of frailty after an aggressive
surgical intervention, kidney transplantation (KT).
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study (December 2008-March 2014).
SETTING: Baltimore, Maryland.
PARTICIPANTS: Kidney transplantation recipients (N = 349).
MEASUREMENTS: The Fried frailty score was measured at the time of KT and during
routine clinical follow-up. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, factors
associated with improvements in frailty score after KT were identified. Using a
longitudinal analysis, predictors of frailty score changes after KT were
identified using a multilevel mixed-effects Poisson model.
RESULTS: At KT, 19.8% of recipients were frail; 1 month after KT, 33.3% were
frail; at 2 months, 27.7% were frail; and at 3 months, 17.2% were frail. On
average, frailty scores had worsened by 1 month (mean change 0.4, P < .001),
returned to baseline by 2 months (mean change 0.2, P = .07), and improved by 3
months (mean change -0.3, P = .04) after KT. The only recipient or transplant
factor associated with improvement in frailty score after KT was pre-KT frailty
(hazard ratio = 2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.71-3.82, P < .001). Pre-KT
frailty status (relative risk (RR) = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.29-1.72, P < .001),
recipient diabetes mellitus (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.08-1.46, P = .003), and
delayed graft function (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04-1.43, P = .02) were
independently associated with long-term changes in frailty score.
CONCLUSION: After KT, in adult recipients of all ages, frailty initially worsens 
but then improves by 3 months. Although KT recipients who were frail at KT had
higher frailty scores over the long term, they were most likely to show
improvements in their physiological reserve after KT, supporting the
transplantation in these individuals and suggesting that pretransplant frailty is
not an irreversible state of low physiological reserve.

Frailty is a construct originally coined by gerontologists to describe cumulative
declines across multiple physiological systems that occur with aging and lead
individuals to a state of diminished physiological reserve and increased
vulnerability to stressors. Fried et al. provided a standardized definition for
frailty, and they created the concept of frailty phenotype which incorporates
disturbances across interrelated domains (shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and
energy, slowness, and low physical activity level) to indentify old people who
are at risk of disability, falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, and
premature death. Some authors consider the presence of lean mass reduction
(sarcopenia) as part of the frailty phenotype. The frailty status has been
documented in 7 % of elderly population and 14 % of not requiring dialysis CKD
adult patients. Sarcopenia increases progressively along with loss of renal
function in CKD patients and is high in dialysis population. It has been
documented that prevalence of frailty in hemodialysis adult patients is around 42
% (35 % in young and 50 % in elderly), having a 2.60-fold higher risk of
mortality and 1.43-fold higher number of hospitalization, independent of age,
comorbidity, and disability. The Clinical Frailty Scale is the simplest and
clinically useful and validated tool for doing a frailty phenotype, while the
diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on muscle mass assessment by body imaging
techniques, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle strength evaluated with a handheld 
dynamometer. Frailty treatment can be based on different strategies, such as
exercise, nutritional interventions, drugs, vitamins, and antioxidant agents.
Finally, palliative care is a very important alternative for very frail and sick 
patients. In conclusion, since the diagnosis and treatment of frailty and
sarcopenia is crucial in geriatrics and all CKD patients, it would be very
important to incorporate these evaluations in pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
hemodialysis, and kidney transplant patients in order to detect and consequently 
treat the frailty phenotype in these groups.

Elderly patients receiving a kidney from old donors (old-to-old) are a growing
population of transplant recipients. This population cumulates risks of
complications due to the co-morbidities and the immunodeficiency state and the
frailty of the recipients together with the kidney senescence of the donors. In
this context, the choice of immunosuppression is complicated and must take into
account some contradictory principles explaining why no consensus exists today.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a state of physiological vulnerability common in the
elderly. It is more predominant in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease in
comparison to healthy subjects, which can also be diagnosed in non-elderly
individuals and be associated with innumerous causes such as muscle strength,
body composition and inflammation. The association between frailty and
endothelial function, as well as the association between frailty and the combined
outcome of mortality multiple cause and start of renal replace therapy were
assessed.
METHODS: In the initial analysis, sixty-one predialysis patients with Chronic
Kidney Disease stages were evaluated and included in this study. Due to patient
drop-out during follow-up, fifty-seven patients were subsequently re-evaluated 12
months later. The diagnosis of frailty was based on the Johansen et al. (J Am Soc
Nephrol 18(11):2960-67, 2007) criteria. The groups were divided into Non-frail
and Frail. Sociodemographic, inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, CRP-us),
endothelial dysfunction (flow-mediated vasodilatation - FMD), body composition
(DXA) and the 25-hidroxi-vitamin D parameters were analyzed.
RESULTS: The average age of the patients used in the study was 64.9 ± 10.3 years 
old. The predominance of frailty was 42.6%, of which 46% were non-elderly. After 
some adjustments, frailty was associated with gender (OR = 11.32; IC 95% = 2.30
to 55.67), advanced age (OR = 4.07; IC 95% = 1.02 to 16.20), obesity (OR = 6.63; 
IC 95% = 0.82 to 11.44) and endothelial dysfunction (OR = 3.86; IC 95% = 1.00 to 
14.88). The ratio of the incidence of frail subjects to the variable outcome was 
2.5 (CI 95%, 1.04 to 6.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Although an observational study does not allow one to determine the 
casual relation between frailty and endothelial dysfunction, we conclude that
frailty was predominant in our sample of Brazilian patients with chronic kidney
disease on predialysis, even in elderly individuals. This was linked to either
worse endothelial function or mortality.

BACKGROUND: Although frailty has been linked to higher risk of falls and fracture
in the general population, only few studies have examined the extent to which
frailty is associated with these outcomes among patients with end-stage renal
disease, who are at particularly high risk for these events.
METHODS: A total of 1,646 patients who were beginning maintenance hemodialysis in
297 dialysis units throughout the United States from September 2005 to June 2007 
were enrolled in the Comprehensive Dialysis Study, and 1,053 Medicare
beneficiaries were included in this study. Self-reported frailty was defined by
the patients endorsing 2 or more of the following: poor physical functioning,
exhaustion or low physical activity. Falls and fractures requiring medical
attention were identified through Medicare claims data. We examined the
association between frailty and the time to first fall or fracture using the
Fine-Gray modification of Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for
demographics, Quételet's body mass index, diabetes mellitus, heart failure and
atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent of patients were frail by self-report. The median 
length of follow-up was 2.5 (1.0-3.9) years. Crude rates of first medically
urgent falls or fractures were 66 and 126 per 1,000 person-years in non-frail and
self-reported frail participants, respectively. After accounting for demographic 
factors, comorbidities and the competing risk of death, self-reported frailty was
associated with a higher risk of falls or fractures requiring medical attention
(hazards ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.16-2.20).
CONCLUSION: Participants reporting frailty experienced nearly twice the risk of
medically urgent falls or fractures compared to those who did not report frailty.

In the last decade, an increasing number of patients over 75 years of age are
starting renal replacement therapy. Frailty is highly prevalent in elderly
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the context of the increased
prevalence of some ESRD-associated conditions: protein-energy wasting,
inflammation, anaemia, acidosis or hormonal disturbances. There are currently no 
hard data to support guidance on the optimal duration of dialysis for
frail/elderly ESRD patients. The current debate is not about starting dialysis or
managing conservatory frail ESRD patients, but whether a more intensive regimen
once dialysis is initiated (for whatever reasons and circumstances) would improve
patients' outcome. The most important issue is that all studies performed with
extended/alternative dialysis regimens do not specifically address this
particular type of patients and therefore all the inferences are derived from the
general ESRD population. Care planning should be responsive to end-of-life needs 
whatever the treatment modality. Care in this setting should focus on symptom
control and quality of life rather than life extension. We conclude that, similar
to the general dialysed population, extensive application of more intensive
dialysis schedules is not based on solid evidence. However, after a thorough
clinical evaluation, a limited period of a trial of intensive dialysis could be
prescribed in more problematic patients.

Stroke prevention in elderly atrial fibrillation patients remains a challenge.
There is a high risk of stroke and systemic thromboembolism but also a high risk 
of bleeding if anticoagulants are prescribed. The elderly have increased chronic 
kidney disease, coronary artery disease, polypharmacy, and overall frailty. For
all these reasons, anticoagulant use is underutilized in the elderly. In this
manuscript, the benefits of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants compared
with warfarin in the elderly patient population with multiple comorbid conditions
are reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Frailty, a manifestation of unsuccessful aging, is highly prevalent
in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with comorbid
conditions in cross-sectional studies. Longitudinal studies investigating the
progression of frailty in those with advanced non-dialysis CKD are lacking.
OBJECTIVES: Canadian Frailty Observation and Interventions Trial (CanFIT). To
determine the natural history, prevalence of perceived and measured frailty and
its association with dialysis treatment choices and adverse outcomes in patients 
with advanced CKD.
DESIGN: Longitudinal observational study, designed to collect data from 600
participants over 2 years.
SETTING: Interprofessional non-dialysis CKD clinics at four tertiary health care 
centres in central Canada.
PATIENTS: People with CKD stage 4 and 5 (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) who are not
on dialysis at enrollment.
MEASUREMENTS: Multiple Frailty Definitions: Short Physical Performance Battery
(SPPB), Fried Frailty Criteria, Frailty Index. Dialysis start: In-Centre
Hemodialysis, Home Hemodialysis or Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes: Death, Opt-out
or Lost to follow up.
METHODS: We will perform physical and cognitive assessments annually. We plan to 
analyze the relationships between frailty, treatment choices and patient centered
outcomes.
RESULTS: We have recruited 217 participants in 2 centres; of these, 56 % had
reduced physical function at baseline, as defined by the SPPB. Risk of reduced
physical function was 8 fold higher in those with diabetes after adjusting for
age, gender, eGFR and comorbidities.
LIMITATIONS: Referred population, use of SPPB as a measure of frailty,
inter-operator variability in measurement of hand grip and gait speed,
cross-sectional analysis of baseline data in the subset recruited to date.
CONCLUSIONS: People with advanced CKD have a high burden of reduced physical
function, especially those with diabetes. We will continue enrollment into the
CanFIT study to further understand the clinical history of CKD and frailty in
this population.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established technique for
the treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Data on long-term TAVI
outcomes, both hemodynamic and clinical, in real-world practice settings are
limited. We aim to explore the long-term clinical results in patients with severe
symptomatic aortic stenosis using multiple catheter-based options: 360
TAVI-treated patients were followed up for ≤5 years. The Medtronic CoreValve was 
used in 71% and the Edwards SAPIEN in 26%. The primary end point was all-cause
mortality during follow-up. Outcomes were assessed based on the Valve Academic
Research Consortium 2 criteria. The mean ± SD patient age was 82.1 ± 6.9 years
(56.4% women). The Society of Thoracic Surgeons score was 7.5 ± 4.7. The clinical
efficacy end point and time-related valve safety at 3 years was 50% and 81.7%,
respectively. The calculated 3- and 5-year survival rates were 71.6% and 56.4%,
respectively. Five-year follow-up data were obtained for 54 patients alive; 96.2%
of alive patients were in the New York Heart Association class I and II, 4 years 
after TAVI. No gender differences in all-cause mortality rates were observed (p =
0.58). In multivariate analysis, hospitalization 6 months previous to TAVI
(hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17 to 3.15, p = 0.01),
frailty (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.2, p = 0.02), acute kidney injury (HR 1.93,
95% CI 1.03 to 3.61, p = 0.04), and moderate or more paravalvular aortic
regurgitation after TAVI (HR 4.26, 95% CI 2.54 to 7.15, p <0.001) were
independent predictors for all-cause mortality. In conclusion, long-term outcomes
of TAVI are encouraging. Prevention and early identification of paravalvular leak
and acute renal failure after the procedure would improve short- and long-term
outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Currently over 55% of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are
aged ≥60 years and patients >75 years represent the fastest growing segment of
the dialysis population. We aimed to assess whether the Groningen frailty
indicator (GFI) can be used to distinguish fit older ESRD patients, likely able
to tolerate and benefit from dialysis, from frail older patients who need further
evaluation with a geriatrician's comprehensive assessment.
METHODS: All patients aged ≥65 years visiting the pre-dialysis unit at the Gelre 
hospital between 2007 and 2013 were included and underwent the GFI (n = 65).
Patients with GFI ≥ 4 (frail) were referred for geriatric consultation (n = 13). 
Results of the GFI and nephrologists' evaluation were compared with
geriatrician's assessment. Survival rates and outcomes after one year of follow
up were recorded.
RESULTS: Twenty patients (32%) were identified as frail. Of the problems
identified by the geriatrician in 13 patients, 55% were not reported in the
nephrologists' notes. The first year after inclusion, 30% of patients with a
GFI ≥ 4 died, compared to 9% of fit patients (p = 0.04). Moreover, 90% of frail
patients had been hospitalized one or more times, compared to 53% in the fit
group (p = 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Although the GFI can be a useful instrument to identify ESRD patients
at risk, both the GFI and the nephrologists' assessment failed to identify
specific geriatric impairments. Further research is needed to develop a specific 
frailty indicator for ESRD patients and to determine the value and effect of a
comprehensive geriatric assessment in ESRD patients.

AIM: To determine whether the frailty status of patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) can be measured using a Frailty index (FI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven attending a nephrology clinic were approached to 
complete a one-page questionnaire evaluating cognitive, psychological and
functional status. Data were coded as deficits, summed and divided by the total
number of deficits considered, to derive an FI-CKD.
RESULTS: One hundred and ten (mean age 65.2 years) agreed to participate and
assessments took approximately 10 minutes to complete. Mean FI-CKD was 0.25 (SD
0.12). The FI-CKD increased with age at 3% per year, correlated with a modified
Fried phenotype (P < 0.001) and increased significantly across CKD stages (P =
0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The FI-CKD is feasible in the outpatient setting and has good
construct validity. The greater granularity of a continuous measure has the
potential to inform decision-making regarding appropriate interventions for
patients at the 'frail' end of the health spectrum.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between performance on a single chair
stand and moderate to severe exertional dyspnea.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Cardiovascular Health Study.
PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and older (N = 4,413; mean
age 72.6; female, n = 2,518 (57.1%); nonwhite, n = 199 (4.5%); obese, n = 788
(17.9%); history of smoking, n = 2,410 (54.6%)).
MEASUREMENTS: Performance on single chair stand (poor (unable to rise without arm
use) vs normal (able to rise without arm use)), moderate to severe exertional
dyspnea (American Thoracic Society grade ≥2), age, sex, ethnicity, obesity,
smoking, frailty status (Fried-defined nonfrail, prefrail, frail), high
cardiopulmonary risk (composite of cardiopulmonary diseases and diabetes
mellitus), spirometric impairment, arthritis, depression, stroke, and kidney
disease.
RESULTS: Poor performance on the single chair stand was established in 369 (8.4%)
and moderate to severe exertional dyspnea in 773 (17.5%). Prefrail status was
established in 2,210 (50.1%), frail status in 360 (8.2%), arthritis in 2,241
(51.4%), high cardiopulmonary risk in 2,469 (55.9%), spirometric impairment in
1,076 (24.4%), kidney disease in 111 (2.5%), depression in 107 (2.4%), and stroke
in 93 (2.1%). In multivariable regression models, poor performance on the single 
chair stand was associated with moderate to severe exertional dyspnea (unadjusted
odds ratio (OR) = 3.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.78-4.36; adjusted OR =
1.85, 95% CI = 1.41-2.41).
CONCLUSION: Poor performance on a single chair stand was associated with an
adjusted 85% greater likelihood of moderate to severe exertional dyspnea than
normal performance. These results suggest that reduced proximal muscle function
of the lower extremities is associated with moderate to severe exertional
dyspnea, even after adjusting for multiple confounders.

OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively validate and compare a modified frailty index
predicting adverse outcomes and other risk stratification tools among patients
undergoing urologic oncological surgeries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program was queried from 2005 to 2013 to identify patients undergoing
cystectomy, prostatectomy, nephrectomy, and nephroureterectomy. Using the
Canadian Study of Health and Aging Frailty Index, 11 variables were matched to
the database; 4 were also added because of their relevance in oncology patients. 
The incidence of mortality, Clavien-Dindo IV complications, and adverse events
were assessed with patients grouped according to their modified frailty index
score.
RESULTS: We identified 41,681 patients who were undergoing surgery for presumed
urologic malignancy. Patients with a high frailty index score of >0.20 had a 3.70
odds of a Clavien-Dindo IV event (CI: 2.865-4.788, P<0.0005) and a 5.95 odds of
30-day mortality (CI: 3.72-9.51, P<0.0005) in comparison with nonfrail patients
after adjusting for race, sex, age, smoking history, and procedure. Using
C-statistics to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the predictive ability
of different models per risk stratification tool and the Akaike information
criteria to assess for the fit of the models with the data, the modified frailty 
index was comparable or superior to the Charlson comorbidity index but inferior
to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class in predicting 30-day
mortality or Clavien-Dindo IV events. When the modified frailty index was
augmented with the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class, the new
index was superior in all aspects in comparison to other risk stratification
tools.
CONCLUSION: Existing risk stratification tools may be improved by incorporating
variables in our 15-point modified frailty index as well as other factors such as
walking speed, exhaustion, and sarcopenia to fully assess frailty. This is
relevant in diseases such as kidney and prostate cancer, where surveillance and
other nonsurgical interventions exist as alternatives to a potentially
complicated surgery. In these scenarios, our modified frailty index augmented by 
the American Society of Anesthesiologists Risk Class may help inform which
patients have increased surgical complications that may outweigh the benefit of
surgery although this index needs prospective validation.

BACKGROUND: The number of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease opting
for conservative management rather than dialysis is unknown but likely to be
growing as increasingly frail patients with advanced renal disease present to
renal services. Conservative kidney management includes ongoing medical input and
support from a multidisciplinary team. There is limited evidence concerning
patient and carer experience of this choice. This study will explore quality of
life, symptoms, cognition, frailty, performance decision making, costs and impact
on carers in people with advanced chronic kidney disease managed without dialysis
and is funded by the National Institute of Health Research in the UK.
METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, longitudinal study, patients will be
recruited in the UK, by renal research nurses, once they have made the decision
not to embark on dialysis. Carers will be asked to 'opt-in' with consent from
patients. The approach includes longitudinal quantitative surveys of quality of
life, symptoms, decision making and costs for patients and quality of life and
costs for carers, with questionnaires administered quarterly over 12 months.
Additionally, the decision making process will be explored via qualitative
interviews with renal physicians/clinical nurse specialists.
DISCUSSION: The study is designed to capture patient and carer profiles when
conservative kidney management is implemented, and understand trajectories of
care-receiving and care-giving with the aim of optimising palliative care for
this population. It will explore the interactions that lead to clinical care
decisions and the impact of these decisions on informal carers with the intention
of improving clinical outcomes for patients and the experiences of care givers.

Elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years old) use up to 30% of all commonly prescribed
medication, and they suffer more their adverse effects than the general
population. In order to minimize this risk, physicians should avoid polypharmacy,
dangerous pharmacological interactions and take into account pharmacodynamic and 
senile pharmacokinetic changes before prescribing any medication to the elderly. 
The present review article originally describes how renal physiology changes
secondary to aging such as dysautonomia, glomerular filtration rate reduction,
tubular back-filtration, sodium, calcium and magnesium loss, potassium retention,
altered dilution-concentration capability, tubular frailty, genetics, internal
milieu and body composition are senile changes that when combined predispose
elderly people to suffer from pharmacological adverse effects. Knowledge of these
physiological modifications associated with aging and their impact on the
pharmacology of particular drugs may help to optimize drug use and to avoid
complications in this age group.

It is known that the common physiological denominator of the ageing process is an
attenuation of functional performance with respect to the situation of young
people and adults. However, since the first cohort-based longitudinal studies, it
has not been possible to establish a "linear" relationship between age and
glomerular filtration in all cases. This does not mean that there is no
physiological ageing process at all; in addition to those already elucidated, its
mechanisms include cell senescence, podocyte dysfunction, a vitamin D deficiency,
and homozygotic forms of the MYH9 gene. The aim of the present work was to
analyse the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and, where possible, the
correlation between CKD, defined by an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), plasma
25(OH)D3 levels and the MYH9 gene in a population of elderly and very elderly
persons. These parameters have not been evaluated previously in populations of
elderly and very elderly patients. It is concluded that a moderate decrease in
the eGFR occurs with age. This does not imply the presence of CKD in elderly
people, since in most individuals the reduced eGFR is not accompanied by anaemia,
and no individuals show hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia or a high Alb/Cr ratio.
Here we observed a lower Hb level and an elevated Alb/Cr ratio in subjects
heterozygotic for the MYH9 gene. This could be interpreted in the sense that the 
gene could exert some protective effect on renal function, whereas the
heterozygotic form (allele A) of the MYH9 gene could be considered a very early
marker, a new risk factor for the appearance of CKD, or a sign of renal frailty
in elderly people.

The elderly population is increasing worldwide and shows an increasing prevalence
of frailty. Frailty is recognized as an important factor for inappropriate drug
prescribing in elderly patients. Appropriate drug prescription, either in terms
of drug choice or in terms of drug dosage, is of paramount importance among the
frail elderly patients, this requiring the need of a difficult balance between
efficacy, safety and tolerability. Bacterial infections are quite frequent among 
the elderly, and use of antimicrobials may be associated with severe adverse
events in this population, especially when in presence of co-medications and/or
of co-morbidities. The aim of this paper is to argue about the most recent
published evidences on how to prevent major adverse events whenever
antimicrobials should be co-prescribed in frail elderly patients.

This study aims to identify at the expression level the immune-related genes
associated with IPN-susceptible and resistant phenotypes in Atlantic salmon
full-sibling families. We have analyzed thirty full-sibling families infected by 
immersion with IPNV and then classified as resistant or susceptible using a
multivariate survival analysis based on a gamma-Cox frailty model and the
Kaplan-Meier mortality curves. In four families within each group head kidneys
were pooled for real-time PCR and one-color salmon-specific oligonucleotide
microarray (21K) analysis at day 1 and 5 post-infection. Transcripts involved in 
innate response (IL-6, IFN-α), antigen presentation (HSP-70, HSP-90, MHC-I), TH1 
response (IL-12, IFN-γ, CRFB6), immunosuppression (IL-10, TGF-β1) and leukocyte
activation and migration (CCL-19, CD18) showed a differential expression pattern 
between both phenotypes, except in IL-6. In susceptible families, except for
IFN-γ, the expressions dropped to basal values at day 5 post-infection. In
resistant families, unlike susceptible families, levels remained high or
increased (except for IL-6) at day 5. Transcriptomic analysis showed that both
families have a clear differential expression pattern, resulting in a marked
down-regulation in immune related genes involved in innate response, complement
system, antigen recognition and activation of immune response in IPN-resistant.
Down-regulation of genes, mainly related to tissue differentiation and protein
degradation metabolism, was also observed in resistant families. We have
identified an immune-related gene patterns associated with susceptibility and
resistance to IPNV infection of Atlantic salmon. This suggests that a limited
immune response is associated with resistant fish phenotype to IPNV challenge
while a highly inflammatory but short response is associated with susceptibility.

BACKGROUND: Dental disease is more extensive in adults with chronic kidney
disease, but whether dental health and behaviors are associated with survival in 
the setting of hemodialysis is unknown.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multinational cohort.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 4,205 adults treated with long-term hemodialysis, 2010 to
2012 (Oral Diseases in Hemodialysis [ORAL-D] Study).
PREDICTORS: Dental health as assessed by a standardized dental examination using 
World Health Organization guidelines and personal oral care, including
edentulousness; decayed, missing, and filled teeth index; teeth brushing and
flossing; and dental health consultation.
OUTCOMES: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality at 12 months after dental
assessment.
MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models
fitted with shared frailty to account for clustering of mortality risk within
countries.
RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 22.1 months, 942 deaths occurred, including
477 cardiovascular deaths. Edentulousness (adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.51) 
and decayed, missing, or filled teeth score ≥ 14 (adjusted HR, 1.70; 95% CI,
1.33-2.17) were associated with early all-cause mortality, while dental flossing,
using mouthwash, brushing teeth daily, spending at least 2 minutes on oral
hygiene daily, changing a toothbrush at least every 3 months, and visiting a
dentist within the past 6 months (adjusted HRs of 0.52 [95% CI, 0.32-0.85], 0.79 
[95% CI, 0.64-0.97], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58-0.99], 0.84 [95% CI, 0.71-0.99], 0.79
[95% CI, 0.65-0.95], and 0.79 [95% CI, 0.65-0.96], respectively) were associated 
with better survival. Results for cardiovascular mortality were similar.
LIMITATIONS: Convenience sample of clinics.
CONCLUSIONS: In adults treated with hemodialysis, poorer dental health was
associated with early death, whereas preventive dental health practices were
associated with longer survival.

BACKGROUND: The elderly form an expanding proportion of patients with chronic
kidney disease and end-stage renal disease worldwide. The increased physiological
frailty and functional morbidity associated with the aging process pose unique
challenges when planning optimal management of an older patient needing renal
replacement therapy (RRT).
AIMS: This position paper discusses current evidence regarding the optimal
management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly with an emphasis on
hemodialysis since it is the most common modality used in older patients. Further
research is needed to define relevant patient-reported outcome measures for
end-stage renal disease including functional assessments and psychological
impacts of various forms of RRT. For those older patients who have opted for
dialysis treatment, it is important to study the strategies that encourage
greater uptake of home-based dialysis therapies and optimal vascular access.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of advanced chronic kidney disease in the elderly can
be challenging but also extremely rewarding. The key issue is adopting a
patient-focused and individualized approach that seeks to achieve the best
outcomes based on a comprehensive holistic assessment of what is important to the
patient.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older people, but it is
unclear if it affects survival and rehabilitation outcomes independent of
comorbid conditions and physical function in this population.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort analysis of prospective, routinely collected, linked
clinical data sets.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients discharged from a single inpatient geriatric
rehabilitation center over a 12-year period.
PREDICTORS: Admission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) category as a
predictor of improvement in the 20-point Barthel score (activities of daily
living measure) during rehabilitation; discharge eGFR category and Barthel score 
as predictors of survival postdischarge.
OUTCOMES: Survival postdischarge was modeled using Cox regression analyses,
unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, morbidities (ischemic heart disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, diabetes, and heart failure),
Barthel score and eGFR category on discharge, and serum calcium, hemoglobin, and 
albumin levels. The effect of admission eGFR category on change in Barthel score 
during admission was modeled using analysis of covariance, adjusted for
admission, Barthel score, and comorbid conditions.
RESULTS: 3,012 patients were included; mean age, 84 years. 2,394 patients died
during a mean follow-up of 8.3 years. Compared with patients with eGFR of 60 to
89mL/min/1.73m(2), adjusted HRs for death were 1.26 (95% CI, 1.13-1.40), 1.45
(95% CI, 1.29-1.63), and 1.68 (95% CI, 1.42-1.99) for eGFR categories of 45 to
59, 30 to 44, and <30mL/min/1.73m(2), respectively. The relationship between
discharge Barthel score and survival was similar within each discharge eGFR
category (HRs of 0.95, 0.93, 0.92, 0.95, and 0.90 per Barthel score point within 
eGFR categories of ≥90, 60-89, 45-59, 30-44, and <30mL/min/1.73m(2); P for
interaction = 0.2). Similar improvements in Barthel score between admission and
discharge were seen for each admission eGFR category.
LIMITATIONS: Single-center study using routinely collected clinical data.
CONCLUSIONS: eGFR category and Barthel score are independent risk markers for
survival in older rehabilitation patients, but advanced CKD does not preclude
successful rehabilitation.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive and lifelong condition 
with multiple medical comorbidities. Patients with CKD experience frailty more
frequently and have lower health-related quality of life than do those with other
chronic diseases. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
frailty and investigate the contribution of frailty to quality of life in
pre-dialysis CKD patients in Korea.
METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected at an
outpatient CKD clinic in a general hospital in Korea. The frailty criterion was
modified from previous studies. The Short Form-36 Health Survey version 2 was
used to measure physical and mental component summary scores. Data were analyzed 
using chi-square, t-tests, and hierarchical linear regression.
RESULTS: Of the 168 CKD patients, 63 (37.5 %) were frail. Frail patients were
significantly older and had lower physical and mental quality of life than those 
who were non-frail. In hierarchical regression evaluating the influence of
frailty on physical and mental quality of life, the initial model was
significantly improved when frailty was included. Frail patients had lower
physical and mental quality of life.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty affected both physical and mental quality of life in
pre-dialysis patients with CKD. More attention should be paid to the potential
role of early detection and prevention of frailty to improve patients' quality of
life.

Are currently GFR estimating equations and standard Kt/V value adequate for
advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) frail elderly patients?

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) elderly patients have a reduced glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) due to the combination of ageing and chronic nephropathy
damage. This situation is very important to be taken into account in order to
prescribe an adequate medication and dialysis dose in this aged group. Besides,
cognitive and urinary incontinence problems make difficult to obtain an adequate 
24-h urine collection in order to evaluate creatinine clearance in this group.
Thus, a reliable GFR estimating equation would be very useful for assisting
elderly CKD patients. Additionally, Kt/V is the main parameter currently used for
dosing dialysis in stage V CKD young and elderly patients. However, frailty and
sarcopenia are prevalent disorders usually suffered by old people, who also
present many physiological changes that could make GFR estimating equations and
standard Kt/V value to become unreliable in this particular group. In conclusion,
based on all these facts, it seems crucial for clinical geriatric nephrology to
carefully evaluate how reliable current GFR estimating equations are, as well as 
which would be an adequate Kt/V value in CKD frail elderly patients.

Muscle wasting (or sarcopenia) is a common feature of the uremic phenotype and
predisposes this vulnerable patient population to increased risk of comorbid
complications, poor quality of life, frailty and premature death. The old age of 
dialysis patients is in addition a likely contributor to loss of muscle mass. As 
recent evidence suggests that assessment of muscle strength (i.e. function) is a 
better predictor of outcome and comorbidities than muscle mass, this opens new
screening, assessment and therapeutic opportunities. Among established treatment 
strategies, the benefit of resistance exercise and endurance training are
increasingly recognized among nephrologists as being effective and should be
promoted in sedentary chronic kidney disease patients. Testosterone and growth
hormone replacement appear as the most promising among emerging treatments
strategies for muscle wasting. As treatment of muscle wasting is difficult and
seldom successful in this often old, frail, sedentary and exercise-hesitant
patient group, novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. In this review, we
summarize recent studies on stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, myogenic
stem (satellite) cells and manipulation of transforming growth factor family
members, all of which hold promise for more effective therapies to target muscle 
mass loss and function in the future.

This chapter provides an overview of the important factors to be considered
during the decision making process of recommending a lipid altering medication to
an older patient. To date, in the elderly age group, as in the younger age group,
the only effective therapy with lipid altering medication proven to reduce
cardiovascular risk is a lowering of the concentration of cholesterol containing 
atherogenic particles via lipid altering therapies The definition of “elderly”
may be arbitrary, but most authors refer to elderly patients as age 65 years or
older. From the point of view of lipid lowering, elderly patients can be
classified in two groups: Patients age 65 to 74 years, in whom there is strong
evidence of benefit of cholesterol lowering. In these patients, the decision
making process depends only on the evaluation of cardiovascular risk in the
patient without known cardiovascular disease, and the risk versus benefit in
patients with significant non-cardiovascular comorbidity. Patients age 75 years
and older, in whom there is no direct evidence of benefit or lack thereof for
cholesterol lowering. In these patients, the clinician makes a recommendation to 
the patient and his family based on the evaluation of multiple factors, including
the risk of atherosclerotic versus non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,
comorbidity burden, lifestyle/socioeconomic status, and presence of frailty. In
this group, the ultimate decision for lipid altering therapy is based on patient 
preference. In this chapter, we present the clinical trial evidence for the
younger elderly age group and the knowledge necessary for the evaluation of risk 
versus benefit for the older elderly age group.

The identification of a patient at high risk of fracture should be followed by
evaluation for factors contributing to low bone mass, skeletal fragility, falls, 
and fractures. Components of the evaluation include a bone density test,
osteoporosis-directed medical history and physical exam, laboratory studies, and 
possibly skeletal imaging. A bone density test with dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) helps with diagnostic classification, assessment of fracture
risk, and provides a baseline for monitoring the skeletal effects of treatment.
FRAX is a fracture risk algorithm that includes input of femoral neck bone
mineral density measured by DXA. The DXA T-score and FRAX estimation of fracture 
risk are used with clinical practice guidelines to determine whether treatment is
indicated. The medical history may reveal underlying causes of osteoporosis
(e.g., nutritional deficiencies, gastric surgery, medications with adverse
skeletal effects) and important risk factors for fracture (e.g., past history of 
fracture, family history of osteoporosis, or recent falls). Physical exam may
show skeletal deformities due to unrecognized fractures (e.g., loss of height,
kyphosis, or diminished rib-pelvis space), identify possible secondary causes of 
skeletal fragility (e.g., blue sclera with osteogenesis imperfecta, urticarial
pigmentosa with systemic mastocytosis, or bone tenderness with osteomalacia), and
help to recognize patients with poor balance and frailty that might lead to
falls. Laboratory studies may show potentially reversible abnormalities (e.g.,
vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, or impaired kidney function) that must be
assessed and corrected, if possible, before starting pharmacological therapy.
Disorders other than osteoporosis, requiring other types of treatment, may be
found; for example, low serum alkaline phosphatase suggests hypophosphatasia,
M-component may be due to myeloma, or hypocalciuria due to celiac disease. There 
are important safety considerations that can be derived from a pre-treatment
assessment, as well. A patient with a blood clotting disorder should not be
treated with raloxifene, a history of esophageal stricture is a contraindication 
for oral bisphosphonates, and previous skeletal radiation therapy precludes
treatment with teriparatide. Skeletal imaging may be helpful when a fracture,
malignancy, or Paget’s disease of bone is suspected. Bone biopsy is rarely
performed in clinical practice, but may be helpful in some situations, such as
when it is necessary to determine the underlying bone disease in a patient with
stage 5 chronic kidney disease. For complete coverage of all related areas of

BACKGROUND: Frailty, a validated measure of physiologic reserve, predicts adverse
health outcomes among adults with end-stage renal disease. Frailty typically is
not measured clinically; instead, a surrogate-perceived frailty-is used to inform
clinical decision-making. Because correlations between perceived and measured
frailty remain unknown, the aim of this study was to assess their relationship.
METHODS: 146 adults undergoing hemodialysis were recruited from a single dialysis
center in Baltimore, Maryland. Patient characteristics associated with perceived 
(reported by nephrologists, nurse practitioners (NPs), or patients) or measured
frailty (using the Fried criteria) were identified using ordered logistic
regression. The relationship between perceived and measured frailty was assessed 
using percent agreement, kappa statistic, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and 
prevalence of misclassification of frailty. Patient characteristics associated
with misclassification were determined using Fisher's exact tests, t-tests, or
median tests.
RESULTS: Older age (adjusted OR [aOR] = 1.36, 95%CI:1.11-1.68, P = 0.003 per
5-years older) and comorbidity (aOR = 1.49, 95%CI:1.27-1.75, P < 0.001 per
additional comorbidity) were associated with greater likelihood of
nephrologist-perceived frailty. Being non-African American was associated with
greater likelihood of NP- (aOR = 5.51, 95%CI:3.21-9.48, P = 0.003) and patient-
(aOR = 4.20, 95%CI:1.61-10.9, P = 0.003) perceived frailty. Percent agreement
between perceived and measured frailty was poor (nephrologist, NP, and patient:
64.1%, 67.0%, and 55.5%). Among non-frail participants, 34.4%, 30.0%, and 31.6%
were perceived as frail by a nephrologist, NP, or themselves. Older adults (P <
0.001) were more likely to be misclassified as frail by a nephrologist; women (P 
= 0.04) and non-African Americans (P = 0.02) were more likely to be misclassified
by an NP. Neither age, sex, nor race was associated with patient
misclassification.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceived frailty is an inadequate proxy for measured frailty among 
patients undergoing hemodialysis.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the latest information on body composition among 
patients with chronic kidney disease and its association with outcomes.
RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity is increasing among patients with end-stage renal
disease and is more prevalent when direct measures of adiposity are used rather
than BMI. High BMI is not associated with better survival among patients with
earlier chronic kidney disease or after kidney transplantation, suggesting that
excess fat is most protective among the sickest patients. Despite the positive
association between BMI and survival among patients with end-stage renal disease,
visceral fat is associated with coronary artery calcification and adverse
cardiovascular events. Muscle wasting is prominent among patients with chronic
kidney disease, sometimes even in the setting of obesity. Obesity and muscle
wasting are associated with worse physical functioning. Indicators of low muscle 
size and strength are associated with higher mortality. Some interventions can
affect body composition, but whether they affect survival has not been
determined.
SUMMARY: Recent studies show that a high BMI is not protective for all patients
with chronic kidney disease and is associated with poor physical functioning and 
frailty. Visceral adiposity is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
Sarcopenia is common among patients with end-stage renal disease and is
associated with worse physical performance and higher mortality.

BACKGROUND: The usage of nursing home (NH) services is a marker of frailty among 
older adults. Although the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) revised
the Medical Evidence Report Form CMS-2728 in 2005 to include data collection on
NH institutionalization, the validity of this item has not been reported.
METHODS: There were 27,913 patients ≥ 75 years of age with incident end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) in 2006, which constituted our analysis cohort. We
determined the accuracy of the CMS-2728 using a matched cohort that included the 
CMS Minimum Data Set (MDS) 2.0, often employed as a "gold standard" metric for
identifying patients receiving NH care. We calculated sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for the
CMS-2728 NH item. Next, we compared characteristics and mortality risk by
CMS-2728 and MDS NH status agreement.
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of the CMS-2728 for NH status 
were 33%, 97%, 80% and 79%, respectively. Compared to those without the MDS or
CMS-2728 NH indicator (No MDS/No 2728), multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (95%
confidence interval) for mortality associated with NH status were 1.55 (1.46 -
1.64) for MDS/2728, 1.48 (1.42 - 1.54) for MDS/No 2728, and 1.38 (1.25 - 1.52)
for No MDS/2728. NH utilization was more strongly associated with mortality than 
other CMS-2728 items in the model.
CONCLUSIONS: The CMS-2728 underestimated NH utilization among older adults with
incident ESRD. The potential for misclassification may have important
ramifications for assessing prognosis, developing advanced care plans and
providing coordinated care.

Aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of chronic diseases such as
arthritis, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, Alzheimer's
disease, macular degeneration, frailty, and certain forms of cancers. It is
widely regarded that chronic inflammation may be a common link in all these
age-related diseases. This raises the question, can one alter the course of aging
and potentially slow the development of all chronic diseases by manipulating the 
mechanisms that cause age-related inflammation? Emerging evidence suggests that
pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18 show an age-dependent
regulation implicating inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation in the aging
process. The Nod-like receptor (NLR) family of innate immune cell sensors, such
as the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin
domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome controls the caspase-1 activation in
myeloid-lineage cells in several organs during aging. The NLRP3 inflammasome is
especially relevant to aging as it can get activated in response to structurally 
diverse damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as extracellular ATP,
excess glucose, ceramides, amyloids, urate, and cholesterol crystals, all of
which increase with age. Interestingly, reduction in NLRP3-mediated inflammation 
prevents age-related insulin resistance, bone loss, cognitive decline, and
frailty. NLRP3 is a major driver of age-related inflammation and therefore
dietary or pharmacological approaches to lower aberrant inflammasome activation
holds promise in reducing multiple chronic diseases of age and may enhance
healthspan.

Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are life-threatening
complications after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Only
half of CD20-positive PTLDs respond to rituximab monotherapy, and outcomes remain
poor for patients with relapsed/refractory disease, especially those who do not
qualify for an anthracycline containing regimen due to frailty or comorbidities. 
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) might be an option in this particular setting. We report
a panel of eight patients with rituximab refractory/relapsed CD20-positive PTLDs 
including three ineligible for subsequent CHOP-like chemotherapy who received
(90) Y-Ibritumomab tiuxetan as a single agent (n = 7) or combined to chemotherapy
(n = 1). Five out of eight patients were kidney transplant recipients, while 2/8 
had a liver transplant and 1/8 had a heart transplant. Patients received a median
of two previous therapies. Overall response rate was 62.5%. Importantly, all
responders achieved complete response. At a median follow-up of 37 months [5;
84], complete response was ongoing in four patients. Toxicity was predominantly
hematological and easily manageable. No graft rejection was noticed concomitantly
or following RIT administration despite immunosuppression reduction after
diagnosis of PTLDs. This report emphasizes the potential efficiency of salvage
RIT for early rituximab refractory PTLDs without any unexpected toxicity.

Controlling Time-Dependent Confounding by Health Status and Frailty: Restriction 
Versus Statistical Adjustment.

McGrath LJ, Ellis AR, Brookhart MA.

Nonexperimental studies of preventive interventions are often biased because of
the healthy-user effect and, in frail populations, because of confounding by
functional status. Bias is evident when estimating influenza vaccine
effectiveness, even after adjustment for claims-based indicators of illness. We
explored bias reduction methods while estimating vaccine effectiveness in a
cohort of adult hemodialysis patients. Using the United States Renal Data System 
and linked data from a commercial dialysis provider, we estimated vaccine
effectiveness using a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model of
all-cause mortality before and during 3 influenza seasons in 2005/2006 through
2007/2008. To improve confounding control, we added frailty indicators to the
model, measured time-varying confounders at different time intervals, and
restricted the sample in multiple ways. Crude and baseline-adjusted marginal
structural models remained strongly biased. Restricting to a healthier population
removed some unmeasured confounding; however, this reduced the sample size,
resulting in wide confidence intervals. We estimated an influenza vaccine
effectiveness of 9% (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.15)
when bias was minimized through cohort restriction. In this study, the
healthy-user bias could not be controlled through statistical adjustment;
however, sample restriction reduced much of the bias.

BACKGROUND: Falls among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have
significant consequences for quality of life and functional independence,
morbidity, healthcare utilization and even mortality, but studies on the etiology
of falls within large HD cohorts are limited.
METHODS: Falls during the past 12 months were ascertained for a prevalent
multi-center HD cohort (n = 762) aged 20-92 years, and associations with
demographic and treatment characteristics, comorbidities, cognitive function,
prescribed medications, balance tests, frailty and depressive symptoms were
assessed.
RESULTS: Falls were sustained by 28.4% of participants. In multivariable-adjusted
analyses, participants classified as frail were over two times more likely to
report falls [odds ratio (OR): 2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-4.71, P =
0.01], and participants with a CES-D score 18+ and/or prescribed antidepressants 
were over 80% more likely to be fallers (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.23-2.74, P = 0.003) 
than were participants with a CES-D score <18 and no prescribed antidepressants.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty and depressed mood, factors that are potentially modifiable,
are prominently associated with falls.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is a state of metabolic and
nutritional derangements in chronic disease states including chronic kidney
disease (CKD). Cumulative evidence suggests that PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia
are common and strongly associated with mortality in CKD, which is reviewed here.
RECENT FINDINGS: The malnutrition-inflammation score (KALANTAR Score) is among
the comprehensive and outcome-predicting nutritional scoring tools. The
association of obesity with poor outcomes is attenuated across more advanced CKD 
stages and eventually reverses in the form of obesity paradox. Frailty is closely
associated with PEW, muscle wasting and cachexia. Muscle loss shows stronger
associations with unfavorable outcomes than fat loss. Adequate energy
supplementation combined with low-protein diet for the management of CKD may
prevent the development of PEW and can improve adherence to low-protein diet, but
dietary protein requirement may increase with aging and is higher under dialysis 
therapy. Phosphorus burden may lead to poor outcomes. The target serum
bicarbonate concentration is normal range and at least 23 mEq/l for
nondialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent CKD patients, respectively. A
benefit of exercise is suggested but not yet conclusively proven.
SUMMARY: Prevention and treatment of PEW should involve individualized and
integrated approaches to modulate identified risk factors and contributing
comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: The levels of many laboratory parameters are associated with the
outcomes of dialysis patients, but the significance of their variability has not 
been well studied.
METHODS: A total of 384 patients receiving stable hemodialysis treatment during
2002 were followed up for mortality until the end of 2013. The within-patient
coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated for 13 laboratory parameters from 
1 year of data. We defined variability as CV and analyzed the survival of the
patients according to the baseline CV values of each parameter by proportional
hazard modeling.
RESULTS: During the 11-year observation period, 125 patients died. Higher CV
levels for eight parameters, namely, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium,
hemoglobin, creatinine, total protein, albumin, potassium and phosphate, were
significantly associated with all-cause mortality. The adjusted hazard ratios for
a high BUN-CV (>15 %) and a high Na-CV (>1.3 %) against a lower CV were 1.92 (95 
% CI 1.31-2.81) and 1.95 (1.36-2.80), respectively. The increased mortality risk 
associated with each variability was attributed to excess non-cardiac deaths. The
CV values of most parameters were correlated with each other and often exhibited 
negative associations with age, diabetes, and mobility as well as the levels of
hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, Na, the protein catabolic rate, and the
creatinine generation rate. Therefore, a high variability was generally
associated with frailty-related adverse prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The variability of several blood parameters had a significant impact
on all-cause and non-cardiac mortality. The levels of the variabilities were most
likely related to poor physical conditions of the patients.

Several studies have investigated geographical variations in access to renal
transplant waiting lists, but none has assessed the impact on these variations of
factors at both the patient and geographic levels. The objective of our study was
to identify medical and non-medical factors at both these levels associated with 
these geographical variations in waiting-list placement in France. We included
all incident patients aged 18-80 years in 11 French regions who started dialysis 
between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. Both a multilevel Cox model with 
shared frailty and a competing risks model were used for the analyses. At the
patient level, old age, comorbidities, diabetic nephropathy, non-autonomous first
dialysis, and female gender were the major determinants of a lower probability of
being waitlisted. At the regional level, the only factor associated with this
probability was an increase in the number of patients on the waiting list from
2005 to 2009. This finding supports a slight but significant impact of a regional
organ shortage on waitlisting practices. Our findings demonstrate that patients' 
age has a major impact on waitlisting practices, even for patients with no
comorbidity or disability, whose survival would likely be improved by
transplantation compared with dialysis.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frailty is associated with poor outcomes for patients 
on dialysis; however, previous studies have not taken into account the severity
of frailty as a predictor of outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess if
there was an association between the degree of frailty and mortality among
patients on incident dialysis.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A cohort study of incident chronic
dialysis patients was conducted between January of 2009 and June of 2013 (last
follow-up in December of 2013). On the basis of overall clinical impression, the 
Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score was determined for patients at the start of
dialysis by their primary nephrologist. This simple scale allocates a single
point to different states of frailty (1, very fit; 2, well; 3, managing well; 4, 
vulnerable; 5, mildly frail; 6, moderately frail; 7, severely frail or terminally
ill) with an emphasis on function of the assessed individual. The primary outcome
was time to death. Patients were censored at the time of transplantation.
RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 390 patients with completed CFS scores (mean age
of 63±15 years old). Most were Caucasian (89%) and men (67%), and 30% of patients
had ESRD caused by diabetic nephropathy. The median Charlson Comorbidity Index
score was 4 (interquartile range =3-6), and the median CFS score was 4
(interquartile range =2-5). There were 96 deaths over 750 patient-years at risk. 
In an adjusted Cox survival analysis, the hazard ratio associated with each
1-point increase in the CFS was 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.43;
P=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher severity of frailty (as defined by the CFS) at dialysis
initiation is associated with higher mortality.

A chronic disease in older adults usually runs a course that is less predictable 
than in younger individuals. Unexplained variations in disease incidence,
prognosis, therapeutic responses, and toxicity are frequently observed among
older adults. This heterogeneity poses huge challenges to the current
one-size-fits-all health care systems, and calls for more personalized
managements of chronic diseases in older adults. Aging is characterized by
progressive deterioration of bodily functions with increasing risk of failure
over time. The entire process is hierarchically organized, and progresses from
intracellular events to changes at systemic and ultimately organism levels at
different rates among different individuals. Aging biology exerts great
influences on the development and progression of most age-related chronic
diseases. Thus, aging biology could contribute to the complexity of illnesses
that increase with age, and aging biomarkers possess a great potential to enable 
personalized health risk assessment and health care. We review evidences
supporting the roles of aging biomarkers in risk assessment of prevalent
age-related diseases. Frailty phenotype is an objectively measured indicator of
advanced-stage aging that is characterized by organism-level dysfunction. In
contrast, altered inflammation markers level signifies an earlier stage between
cellular abnormalities and systems dysfunction. Results of human observational
studies and randomized controlled trials indicate that these measures, albeit
simple, greatly facilitate classification of older patients with cancer, chronic 
kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes mellitus into groups 
that vary in disease incidence, prognosis and therapeutic response/toxicity. As
the detailed mechanisms underlying the complex biologic process of aging are
unraveled in the future, a larger array of biomarkers that correlate with
biologic aging at different stages will be discovered. Following the
translational research framework described in this article, these research
efforts would result in innovations in disease prevention and management that
address the huge unmet health needs of aging populations.

The geriatric population presents a unique set of challenges in urologic
oncology. In addition to the known natural history of disease, providers must
also consider patient factors such as functional and nutritional status,
comorbidities and social support when determining the treatment plan. The
development of frailty measures and biomarkers to estimate surgical risk shows
promise, with several assessment tools predictive of surgical complications.
Decreased dependence on chronologic age is important when assessing surgical
fitness, as age cutoffs prevent appropriate treatment of many elderly patients
who would benefit from surgery. Within bladder, kidney and prostate cancers,
continued refinement of surgical techniques offers a broader array of options for
the geriatric patient than previously available.

Many observers have noted that the morphological changes that occur in chronic
kidney disease (CKD) patients resemble those seen in the geriatric population,
with strikingly similar morbidity and mortality profiles and rates of frailty in 
the two groups, and shared characteristics at a pathophysiological level
especially in respect to the changes seen in their vascular and immune systems.
However, whilst much has been documented about the shared physical
characteristics of aging and uremia, the molecular and cellular similarities
between the two have received less attention. In order to bridge this perceived
gap we have reviewed published research concerning the common molecular processes
seen in aging subjects and CKD patients, with specific attention to altered
proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, post-translational protein modification,
and senescence and telomere attrition. We have also sought to illustrate how the 
cell death and survival pathways apoptosis, necroptosis and autophagy are closely
interrelated, and how an understanding of these overlapping pathways is helpful
in order to appreciate the shared molecular basis behind the pathophysiology of
aging and uremia. This analysis revealed many common molecular characteristics
and showed similar patterns of cellular dysfunction. We conclude that the
accelerated aging seen in patients with CKD is underpinned at the molecular
level, and that a greater understanding of these molecular processes might
eventually lead to new much needed therapeutic strategies of benefit to patients 
with renal disease.

Nephroprevention in the oldest old with chronic kidney disease: Special
considerations.

Nephroprevention strategies are crucial for handling chronic kidney disease (CKD)
complications, and slowing its progression. However, these preventative measures 
should be guided by major geriatrics principles in order to help nephrologists to
adequately handle the oldest old with CKD. These geriatric concepts consist of
taking into account the relevance of choosing an individualized therapy, handling
clinical frailty, and keeping a geriatric perspective which means that a good
quality of life is sometimes a more important therapeutic objective in
octogenarians than merely prolonging life. Even though nephroprevention
strategies for treating the oldest old with CKD are basically similar to those
applied to younger patients such as low sodium and protein diet, optimized
hemoglobin levels, blood pressure and metabolic control, the treating physician
or care provider must at all times be ready to make fundamental adjustments and
tweak patient care paradigms and objectives if and when the initial therapeutic
options applied have caused unintended clinical consequences and complications.
Additionally, the sarcopenia status should also be evaluated and treated in very 
old CKD patients.

Frailty, which is a geriatric syndrome characterized by weakness, impaired
mobility, balance, and minimal reserve, is highly prevalent in the renal
population. While distinct from disability and comorbidity, some of the simplest 
and most clinically useful scales incorporate both the burden of medical symptoms
and the effect on functional independence into the evaluation of frailty. In the 
renal population, the frailty phenotype has been shown to correlate with
important outcomes such as hospitalization and survival. Further work is required
to establish if the presence of, and the treatments used for renal disease,
promote the sick role and decreased participation in exercise with overestimation
of frailty or if the frailty phenotype identifies people who may benefit from
rehabilitation and other interventions.

BACKGROUND: Environmental lead and cadmium exposure is associated with higher
risk of several age-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease,
chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis. These diseases may lead to frailty, a
geriatric syndrome characterized by diminished physiologic reserve in multiple
systems with decreased ability to cope with acute stressors. However, no previous
study has evaluated the association between lead or cadmium exposure and frailty.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study among individuals aged ≥ 60 years who participated
in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and had either
blood lead (N=5272) or urine cadmium (N=4887) determinations. Frailty was
ascertained with a slight modification of the Fried criteria, so that individuals
meeting ≥ 3 of 5 pre-defined criteria (exhaustion, low body weight, low physical 
activity, weakness and slow walking speed), were considered as frail. The
association between lead and cadmium with frailty was evaluated using logistic
regression with adjustment for relevant confounders.
RESULTS: Median (intertertile range) concentrations of blood lead and urine
cadmium were 3.9 µg/dl (2.9-4.9) and 0.62 µg/l (0.41-0.91), respectively. The
prevalence of frailty was 7.1%. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence
interval) of frailty comparing the second and third to the lowest tertile of
blood lead were, respectively, 1.40 (0.96-2.04) and 1.75 (1.33-2.31). Lead
concentrations were also associated with the frequency of exhaustion, weakness
and slowness. The corresponding odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for cadmium
were, respectively, 0.97 (0.68-1.39) and 1.55 (1.03-2.32), but this association
did not hold after excluding participants with reduced glomerular filtration
rate: 0.70 (0.43-1.14) and 1.09 (0.56-2.11), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the US older adult population, blood lead but not urine cadmium
concentrations showed a direct dose-response relationship with frailty. These
findings support that lead exposure increases frailty in older adults.

AIM: Despite the perceived importance of frailty, few studies focus on its impact
on rural patients undergoing chronic dialysis. Comparison of different
self-report questionnaires in assessing frailty among these patients has not been
attempted before.
METHODS: A prospectively enrolled chronic dialysis cohort from a rural centre was
recruited for analysis. Six types of self-report questionnaires were administered
to these patients. Clinical and dialysis-related laboratory parameters were
collected. Correlation analyses between questionnaire results and dialysis
complications were performed, and variables demonstrating significant
correlations were entered into multivariate regression models to determine their 
independent associations.
RESULTS: Six types of questionnaire (Strawbridge questionnaire, Edmonton Frail
Scale, simple FRAIL scale, Groningen Frail Indicator, G8 questionnaire, and
Tilburg Frail Indicator) were provided to rural patients undergoing chronic
dialysis. Scores from each questionnaire showed significant association with each
other, except the G8 questionnaire. Scores from the simple FRAIL scale correlated
significantly with age (P = 0.02), female gender (P = 0.03), higher Liu's
comorbidity index (P = 0.02), lower serum albumin (P = 0.03) and creatinine
levels (P < 0.01), and higher ferritin levels (P = 0.02). The other five
questionnaires did not show consistently significant relationships with important
dialysis-related complications. Multivariate linear regression analysis
identified an independently negative association between serum albumin and the
simple FRAIL scale results (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This is the first study establishing the utility of different
self-report questionnaires for assessing frailty in chronic dialysis patients.
The simple FRAIL scale scores might demonstrate a closer relationship with
dialysis-related complications.

Multi-MitraClip therapy for severe degenerative mitral regurgitation: "anchor"
technique for extremely flail segments.

In high-risk or inoperable patients, implantation of MitraClip for treatment of
severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation (MR) from central (A2/P2 pathology,
EVEREST patient) is effective in reducing symptoms and improving functional
class. Extending the use of MitraClip to the non-EVEREST patient is of
considerable interest. MitraClip implantation for wide flail segments and
non-central MR is technically more challenging but represents an important and
highly prevalent subset of patients. We present a case of an 82-year-old male
referred to our institution for medically refractory primary MR. Trans-esophageal
echocardiogram demonstrated severe (4+) MR, annular dilatation, P3 > P2 mitral
valve prolapse, malcoaptation, and wide flail gaps and widths. The patient's age,
frailty, chronic kidney disease, and mild cognitive impairment rendered him a
candidate for MitraClip therapy. Our target area, the areas of maximum flail
(A3/P3), proved too wide for grasping. Hence, the first clip was deployed medial 
to the target area. Subsequent deployment, in a sequential fashion ("zipper
technique"), was not technically feasible due to persistent instability of the
target area. Consideration was given to an alternative approach by "anchoring"
our target area where the 2nd and 3rd clips were deployed lateral to the A3/P3
segment in efforts to "anchor" the maximum flail segment. This maneuver allowed
final clip deployment into a more stable target area. Subsequent imaging
demonstrated reduction in MR from 4+ to 1+ with preservation of a normal
transmitral gradient. We report the first successful US case of four MitraClip
implantation for the treatment of severe primary MR by "anchoring" flail
segments.

The overall number of very elderly patients (>79 years of age) requiring renal
replacement therapy is rising in the Western societies, with a choice for
managing advanced chronic renal disease among hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, 
kidney transplant, conservative, or palliative care. The selection of the most
adequate alternatives should be tailored to meet individual needs, considering
variables such as patient's choice, clinical status, and social context, analyzed
from a geriatric perspective, aiming not only to prolong patient's life
expectancy, but also to improve the patient's quality of life. Frailty and
sarcopenia are highly prevalent comorbidities found in very elderly population,
particularly in the end-stage chronic renal disease population. Both
comorbidities have a strong negative impact on health general status, and
specific treatment should be provided in conjunction with the selected management
for renal replacement, except when a palliative care has been implemented.
Moreover, the detected degree of frailty in a renal patient can have an important
influence on the decision about which modality of renal replacement treatment
will be selected. All these alternatives and considerations are discussed in the 
present review article.

The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is rising, particularly
among the elderly population. Defining aging as successful or unsuccessful has
become clinically relevant in the last 15 years, with an increased recognition of
the frail phenotype. Frailty has been shown to be associated with CKD and poorer 
outcomes, such as death or dialysis. It is likely that the mechanisms of disease 
in CKD such as altered protein metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and
anemia accelerate normal aging and lead to worsening frailty in elderly patients 
with CKD.

BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) side effects often prompt dose reduction 
or discontinuation, and this MMF dose reduction (MDR) can lead to rejection and
possibly graft loss. Unfortunately, little is known about what factors might
cause or contribute to MDR. Frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve, is
emerging as an important, novel domain of risk in kidney transplantation
recipients. We hypothesized that frailty, an inflammatory phenotype, might be
associated with MDR.
METHODS: We measured frailty (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical
activity, and slowed walking speed), other patient and donor characteristics,
longitudinal MMF doses, and graft loss in 525 kidney transplantation recipients. 
Time-to-MDR was quantified using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: By 2 years after transplantation, 54% of frail recipients and 45% of
nonfrail recipients experienced MDR; by 4 years, incidence was 67% and 51%. Frail
recipients were 1.29 times (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.66; P =
0.04) more likely to experience MDR, as were deceased donor recipients (adjusted 
hazard ratio [aHR], 1.92; 95% CI, 1.44-2.54, P < 0.001) and older adults (age ≥
65 vs <65; aHR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-1.96, P = 0.01). Mycophenolate mofetil dose
reduction was independently associated with a substantially increased risk of
death-censored graft loss (aHR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.97-13.98, P = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A better understanding of risk factors for MMF intolerance might help
in planning alternate strategies to maintain adequate immunosuppression and
prolong allograft survival.

In patients older than 75 years with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the
decision between treatment with dialysis [intention to treat with dialysis (ITD)]
or conservative care (CC) is a challenge. Geriatric assessment can be helpful.
The aim was to identify which factors had had an influence on
decision-making.METHODS: We recruited 56 patients. At baseline we analyzed age,
frailty (defined following the criteria of Fried et al. [J Gerontol A Biol Sci
Med Sci 2001;56:146-156]), dependence for activities of daily living (ADL),
cognitive impairment, depression, comorbidity, cardiovascular disease, and
diabetes. After full information about prognosis and treatment options, the
preferences of the patients and families were taken into consideration as
determinants in the decision-making process. During the follow-up, we evaluated
clinical and laboratory parameters, hospitalization, mortality and reevaluated
frailty.
RESULTS: Twenty patients opted for CC, and 36 patients opted for ITD. On
univariate analysis, the predictive factors of the election of CC were age,
prefrailty, cognitive impairment, and dependence for ADL. In the multivariate
analysis, age and prefrailty remained as predictors for the choice of CC.
Hospitalizations were more frequent in CC. Survival was similar in both groups (p
= 0.098).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty assessment could be useful for decision-making about the
treatment in elderly patients with CKD. CC may be a good treatment option.

Diagnosis and Treatment of Low Testosterone among Patients with End-Stage Renal
Disease.

Bao Y(1), Johansen KL.

Author information: 
(1)John Muir Medical Group, Walnut Creek, California.

The prevalence of low testosterone level is particularly high among patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and has been associated with mortality. In
populations without ESRD, low testosterone level has also been associated with a 
number of morbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, low
muscle mass, low bone mass, low physical performance, and frailty. However, there
is controversy regarding what constitutes low testosterone level in the aging
population and at what level replacement therapy with testosterone is indicated. 
There are no randomized controlled trials investigating long-term outcomes of
testosterone replacement therapy in populations with or without ESRD. Available
trial results suggest equivocal improvements in sexual function. Muscle mass and 
bone mineral density appear to improve, but results in physical function and
performance are mixed and there are no data on fracture prevention. Some recent
data suggest harm when testosterone was given to men with limited mobility.
Finally, there is little evidence that testosterone adds to existing
erythropoietin agents in the treatment of anemia in ESRD. Due to lack of evidence
supporting long-term use of testosterone, the authors recommend against the
routine use of testosterone in ESRD patients with low testosterone levels.
Testosterone treatment can be considered in those with low bone mass and total
testosterone level <200 ng/dl, or in younger patients with sexual complaints with
total testosterone level lower than the reference range. It is important to
engage patients in discussion of risks and benefits before initiating
testosterone therapy; testosterone therapy should be discontinued if the intended
treatment effect is not observed after short-term use.

Decisions and discussions about the initiation of dialysis in the elderly are
often challenging because of the high prevalence of comorbidities and frailty in 
this population. Mortality is high, functional decline is likely, and quality of 
life tends to be lower in the elderly on dialysis. It is thus important to
counsel these patients on the risks, benefits, and burdens of dialysis to assist 
them in making an informed choice that is in line with their goals, preferences, 
and expectations. For some patients, dialysis may be a desirable choice. For
others, the alternative of palliative care may provide a more favorable balance
of benefits versus burdens. Elderly patients who choose to proceed with dialysis 
often benefit from an interdisciplinary team that helps to manage and monitor
their health status, while maximizing the benefits of treatment and decreasing
its potential harms. These goals can be promoted by effective communication and
through individualized decisions about vascular access, medication choices, and
dietary limitations. Finally, close monitoring of functional status will help to 
determine whether dialysis remains in a patient's best interest and when
alternatives should be offered.

We have previously described strong associations between frailty, a measure of
physiologic reserve initially described and validated in geriatrics, and early
hospital readmission as well as delayed graft function. The goal of this study
was to estimate its association with postkidney transplantation (post-KT)
mortality. Frailty was prospectively measured in 537 KT recipients at the time of
transplantation between November 2008 and August 2013. Cox proportional hazards
models were adjusted for confounders using a novel approach to substantially
improve model efficiency and generalizability in single-center studies. We
precisely estimated the confounder coefficients using the large sample size of
the Scientific Registry of Transplantation Recipients (n = 37 858) and introduced
these into the single-center model, which then estimated the adjusted frailty
coefficient. At 5 years, the survivals were 91.5%, 86.0% and 77.5% for nonfrail, 
intermediately frail and frail KT recipients, respectively. Frailty was
independently associated with a 2.17-fold (95% CI: 1.01-4.65, p = 0.047) higher
risk of death. In conclusion, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent
risk factor for post-KT mortality, even after carefully adjusting for many
confounders using a novel, efficient statistical approach.

Renal functional reserve and renal recovery after acute kidney injury.

Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.

Renal functional reserve (RFR) represents the capacity of the kidney to increase 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to certain physiological or
pathological stimuli or conditions. Once baseline GFR is determined, RFR can be
assessed clinically after an oral protein load or intravenous amino acid
infusion. In clinical practice, baseline GFR displays variable levels due to diet
or other factors. RFR is the difference between peak 'stress' GFR induced by the 
test (p.o. or i.v.) and the baseline GFR. In clinical scenarios where
hyperfiltration is present (high baseline GFR due to pregnancy, hypertension or
diabetic nephropathy, in solitary kidney or kidney donors), RFR may be fully or
partially used to achieve normal or supranormal renal function. Since commonly
used renal function markers, such as GFR, may remain within normal ranges until
50% of nephrons are lost or in patients with a single remnant kidney, the RFR
test may represent a sensitive and early way to assess the functional decline in 
the kidney. RFR assessment may become an important tool to evaluate the ability
of the kidney to recover completely or partially after a kidney attack. In case
of healing with a defect and progressive fibrosis, recovery may appear complete
clinically, but a reduced RFR may be a sign of a maladaptive repair or
subclinical loss of renal mass. Thus, a reduction in RFR may represent the
equivalent of renal frailty or susceptibility to insults. The main aim of this
article is to review the concept of RFR, its utility in different clinical
scenarios, and future perspective for its use.

Chronic Kidney Disease in Adults in Primary and Secondary Care.

The Renal National Service Framework (NSF), and the subsequent NICE Clinical
Practice Guideline for early identification and management of adults with chronic
kidney disease (CKD) in primary and secondary care (CG73), served to emphasise
the change in focus in renal medicine from treatment of established kidney
disease to earlier identification and prevention of kidney disease. CKD describes
abnormal kidney function and/or structure. It is common, frequently unrecognised 
and often coexists with other conditions (for example, cardiovascular disease and
diabetes). Moderate to severe CKD also carries an increased risk of other
significant adverse outcomes such acute kidney injury, falls, frailty and
mortality. The risk of developing CKD increases with increasing age, and some
conditions that coexist with CKD become more severe and increasingly prevalent as
kidney dysfunction advances. CKD can progress to end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD)in a small but significant percentage of people. CKD is usually
asymptomatic but it is detectable, and tests for detecting CKD are both simple
and freely available. There is evidence that treatment can prevent or delay the
progression of CKD, reduce or prevent the development of complications and reduce
the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, because of a lack of specific
symptoms, CKD frequently remains undetected and unrecognised. As a consequence
people with CKD are often not diagnosed, or diagnosed late when CKD is at an
advanced stage. Late diagnosis is associated with increased morbidity, mortality 
and healthcare associated costs.

This paper presents an extension of the joint modeling strategy for the case of
multiple longitudinal outcomes and repeated infections of different types over
time, motivated by postkidney transplantation data. Our model comprises two parts
linked by shared latent terms. On the one hand is a multivariate mixed linear
model with random effects, where a low-rank thin-plate spline function is
incorporated to collect the nonlinear behavior of the different profiles over
time. On the other hand is an infection-specific Cox model, where the dependence 
between different types of infections and the related times of infection is
through a random effect associated with each infection type to catch the within
dependence and a shared frailty parameter to capture the dependence between
infection types. We implemented the parameterization used in joint models which
uses the fitted longitudinal measurements as time-dependent covariates in a
relative risk model. Our proposed model was implemented in OpenBUGS using the
MCMC approach.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with chronic kidney disease stage 5 may be offered a
choice between dialysis and conservative management. Few studies have explored
patients' reasons for choosing conservative management and none have compared the
views of those who have chosen different treatments across renal units.
STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative study with semistructured interviews.
SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: Patients 75 years or older recruited from 9 renal units.
Units were chosen to reflect variation in the scale of delivery of conservative
management.
METHODOLOGY: Semistructured interviews audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: 42 interviews were completed, 4 to 6 per renal unit. Patients were
sampled from those receiving dialysis, those preparing for dialysis, and those
choosing conservative management. 14 patients in each group were interviewed.
Patients who had chosen different treatments held varying beliefs about what
dialysis could offer. The information that patients reported receiving from
clinical staff differed between units. Patients from units with a more
established conservative management pathway were more aware of conservative
management, less often believed that dialysis would guarantee longevity, and more
often had discussed the future with staff. Some patients receiving conservative
management reported that they would have dialysis if they became unwell in the
future, indicating the conditional nature of their decision.
LIMITATIONS: Recruitment of older adults with frailty and comorbid conditions was
difficult and therefore transferability of findings to this population is
limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with chronic kidney disease stage 5 who have chosen
different treatment options have contrasting beliefs about the likely outcomes of
dialysis for those who are influenced by information provided by renal units.
Supporting renal staff in discussing conservative management as a valid
alternative to dialysis for a subset of patients will aid informed decision
making. There is a need for better evidence about conservative management to
support shared decision making for older people with chronic kidney failure.

Several studies have reported underprescription of anticoagulants in atrial
fibrillation (AF). We conducted an observational study on 142 out of a total of
995 consecutive ≥75 years old patients presenting AF (14%) when admitted in an
emergency unit of a general hospital, in search of geriatric characteristics that
might be associated with the underprescription of anticoagulation therapy (mostly
antivitamin K at the time of the study). The following data was collected from
patients presenting AF: medical history including treatment and comorbidities,
CHADS2 score, ISAR scale (frailty), Lawton's scale (ADL), GDS scale (mood
status), MUST (nutrition), and blood analysis (INR, kidney function, and
albumin). Among those patients for who anticoagulation treatment was recommended 
(73%), only 61% were treated with it. In the group with anticoagulation therapy, 
the following characteristics were observed more often than in the group without 
such therapy: a recent (≤6 months) hospitalization and medical treatment
including digoxin or based on >3 different drugs. Neither the value of the CHADS2
score, nor the geriatric characteristics could be correlated with the presence or
the absence of an anticoagulation therapy. More research is thus required to
identify and clarify the relative importance of patient-, physician-, and health 
care system-related hurdles for the prescription of oral anticoagulation therapy 
in older patients with AF.

Aging is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory status that contributes
to chronic diseases such as age-related muscle wasting, kidney disease, and
diabetes mellitus. Since advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are known to be
proinflammatory, this systematic review examined the relation between the dietary
intake of AGEs and inflammatory processes. The PubMed and Web of Science
databases were screened systematically. Seventeen relevant studies in humans or
animals were included. The intervention studies in humans showed mainly a
decrease in inflammation in subjects on a low-AGE diet, while an increase in
inflammation in subjects on a high-AGE diet was less apparent. About half of the 
observational studies found a relationship between inflammatory processes and
AGEs in food. When the results are considered together, the dietary intake of
AGEs appears to be related to inflammatory status and the level of circulating
AGEs. Moreover, limiting AGE intake may lead to a decrease in inflammation and
chronic diseases related to inflammatory status. Most of the trials were
conducted in patients with chronic kidney disease or diabetes, and thus
additional studies in healthy individuals are needed. Further investigation is
needed to elucidate the effects of lifetime exposure of dietary AGEs on aging and
health.

Today, old age does not represent a formal contraindication to kidney
transplantation. Rather, there is evidence that in elderly patients renal
transplantation offers longer life expectancy and better quality of life in
comparison with dialysis. Yet, the results of renal transplantation in recipients
older than 65years are inferior to those observed in younger adults, death with
functioning graft representing a major cause of failure. Therefore, the selection
of aged patients is of paramount importance. Apart from the routine clinical and 
biological investigations, three aspects have been relatively neglected by the
transplant community and may require a careful analysis in elderly candidates to 
transplantation: the presence and degree of frailty, the presence of
comorbidities and the adherence to prescriptions. Although there are rapid and
simple tests for assessing the degree of frailty in the elderly, there is no
clear cut-off value to decide whether a patient should be accepted or not. With
advanced age the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular events and other
diseases tend to increase. The use of combined age-comorbidity indices may be
helpful to identify patients at high risk of mortality. Another critical point is
the poor unintentional adherence to treatment, often caused by forgetfulness and 
mild cognitive impairment. These drawbacks may be further enhanced by a high
number of pills to take and by changes in the dosage or type of prescriptions. A 
careful screening of the presence and degree of frailty, comorbidity and poor
compliance to treatment is highly recommended before admitting older candidates
to the waiting list for transplantation.

Impact of frailty on short- and long-term morbidity and mortality after
transcatheter aortic valve implantation: risk assessment by Katz Index of

AIMS: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) represents a less invasive
treatment option for elderly patients. Therefore, we aimed to determine the
impact of frailty measured by the Katz Index of activities of daily living (ADL) 
on short- and long-term mortality after TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Our study included 300 consecutive patients (mean age, 82±5 
years) who had undergone TAVI at our institution (158 transapical, 142
transfemoral procedures). At baseline, 144 patients were impaired in at least one
ADL and therefore defined as frail (Katz Index <6). Regarding in-hospital
outcome, all serious complications except for stage 3 acute kidney injury were
equally distributed in both groups, but early mortality was significantly higher 
in frail persons (5.5% vs. 1.3%, p=0.04 for immediate procedural mortality; 17%
vs. 5.8%, p=0.002 for 30-day mortality; and 23% vs. 6.4%, p<0.0001 for procedural
mortality). The risk-score-based 30-day mortality estimates (29% vs. 24% for log.
EuroSCORE I, 9.5% vs. 7.5% for EuroSCORE II, and 8.8% vs. 5.9% for STS score)
reflected neither the observed 30-day mortality in both groups nor the threefold 
risk elevation in frail patients. In contrast, the Katz Index <6 was identified
as a significant independent predictor of long-term all-cause mortality by
multivariate analysis (HR 2.67 [95% CI: 1.7-4.3], p<0.0001). During follow-up
(median observation period 537 days) 56% of frail vs. 24% of non-frail patients
died.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty status measured by the Katz Index represents a powerful
predictor of adverse early and late outcome after TAVI, whereas commonly used
risk scores lack calibration and discrimination in a TAVI-specific patient
cohort. Therefore, we propose the incorporation of this simple and reproducible
measure into pre-TAVI risk assessment.

Frailty, disability and physical exercise in the aging process and in chronic

Frailty in the elderly is a state of vulnerability to poor resolution of
homoeostasis after a stressor event and is a consequence of cumulative decline in
many physiological systems during a lifetime. This cumulative decline depletes
homoeostatic reserves until minor stressor events trigger disproportionate
changes in health status. It is usually associated to adverse health outcomes and
to one-year mortality risk. Physical exercise has found to be effective in
preventing frailty and disability in this population. Chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is also a clinical condition where protein energy-wasting, sarcopenia and
dynapenia ,very common symptoms in the frail elderly, may occur. Moreover elderly
and CKD patients are both affected by an impaired physical performance that may
be reversed by physical exercise with an improvement of the survival rate. These 
similarities suggest that frailty may be a common pathway of aging and CKD that
may induce disability and that can be prevented by a multidimensional approach in
which physical exercise plays an important role.

Linagliptin use in older individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Older people have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) of
any age group and are thus frequent users of glucose-lowering agents. Because
individuals 65 years or older are underrepresented in clinical studies, there is 
a lack of information regarding the efficacy and safety of available treatments
in this population. Additionally, a high prevalence of comorbidities,
polypharmacy, and frailty can make treatment of T2DM in this population
challenging. Safety is an important consideration when choosing a treatment for
older individuals. Renal impairment is quite common in older patients with T2DM
and can contribute to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can lead to serious
consequences, such as falls and fractures, and cognitive changes. As such,
hemoglobin A₁c treatment targets, typically <7% in the general population, are
less stringent in older people, with the goal being an individualized target that
balances efficacy and safety. Many glucose-lowering agents can cause adverse
events detrimental to older individuals, such as hypoglycemia (insulin,
sulfonylureas), weight gain (sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones), gastrointestinal
events (metformin), and fractures (thiazolidinediones), and are contraindicated
or require dose adjustments in those with renal impairment (most oral/injectable 
agents). Orally administered dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors have a low
risk of hypoglycemia and are generally well tolerated. Linagliptin is the only
DPP-4 inhibitor excreted through nonrenal pathways and therefore does not require
any dose adjustment in older patients with kidney disease. This paper reviews the
findings of a recent study by Barnett et al assessing the efficacy and safety of 
the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin in patients with T2DM aged 70 years or older,
which concluded that linagliptin may be a useful glucose-lowering option for
older patients with T2DM.

[How to manage chronic kidney disease in the elderly?].

[Article in French]

Krzesinski JM, Delanaye P.

From age 30 onwards, kidney function physiologically decreases although this
deterioration cannot yet be called chronic kidney disease. The latter appears in 
those exposed to cardiovascular risk factors associated with inflammation and
oxidative stress. A diffuse atherosclerosis then develops Patients with a
decreased glomerular filtration rate, especially below the threshold of 45
ml/min, are characterised by a poor physical heath and by cognitive disorders,
leading to frailty. In these conditions, a management strategy to reduce the
increased risk of acute kidney injury should be outlined and the need for renal
replacement therapy be considered. One must try to maintain the best possible

The most commonly recognized complications in cirrhotic patients include ascites,
hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, susceptibility for infections, kidney 
dysfunction, and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, severe muscle wasting or
sarcopenia are the most common and frequently unseen complications which
negatively impact survival, quality of life, and response to stressor, such as
infections and surgeries. At present, D'Amico stage classification, Child-Pugh,
and MELD scores constitute the best tools to predict mortality in patients with
cirrhosis; however, one of their main limitations is the lack of assessing the
nutritional and functional status. Currently, numerous methods are available to
evaluate the nutrition status of the cirrhotic patient; nevertheless, most of
these techniques have limitations primarily because lack of objectivity,
reproducibility, and prognosis discrimination. In this regard, an objective and
reproducible technique, such as muscle mass quantification with cross-sectional
imaging studies (computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging)
constitute an attractive index of nutritional status in cirrhosis. Sarcopenia is 
part of the frailty complex present in cirrhotic patients, resulting from
cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and characterized by
impaired functional capacity, decreased reserve, resistance to stressors, and
predisposition to poor outcomes. In this review, we discuss the current accepted 
and new methods to evaluate prognosis in cirrhosis. Also, we analyze the current 
knowledge regarding incidence and clinical impact of malnutrition and sarcopenia 
in patients with cirrhosis and their impact after liver transplantation. Finally,
we discuss existing and potential novel therapeutic approaches for malnutrition
in cirrhosis, emphasizing the recognition of sarcopenia in an effort to reduced
morbidity related and improved survival in cirrhosis.

Hemodialysis (HD) is routinely offered to patients with end-stage renal disease
in the United States who are ineligible for other renal replacement modalities.
The frequency of HD among the US population is greater than all other countries, 
except Taiwan and Japan. In US, patients are often dialyzed irrespective of age, 
comorbidities, prognosis, or decision-making capacity. Determination of when
patients can no longer dialyze is variable and can be dialysis-center specific.
Determinants may be related to progressive comorbidities and frailty, mobility or
access issues, patient self-determination, or an inability to tolerate the
treatment safely for any number of reasons (e.g., hypotension, behavioral
issues). Behavioral issues may impact the safety of not only patients themselves,
but also those around them. In this article the authors present the case of an
elderly patient on HD with progressive cognitive impairment and combative
behavior placing him and others at risk of physical harm. The authors discuss the
medical, ethical, legal, and psychosocial challenges to care of such patients who
lack decision-making capacity with a focus on variable approaches by regions and 
culture. This manuscript provides recommendations and highlights resources to
assist nephrologists, dialysis personnel, ethics consultants, and palliative
medicine teams in managing such patients to resolve conflict.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors can minimize the hypoglycaemic burden and
enhance safety in elderly people with diabetes.

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among elderly people is
increasing. Often associated with disabilities/comorbidities, T2DM lowers the
chances of successful aging and is independently associated with frailty and an
increased risk of hypoglycaemia, which can be further exacerbated by
antihyperglycaemic treatment. From this perspective, the clinical management of
T2DM in the elderly is challenging and requires individualization of optimum
glycaemic targets depending on comorbidities, cognitive functioning and ability
to recognize and self-manage the disease. The lack of solid evidence-based
medicine supporting treatment guidelines for older people with diabetes further
complicates the matter. Several classes of medicine for the treatment of T2DM are
currently available and different drug combinations are often required to achieve
individualized glycaemic goals. Many of these drugs, however, carry disadvantages
such as the propensity to cause weight gain or hypoglycaemia. Dipeptidyl
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, a recent addition to the pharmacological
armamentarium, have become widely accepted in clinical practice because of their 
efficacy, low risk of hypoglycaemia, neutral effect on body weight, and
apparently greater safety in patients with kidney failure. Although more
information is needed to reach definitive conclusions, growing evidence suggests 
that DPP-4 inhibitors may become a valuable component in the pharmacological
management of elderly people with T2DM. The present review aims to delineate the 
potential advantages of this pharmacological approach in the treatment of elderly
people with T2DM.

An approach to addressing selection bias in survival analysis.

Carlin CS(1), Solid CA.

Author information:

This work proposes a frailty model that accounts for non-random treatment
assignment in survival analysis. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we found that
estimated treatment parameters from our proposed endogenous selection survival
model (esSurv) closely parallel the consistent two-stage residual inclusion
(2SRI) results, while offering computational and interpretive advantages. The
esSurv method greatly enhances computational speed relative to 2SRI by
eliminating the need for bootstrapped standard errors and generally results in
smaller standard errors than those estimated by 2SRI. In addition, esSurv
explicitly estimates the correlation of unobservable factors contributing to both
treatment assignment and the outcome of interest, providing an interpretive
advantage over the residual parameter estimate in the 2SRI method. Comparisons
with commonly used propensity score methods and with a model that does not
account for non-random treatment assignment show clear bias in these methods,
which is not mitigated by increased sample size. We illustrate using actual
dialysis patient data comparing mortality of patients with mature arteriovenous
grafts for venous access to mortality of patients with grafts placed but not yet 
ready for use at the initiation of dialysis. We find strong evidence of
endogeneity (with estimate of correlation in unobserved factors ρ^=0.55) and
estimate a mature-graft hazard ratio of 0.197 in our proposed method, with a
similar 0.173 hazard ratio using 2SRI. The 0.630 hazard ratio from a frailty
model without a correction for the non-random nature of treatment assignment
illustrates the importance of accounting for endogeneity.

BACKGROUND: A well-accepted definition of frailty includes measurements of
physical performance, which may limit its clinical utility.
STUDY DESIGN: In a cross-sectional study, we compared prevalence and patient
characteristics based on a frailty definition that uses self-reported function to
the classic performance-based definition and developed a modified
self-report-based definition.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prevalent adult patients receiving hemodialysis in 14
centers around San Francisco and Atlanta in 2009-2011.
INDEX TESTS: Self-report-based frailty definition in which a score lower than 75 
on the Physical Function scale of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)
was substituted for gait speed and grip strength in the classic definition;
modified self-report definition with optimized Physical Function score cutoff
points derived in a development (one-half) cohort and validated in the other
half.
REFERENCE TEST: Performance-based frailty defined as 3 of the following: weight
loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed.
RESULTS: 387 (53%) patients were frail based on self-reported function, of whom
209 (29% of the cohort) met the performance-based definition. Only 23 (3%) met
the performance-based definition of frailty only. The self-report definition had 
90% sensitivity, 64% specificity, 54% positive predictive value, 93% negative
predictive value, and 72.5% overall accuracy. Intracellular water per kilogram of
body weight and serum albumin, prealbumin, and creatinine levels were highest
among nonfrail individuals, intermediate among those who were frail by
self-report, and lowest among those who also were frail by performance. Age,
percentage of body fat, and C-reactive protein level followed an opposite
pattern. The modified self-report definition had better accuracy (84%; 95% CI,
79%-89%) and superior specificity (88%) and positive predictive value (67%).
LIMITATIONS: Our study did not address prediction of outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the self-report-based but not the
performance-based definition of frailty may represent an intermediate phenotype. 
A modified self-report definition can improve the accuracy of a
questionnaire-based method of defining frailty.

Multilevel mixed effects survival models are used in the analysis of clustered
survival data, such as repeated events, multicenter clinical trials, and
individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses, to investigate heterogeneity in 
baseline risk and covariate effects. In this paper, we extend parametric frailty 
models including the exponential, Weibull and Gompertz proportional hazards (PH) 
models and the log logistic, log normal, and generalized gamma accelerated
failure time models to allow any number of normally distributed random effects.
Furthermore, we extend the flexible parametric survival model of Royston and
Parmar, modeled on the log-cumulative hazard scale using restricted cubic
splines, to include random effects while also allowing for non-PH (time-dependent
effects). Maximum likelihood is used to estimate the models utilizing adaptive or
nonadaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The methods are evaluated through
simulation studies representing clinically plausible scenarios of a multicenter
trial and IPD meta-analysis, showing good performance of the estimation method.
The flexible parametric mixed effects model is illustrated using a dataset of
patients with kidney disease and repeated times to infection and an IPD
meta-analysis of prognostic factor studies in patients with breast cancer.
User-friendly Stata software is provided to implement the methods.

BACKGROUND: Although individuals with kidney disease, including those dependent
on dialysis, often present clinically with signs and symptoms consistent with
frailty, there is limited information about sociodemographic and clinical risk
factors that may be associated.
METHODS: Seven hundred forty-five patients undergoing hemodialysisbetween 2009
and 2011 in 7 Atlanta dialysis clinics and 7 San Francisco bay area dialysis
clinics were assessed using the validated Fried frailty index (recent
unintentional weight loss, reported exhaustion, low grip strength, slow walk
speed, low physical activity) that defines frailty as the presence of 3 or more
criteria. Study coordinators interviewed participants; measured grip strength,
walk speed, and body composition; and reviewed records for clinical and
laboratory parameters. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the
association of patient characteristics with frailty.
RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, peripheral vascular disease and cardiac diseases, 
including dysrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, pericarditis, and
cardiac arrest, were associated with higher odds for frailty, whereas black race 
and higher serum albumin concentration were associated with lower odds for
frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: In multivariable analyses, the risk for frailty in patients
undergoing hemodialysis, as assessed by the presence of 3 or more criteria that
comprise the Fried frailty index, was increased in association with peripheral
vascular disease and cardiac conditions, such as dysrhythmia and atrial
fibrillation, and was decreased for those with higher serum albumin concentration
and for blacks compared with whites. Among patients who met the Fried definition 
of frailty, 78% scored as frail on walk speed and 56% scored as frail on grip
strength, the 2 physical performance measures.

The equations for estimating kidney function have become very popular in the last
decade. However, the clinical and prognostic meaning of these measures may be
very different in older populations. Two cohorts of people aged 65-89 years
(older sample) and 90 or more (oldest old sample) were used to investigate the
prognostic significance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
Additionally, we also investigated whether combining frailty and eGFR may improve
the accuracy of frailty in predicting mortality. We found that lower eGFR values 
were significantly more frequent among frail subjects in both groups. eGFR < 30
was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality either in subjects
aged 65-89 years (HR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.23-11.2) or in those aged 90 or more
(HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.05-2.23). In the latter group, a not significant trend for
increasing mortality was also observed among people with eGFR > 60 (HR = 1.28,
95% CI = 0.72-2.26). In addition, the oldest old subjects with eGFR > 60 and
eGFR < 30 had the lowest hand-grip strength and ADL values. Combining eGFR and
frailty status significantly improved the accuracy of frailty in predicting
mortality only in the older sample. In conclusion, a U-shaped relationship exists
between eGFR and mortality in the oldest old, but not in older individuals. Our
findings suggest that eGFR needs to be adjusted for muscle mass/physical
performance when estimating kidney function in people aged 90 or more.
Nevertheless, in subjects aged 65-89 years, eGFR may improve the accuracy of
frailty status in predicting prognosis, thus suggesting that eGFR may represent
an additional dimension of frailty syndrome.

Author information:

Center, Baltimore VA Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Both cognitive and physical function are commonly impaired in 
individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting in important impacts on 
their quality of life and overall health. This review summarizes the burden of
cognitive and physical impairment in CKD, focusing on recent research that
highlights a possible unifying microvascular cause among these shared comorbid
conditions.
RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple small studies have been published recently evaluating
cognitive and physical functioning in people with CKD. These studies overall
demonstrate a high burden of comorbid conditions in people with CKD, including
microvascular disease, that may result in cognitive impairment. Additionally,
studies demonstrate that physical function is substantially worse than expected
in individuals with CKD, that decreased physical activity is associated with
worse outcomes, that frailty is very common and associated with an increased risk
of death, and that structured exercise programs have small but tangible
short-term effects on markers of physical performance.
SUMMARY: Impaired cognitive function and physical performance are important
factors impacting the lives of people with CKD. Further research is necessary to 
better treat these important comorbid conditions in people with CKD.

Frailty and quality of life: a cross-sectional study of Brazilian patients with
pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease.

Mansur HN, Colugnati FA, Grincenkov FR, Bastos MG.

PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces frailty and worsens quality of life
(QOL), even in the early stages of the disease and in young patients. However,
there is a lack of knowledge about the relationship between frailty and QOL in
CKD patients. Thus, we investigated this relationship in a sample of CKD
patients.
METHODS: A cross-observational study was conducted, in which 61 CKD patients
receiving pre-dialysis treatment were assessed. All participants completed the
Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used valid and reliable methods to
classify subjects as frail or non-frail according to Johansen's et al. (2007)
criteria. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were used
to compare the groups. In addition, Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted
to measure associations between identified variables and frailty. We also
performed simple linear regression using the SF-36 physical and mental composite 
scores.
RESULTS: Almost half of the sample (42.6%) exhibited evidence of frailty. The
groups differed significantly in terms of age, gender, and all SF-36 domains,
excluding Social Functioning and Role Emotional. Frailty was significantly
associated with all SF-36 domains, again excluding Social Functioning and Role
Emotional. Regression analysis revealed no significant between-group differences 
in composite physical and mental health scores generated by the SF-36 (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Frail and non-frail CKD patients differed significantly in seven of
the eight SF-36 domains. The frail group displayed diminished physical and mental
functioning when their SF-36 scores were divided by their physical and mental
composite scores. Frailty was correlated with QOL domains, with the exception of 
the social domain. There is a need for interventions targeting the
characteristics of frailty, to provide better treatment and optimize overall QOL.

BACKGROUND: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides
(AAV) can lead to end-stage renal disease in patients with renal involvement.
OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the survival of AAV patients on chronic dialysis 
in France.
METHODS: Between 2002 and 2011, a total of 425 AAV patients started chronic
dialysis and were registered in the Renal Epidemiology and Information Network.
We analysed survival censored for renal transplantation, recovery of renal
function and loss to follow-up. AAV patients were compared with 794 matched
non-AAV patients on chronic dialysis.
RESULTS: A total of 166 (39%) patients with microscopic polyangiitis and 259
(61%) patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis were registered. Within a
median follow-up of 23 months, 58 (14%) patients received a renal allograft and
19 (4%) recovered renal function. Median survival on dialysis was 5.35 years (95%
CI, 4.4-6.3) and survival rates at 3 months, 1, 3 and 5 years were 96%, 85%, 68% 
and 53%, respectively. A total of 143 (41%) patients died after a median of 16
months. Causes of death were cardiovascular (29%), infections (20%), malnutrition
(13%), malignancies (4%), AAV relapse (2%), miscellaneous (14%) and unknown
(18%). Multivariate logistic regression identified three independent risk factors
associated with AAV patients' mortality: age (HR = 1.05/year, P < 0.001),
peripheral artery disease (HR = 2.62, P = 0.003) and frailty (HR = 2.43, P <
0.001). Survival of AAV patients did not differ from non-AAV controls, but
infectious mortality was higher in AAV patients (20% vs. 8%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Survival of AAV patients in chronic dialysis, although poor, was
comparable to survival of non-AAV controls on dialysis. There was a similar
burden of cardiovascular mortality, but higher infectious mortality.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with occlusive or aneurysmal vascular disease are repeatedly 
exposed to intravascular (IV) contrast for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. We
sought to determine the long-term impact of cumulative iodinated IV contrast
exposure (CIVCE) on renal function; the latter was defined by means of National
Kidney Foundation (NKF) criteria.
METHODS: We performed a longitudinal study of consecutive patients without renal 
insufficiency at baseline (NFK stage I or II) who underwent interventions for
arterial occlusive or aneurysmal disease. We collected detailed data on any IV
iodinated contrast exposure (including diagnostic or therapeutic angiography,
cardiac catheterization, IV pyelography, computed tomography with IV contrast,
computed tomographic angiography); medication exposure throughout the observation
period; comorbidities; and demographics. The primary end point was the
development of renal failure (RF) (defined as NFK stage 4 or 5). Analysis was
performed with the use of a shared frailty model with clustering at the patient
level.
RESULTS: Patients (n = 1274) had a mean follow-up of 5.8 (range, 2.2-14) years.
In the multivariate model with RF as the dependent variable and after adjusting
for the statistically significant covariates of baseline renal function (hazard
ratio [HR], 0.95; P < .001), diabetes (HR, 1.8; P = .007), use of an
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (HR, 0.63; P = .03), use of antiplatelets
(HR, 0.5; P = .01), cumulative number of open vascular operations performed (HR, 
1.2; P = .001), and congestive heart failure (HR, 3.2; P < .001), CIVCE remained 
an independent predictor for RF development (HR, 1.1; P < .001). In the
multivariate survival analysis model and after adjusting for the statistically
significant covariates of perioperative myocardial infarction (HR, 3.9; P <
.001), age at entry in the cohort (HR, 1.05; P = .035), total number of open
operations (HR, 1.51; P < .001), and serum albumin (HR, 0.47; P < .001), CIVCE
was an independent predictor of death (HR, 1.07; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative IV contrast exposure is an independent predictor of RF
and death in patients with occlusive and aneurysmal vascular disease.

PURPOSE: Frailty, a multifactorial biological syndrome characterized by a
cumulative dysregulation of physiological processes, is associated with changes
in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The aim of this study was to quantify
the effect of frailty on glomerular filtration of drugs, using the probe drug
gentamicin.
METHODS: Gentamicin concentrations and clinical data including the Reported
Edmonton Frail Scale score were pooled from two prospective observational
inpatient studies, one on prophylactic gentamicin for urologic surgery and one on
therapeutic gentamicin for the empiric treatment of sepsis. Population
pharmacokinetic modeling was performed using non-linear mixed effects modeling
(NONMEM program) to determine the impact of frailty on gentamicin clearance.
RESULTS: A one-compartment linear pharmacokinetic model best described the data
and the addition of frailty to the model reduced the random variability in
gentamicin clearance by 12 % after adjustment for renal function (estimated
creatinine clearance using lean body weight) and lean body weight. Frail patients
had an approximately 12 % lower (bootstrapping results: 14 % median) gentamicin
clearance than non-frail patients (calculated as a fractional effect of frailty).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty may independently predict reduced clearance of gentamicin in
older patients. Frailty could be considered in the development of dosing
guidelines for drugs that undergo significant excretion through glomerular
filtration.

Current and emerging treatment options for the elderly patient with chronic
kidney disease.

The objective of this article is to review the current and emerging treatments of
CKD prior to dialysis in the elderly. Worldwide, there are increasing numbers of 
people who are aged over 65 years. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of
elderly patients presenting with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in
the more advanced stages. The elderly have quite different health care needs
related to their associated comorbidity, frailty, social isolation, poor
functional status, and cognitive decline. Clinical trials assessing treatments
for CKD have usually excluded patients older than 70-75 years; therefore, it is
difficult to translate current therapies recommended for younger patients with
CKD across to the elderly. Many elderly people with CKD progress to end-stage
kidney disease and face the dilemma of whether to undertake dialysis or accept a 
conservative approach supported by palliative care. This places pressure on the
patient, their family, and on health care resources. The clinical trajectory of
elderly CKD patients has in the past been unclear, but recent evidence suggests
that many patients over 75 years of age with multiple comorbidities have greatly 
reduced life expectancies and quality of life, even if they choose dialysis
treatment. Offering a conservative pathway supported by palliative care is a
reasonable option for some patients under these circumstances. The elderly person
who chooses to have dialysis will frequently have different requirements than
younger patients. Kidney transplantation can still result in improved life
expectancy and quality of life in the elderly, in carefully selected people.
There is a genuine need for the inclusion of the elderly in CKD clinical trials
in the future so we can produce evidence-based therapies for this group. In
addition, new therapies to treat and slow CKD progression are needed for all age 
groups.

BACKGROUND: Although dialysis prolongs life for patients with end-stage kidney
disease, 20% of deaths in this population are preceded by dialysis therapy
withdrawal. Recently, there has been more focus on conservative (nondialytic)
care as a legitimate option, particularly for elderly patients. This study aims
to describe patients' and caregivers' perspectives on conservative treatment and 
end-of-life care in chronic kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies.
SETTING & POPULATION: Patients with CKD and caregivers.
SEARCH STRATEGY & SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and reference lists
were searched to May 2013.
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the findings.
RESULTS: 26 studies involving more than 711 patients (non-dialysis dependent
[n=41], hemodialysis [n=544], peritoneal dialysis [n=9]; unspecified dialysis
modality [n=31], conservative management [n=86]) and 178 caregivers were
included. We identified 5 themes: invasive suffering (bodily deterioration, loss 
of freedom and independence, unyielding fatigue and pain, resignation, treatment 
burden and harm, financial strain), personal vulnerability (imminence of death,
misunderstanding and judgment, autonomy and dignity, medical abandonment, trust
and safety), relational responsibility (being a burden, demonstrating loyalty,
protecting others from grief), negotiating existential tensions (accepting
natural course of life, disrupted aging, worthlessness, living on borrowed time, 
respecting sanctity of life, life satisfaction, preserving self-identity), and
preparedness (decisional clarity, informational power, spirituality and hope).
LIMITATIONS: Non-English articles were excluded; therefore, the transferability
of findings to other populations is unclear.
CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with CKD experience physical and psychosocial frailty 
and feel ambivalent about prolonging life. Some caregivers believe in providing
relief from suffering, but are uncertain about making decisions regarding
dialysis therapy initiation and discontinuation. We suggest that CKD management
should encompass palliative care strategies that promote emotional resilience,
sense of well-being, and self-value. Also, respectful and attentive communication
may empower patients to convey their values and preferences about their own care.

Thoughtful decision-making in a patient with cancer and kidney disease requires a
comprehensive discussion of prognosis and therapy options for both conditions
framed by the individual's preferences and goals of care. An estimate of overall 
prognosis is generated that includes the patient's clinical presentation and
parameters associated with adverse outcomes, such as age, performance status,
frailty, malnutrition, and comorbidities. Empathic communication of this
information using a shared decision-making approach can lead to an informed
decision that respects patient autonomy and is consistent with the patient's
"big-picture" goals and personal values.

Uric acid (UA) is produced from purines by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, and
elevated levels may cause arthritis and kidney stones. Conversely, UA also
appears to function as an antioxidant and may protect against the oxidative
stress associated with aging and disease. We performed a prospective fracture
case-cohort study to understand the relation of UA and fracture risk in older men
enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. In the cohort of 5994
men aged 65 years and older attending the baseline MrOS examination, we evaluated
a subgroup 1680 men in a case-cohort study design. The analytic group included
387 men with incident nonspine fractures (73 hip) and a random sample of 1383.
Serum UA was measured in baseline serum samples. Modified proportional hazards
models that account for case-cohort study design were used to estimate the
relative hazards (RH) of hip and nonspine fracture in men for serum UA. Models
were adjusted for age, race, clinic site, body mass index, vitamin D, parathyroid
hormone, walking speed, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) score,
frailty, and total. Subjects with incident nonspine fractures were older, had
lower total hip bone mineral density (BMD), and higher serum phosphorus. There
was an 18% decreased risk of nonspine fractures (95% confidence interval [CI]
0.71-0.93; p = 0.003) per 1 SD increase of baseline serum and 34% decreased risk 
of nonspine fractures in quartile 4 of UA versus quartiles 1, 2, and 3 (95% CI
0.49-0.89; p = 0.028) compared with nonfracture cases after multivariate
adjustment. Hip fractures were not significantly associated with UA. Total hip
BMD was significantly higher in the group of men with high UA levels compared
with lower UA levels and increased linearly across quartiles of UA after
multivariate adjustment (p for trend = 0.002). In summary, higher serum UA levels
were associated with a reduction in risk of incident nonspine fractures but not
hip fractures and higher hip BMD.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Kidney disease is associated with physiologic changes 
that may predispose to frailty. This study sought to investigate whether lower
levels of kidney function were associated with prevalent or incident frailty in
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) participants.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: CHS enrolled community-dwelling
adults age ≥65 years between 1989-1990 and 1992-1993. To examine prevalent
frailty, included were 4150 participants without stroke, Parkinson disease,
prescribed medications for Alzheimer disease or depression, or severely impaired 
cognition. To examine incident frailty, included were a subset of 3459
participants without baseline frailty or development of exclusion criteria during
follow-up. The primary predictor was estimated GFR (eGFR) calculated using serum 
cystatin C (eGFR(cys)). Secondary analyses examined eGFR using serum creatinine
(eGFR(SCr)). Outcomes were prevalent frailty and incident frailty at 4 years of
follow-up. Frailty was ascertained on the basis of weight loss, exhaustion,
weakness, slowness, and low physical activity.
RESULTS: The mean age was 75 years and the median eGFR(cys) was 73 ml/min per
1.73 m(2). Among participants with an eGFR(cys) <45 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), 24% had
prevalent frailty. In multivariable analysis and compared with eGFR(cys) ≥90
ml/min per 1.73 m(2), eGFR(cys) categories of 45-59 (odds ratio [OR], 1.80; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.17 to 2.75) and 15-44 (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.72 to
4.77) were associated with higher odds of frailty, whereas 60-75 (OR, 1.14; 95%
CI, 0.76 to 1.70) was not. In multivariable analysis, eGFR(cys) categories of
60-75 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.75) and 15-44 (IRR,
2.28; 95% CI, 1.23 to 4.22) were associated with higher incidence of frailty
whereas 45-59 (IRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 0.90 to 2.60) was not. Lower levels of
eGFR(SCr) were not associated with higher risk of prevalent or incident frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: In community-dwelling elders, lower eGFR(cys) was associated with a 
higher risk of prevalent and incident frailty whereas lower eGFR(SCr) was not.
These findings highlight the importance of considering non-GFR determinants of
kidney function.

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is prevalent among older adults but is underrecognized
and undertreated. The approach to pain assessment and management in older adults 
requires an understanding of the physiology of aging, validated assessment tools,
and common pain presentations among older adults.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the overall principles of pain management in older adults 
with a specific focus on common painful conditions and approaches to
pharmacologic treatment.
METHODS: We searched PubMed for common pain presentations in older adults with
heart failure, end-stage renal disease, dementia, frailty, and cancer. We also
reviewed guidelines for pain management. Our review encompassed 2 guidelines, 10 
original studies, and 22 review articles published from 2000 to the present. This
review does not discuss nonpharmacologic treatments of pain.
RESULTS: Clinical guidelines support the use of opioids in persistent
nonmalignant pain. Opioids should be used in patients with moderate or severe
pain or pain not otherwise controlled but with careful attention to potential
toxic effects and half-life. In addition, clinical practice guidelines recommend 
use of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with extreme caution and for
defined, limited periods.
CONCLUSION: An understanding of the basics of pain pathophysiology, assessment,
pharmacologic management, and a familiarity with common pain presentations will
allow clinicians to effectively manage pain for older adults.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a condition characterized by a decline in physical
function and functional capacity. Common symptoms of frailty, such as weakness
and exhaustion, are prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The 
increased vulnerability of frail patients with coexisting CKD may place them at a
heightened risk of encountering additional health complications. The purpose of
this systematic review was to explore the link between frailty, CKD and clinical 
outcomes.
METHODS: We searched for cross sectional and prospective studies in the general
population and in the CKD population indexed in EMBASE, Pubmed, Web of Science,
CINAHL, Cochrane and Ageline examining the association between frailty and CKD
and those relating frailty in patients with CKD to clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: We screened 5,066 abstracts and retrieved 108 studies for full text
review. We identified 7 studies associating frailty or physical function to CKD. 
From the 7 studies, we identified only two studies that related frailty in
patients with CKD to a clinical outcome. CKD was consistently associated with
increasing frailty or reduced physical function [odds ratios (OR) 1.30 to 3.12]. 
In patients with CKD, frailty was associated with a greater than two-fold higher 
risk of dialysis and/or death [OR from 2.0 to 5.88].
CONCLUSIONS: CKD is associated with a higher risk of frailty or diminished
physical function. Furthermore, the presence of frailty in patients with CKD may 
lead to a higher risk of mortality. Further research must be conducted to
understand the mechanisms of frailty in CKD and to confirm its association with
clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Advanced glycation endproducts are biologically active compounds that
accumulate in disordered metabolism and normal aging. Carboxymethyl-lysine (CML),
a ubiquitous human advanced glycation endproduct, has been associated with
age-related conditions and mortality. Our objective was to ascertain the
relationship between CML and geriatric outcomes (disability and frailty) in a
large cohort of older men and women.
METHODS: In 1996-1997, serum CML was measured in 3,373 Cardiovascular Health
Study participants (mean age 78.1 ± 4.8 years). Disability, defined as difficulty
in any of six activities of daily living, was assessed every 6-12 months for 14
years. Frailty was defined according to five standard criteria at the 1996-1997
visit. Cox proportional hazard models estimated the relationship between CML and 
incident disability (N = 2,643). Logistic regression models estimated the
relationship between CML and prevalent frailty.
RESULTS: Adjusting for multiple potential confounders, higher CML was associated 
with incident disability (hazard ratio per standard deviation [225 ng/mL]
increase: 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.11). In men, odds of frailty increased with higher 
CML values (odds ratio = 1.30 per standard deviation, 95% CI 1.14-1.48), but the 
relationship was attenuated by adjustment for cognitive status, kidney function, 
and arthritis. CML was not associated with frailty in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum CML levels in late life are associated with incident
disability and prevalent frailty. Further work is needed to understand CML's
value as a risk stratifier, biomarker, or target for interventions that promote
healthy aging.

Although the management of diabetes as a simple entity has been extensively
developed, there is a dearth of evidence in elderly, frail patients with multiple
comorbidities and polymedication. This population represents a large proportion
of the residents of nursing homes (NHs). As a multidisciplinary group of French
experts (geriatricians, endocrinologists, diabetologists, and general
practitioners) with practical experience in this area, which is growing in
magnitude throughout the world, we convened to compile pragmatic, simple advice
on the management of elderly, frail diabetic patients. Given demands on NH
personnel (manager, medical coordinator, nurses, and, at the front line of care
provision, the undertrained and overworked carers), coupled with the
quasiconstant of high staff turnover, the foundation stone of a patient's
diabetes management is an Individual Care Plan (ICP) expressed in layman's
language. This document that is opened on the patient's admission aims to make
sure that the prescriptions established at admission are followed, notably to
ensure correct treatment and adapted, regular monitoring with dates and times
when examinations and tests are due. This includes monitoring of the diabetes
control (HbA1c and, if necessary, blood and urine glucose) and its complications 
(cardiovascular disease, hypoglycemia, ocular problems, foot disorders,
malnutrition, peripheral neuropathy, kidney failure). A necessary corollary is
the training of staff to understand the specificities of caring for a frail
patient with diabetes, on what to do in a potential emergency, and how to keep
the ICP up to date for consultation by doctors and nurses.

BACKGROUND: Poor physical performance and frailty are associated with elevated
risks of death and disability. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also strongly
associated with these outcomes. The risks of poor physical performance and
frailty among CKD patients, however, are not well established.
METHODS: We measured the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; a summary test
of gait speed, chair raises and balance; range 0-12) and the five elements of
frailty among 1,111 Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants. Adjusting
for demographics and multiple comorbidities, we fit a linear regression model for
the outcome of SPPB score and an ordinal logistic regression model for frailty
status.
RESULTS: Median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 65 (57-71) years, median
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for non-dialysis patients was 49
(36-62) ml/min/1.73 m(2), and median SPPB score was 9 (7-10). Seven percent of
participants were frail and 43% were pre-frail. Compared with the SPPB score for 
eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), the SPPB was 0.51 points lower for eGFR 30-59; 0.61
points lower for eGFR 15-29, and 1.75 points lower for eGFR <15 (p < 0.01 for all
comparisons). eGFR 30-59 (odds ratio, OR 1.45; p = 0.024), eGFR 15-29 (OR 2.02; p
= 0.002) and eGFR <15 (OR 4.83; p < 0.001) were associated with worse frailty
status compared with eGFR >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2).
CONCLUSIONS: CKD severity was associated with poor physical performance and
frailty in a graded fashion. Future trials should determine if outcomes for CKD
patients with frailty and poor physical performance are improved by targeted
interventions.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite guidelines supporting the regular assessment of
physical functioning and encouragement of physical activity in management of the 
patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), implementation has been undermined by 
a lack of understanding of the evidence for this recommendation. The purpose of
this review is to present a summary of emerging data from larger epidemiologic
cohorts that report associations between low levels of physical functioning
and/or low physical activity and clinical outcomes in patients with CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: Low levels of physical activity and poor physical functioning
are strongly associated with mortality and poor clinical outcomes in adult
patients with CKD, regardless of treatment modality. Low physical performance and
activity limitations are more prevalent in patients with CKD, regardless of age, 
compared to older community-dwelling adults.
SUMMARY: The strength of the evidence presented should strongly motivate a focus 
of treatment on assessing and improving physical activity and physical function
as part of routine patient-centered management of persons with CKD. Physical
activity interventions are warranted because patients with CKD, regardless of
age, have a high prevalence of low physical functioning and frailty that is
similar to or higher than the general population of elderly adults; physical
activity, physical function, and performance are strongly associated with
all-cause mortality; and exercise training and exercise counseling have been
shown to improve measures of physical functioning.

Frailty is a physiologic state of increased vulnerability to stressors that
results from decreased physiologic reserves or dysregulation of multiple
physiologic systems. The construct of frailty has been operationalized as a
composite of poor physical function, exhaustion, low physical activity, and
weight loss. Several studies have now examined the prevalence of frailty among
chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and have 
found frailty to be more common among individuals with CKD than among those
without. Furthermore, frailty is associated with adverse outcomes among incident 
dialysis patients, including higher risk of hospitalization and death. Recent
evidence shows that frail patients are started on dialysis earlier (at a higher
estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) on average than nonfrail patients,
but it remains unclear whether these patients' frailty is a result of uremia or
is independent of CKD. The survival disadvantage that has been associated with
early initiation of dialysis in observational studies could be mediated in part
through confounding on the basis of unmeasured frailty. However, available data
do not suggest improvement in frailty upon initiation of dialysis; rather, the
trajectory appears to be toward higher levels of dependence in activities of
daily living (ADLs) after dialysis initiation. Overall, there are no data to
suggest that frail patients derive any benefit from early initiation of dialysis 
either in the form of improved survival or functional status.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether higher cystatin C would be associated with
greater frailty in men aged 65 and older.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study.
SETTING: Six U.S. sites.
PARTICIPANTS: A random sample of community-dwelling men aged 65 and older
enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study (mean age 73.8; 9.8%
frail and 47.2% intermediate frailty; N = 1,602).
MEASUREMENTS: Serum cystatin C, creatinine, and frailty were measured. Frailty
was analyzed as an ordinal outcome of robust, intermediate frailty, and frail
using a multinomial logistic regression model, and the base model was adjusted
for age, race, and clinical site.
RESULTS: Higher cystatin C was associated with seven times greater odds of being 
frail than being robust (odds ratio (OR) quartile 4 vs 1 = 7.12, 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 3.76-13.46) and 2.4 times greater odds of intermediate frailty
than robust (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.70-3.32). The association was 
attenuated but persisted after adjusting for multiple possible confounders. In
contrast, neither higher serum creatinine (OR quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.36, 95% CI =
0.78-2.40) nor lower creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR
quartile 4 vs 1 = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.54-1.87) was associated in a graded manner
with greater odds of frailty.
CONCLUSION: Higher cystatin C, but not creatinine-based measures, was associated 
with greater odds of frailty in this cohort of older men.

BACKGROUND: Observational studies of preventive medications, such as
vaccinations, can suffer from the healthy-user bias because vaccinated patients
may be healthier than unvaccinated patients. Indicators of health status and
frailty suitable for attenuating this bias could be identified in administrative 
data.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of baseline variables and time-dependent
hospitalization and skilled nursing care with the receipt of influenza
vaccination in patients with end-stage renal disease.
RESEARCH DESIGN: Observational cohort study using United States Renal Data System
files each year from 1999 to 2005.
SUBJECTS: Population-based cohorts that included >115,000 adult, hemodialysis
patients each year.
MEASURES: We estimated hazard ratios for the association of baseline variables
and time-dependent hospitalization days and skilled nursing days with influenza
vaccination, controlling for demographic and baseline health status variables.
RESULTS: Vaccination coverage increased from 47% in 1999 to 60% in 2005. Patients
with any length of hospitalization were less likely to be vaccinated, however,
the association was stronger in patients with longer stays [15-25 d: hazard
ratio=0.64 (95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.65); 26-30 d: 0.40 (0.38-0.42)].
Patients with any length of skilled nursing care of >1 day had similar estimates;
these patients were also less likely to be vaccinated [26-30 d: 0.66
(0.64-0.69)].
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with long hospitalizations or skilled nursing stays were
less likely to be vaccinated suggesting evidence of the healthy-user effect.
These variables could be used to account for bias in studies of preventive
services in patients on dialysis.

Evidence has recently been building that the presence of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is an independent contributor to decline in physical and cognitive
functions in older adults. CKD affects 45% of persons older than 70 years of age 
and can double the risk for physical impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and
frailty. To increase awareness of this relatively new concept of CKD as a risk
factor for accelerated aging, we review studies on the association of CKD with
physical function, frailty, and cognitive function. We also present a summary of 
the proposed mechanisms for these associations.

AIMS: Aging and drug-induced side effects may contribute to deteriorate
mitochondrial bioenergetics in many tissues, including kidney and liver. One
possibility is that the combination of both aging and drug toxicity accelerates
the process of mitochondrial degradation, leading to progressive bioenergetic
disruption. We therefore analyzed in vitro kidney (KM) and liver (LM)
mitochondrial response to salicylate and diclofenac in old and adult animals.
MAIN METHODS: Male-Wistar adult (19-wks) and aged (106-wks) rats were used. In
vitro endpoints of oxygen consumption and membrane potential were evaluated in
non-treated conditions (vehicle) and in the presence of salicylate (0.5mM) and
diclofenac (50μM). The susceptibility to calcium-induced permeability transition 
pore (MPTP) was assessed. Aconitase and C, -SH and MDA contents were measured.
Apoptotic signaling was followed by measuring caspase 3, 8 and 9 activities, Bax,
Bcl2 and CypD expression. ANT content was semi-quantified.
KEY FINDINGS: In general, animal age alone compromised KM state 3 and LM ADP lag 
phase while resulting in decreased resistance to the MPTP. Aging decreased LM
CypD and increased Mn-SOD. Kidney caspase 9-like activity was lower in aged
group. Salicylate and diclofenac induced KM and LM dysfunction. ADP lag phase in 
KM was further increased in the aged group in the presence of diclofenac. No
further impairments were observed regarding drug toxicity adding to the aging
process.
SIGNIFICANCE: Aging impaired KM and LM function despite no detected alterations
on oxidative stress and apoptosis. However, aging did not further exacerbate KM
and LM frailty induced by salicylate and diclofenac.

An appropriate treatment of elderly rheumatic patients implements comprehensive
diagnostics and exclusion diagnostics of e.g. coronary heart disease,
osteoporosis, renal failure, diabetes mellitus type 2 and thyroid gland
dysfunction. Furthermore, the complex disease situation might require the
integration of other faculties or might be a reason for inpatient treatment. The 
complexity in the treatment of multimorbid elderly patients suffering from
rheumatism not only rises with increasing age but also constitutes a considerable
challenge due to existing incapacities and preceding as well as currently
performed immunosuppressive therapies. The necessary treatment framework is
outlined from the perspective of rheumatologists and geriatricians. Typical
geriatric symptoms, such as malnutrition, immobility and frailty might be
enhanced if multimorbidity is simultaneously present.

BACKGROUND: Changes in anemia management over the past decade have produced
downward shifts in hemoglobin concentrations. We aimed to examine the effect on
use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: We identified point prevalent Medicare hemodialysis
patients as of January 1 of each year (1999-2010) and categorized them based on
3-month (April to June) mean hemoglobin levels (<10 or ≥10 g/dL) in each year.
PREDICTORS: Hemoglobin patterns over time and clinical profiles based on achieved
hemoglobin concentrations.
OUTCOMES: RBC transfusion use.
MEASUREMENTS: We used negative binomial modeling to examine the effect of
hemoglobin level <10 g/dL on transfusion use, adjusting for case-mix differences.
RESULTS: Proportions of patients with mean hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL decreased
from 10% (1999) to ~4% (2005), but began increasing after 2006 and reached 6% by 
2010. Accounting for case-mix differences, transfusion rates remained relatively 
constant at approximately 7.9 per 100 person-months for patients with hemoglobin 
levels <10 g/dL and 2 per 100 person-months for patients with hemoglobin levels
≥10 g/dL. Patients with average hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL were more likely to
receive transfusions (risk ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 2.1-2.2) even after adjustment;
the risk ratio doubled if hemoglobin levels remained <10 g/dL for 6 months (4.4; 
95% CI, 3.7-5.2).
LIMITATIONS: Limited in generalizability to patients with Medicare as primary
payer; residual confounding from factors such as frailty and chronic inflammation
cannot be excluded; categorizing patients based on an average of 3 outpatient
hemoglobin measurements may introduce some misclassification.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk of transfusion increases substantially with hemoglobin
concentrations <10 g/dL; risk appears to be independent of other clinical
factors. If anemia management patterns shift toward lower hemoglobin
concentrations, RBC transfusion use likely will increase in dialysis patients.

Bone fracture risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much higher
than that in healthy subjects. Frailty caused by neuromuscular impairment as well
as bone fragility due to bone loss and impaired bone quality is thought to be
involved in the elevated fracture risk in CKD. Altered material and structural
properties might be attributed to the reduced bone strength. The structural
properties in CKD patients are characterized in 1) cortical thinning and cortical
porosity, and 2) irregular thickening and loss of connectivity in trabecular
bone. Interestingly, recent findings suggest that skeletal changes in the
structural properties may be initiated at earlier stage of CKD than we expected.

Nephrologists have focused on the uremic syndrome as an indication for dialysis. 
The elderly frail renal patient approaching ESRD represents a complex biologic
system that is already failing. This patient phenotype exhibits progressive
geriatric disabilities and dependence interspersed with shrinking periods of
stability regardless of whether dialysis is started. Consequently, the frail
renal patient faces challenging treatment choices underpinned by ethical
tensions. Identifying the advanced frail renal patient and optimizing the shared 
decision-making process will enable him or her to make well informed choices
based on an understanding of his or her overall condition and personal values and
preferences. This approach will also permit nephrologists to fulfill their
ethical obligations to respect patient autonomy, promote patient benefit, and
minimize patient harm.

Early hospital readmission (EHR) after kidney transplantation (KT) is associated 
with increased morbidity and higher costs. Registry-based recipient, transplant
and center-level predictors of EHR are limited, and novel predictors are needed. 
We hypothesized that frailty, a measure of physiologic reserve initially
described and validated in geriatrics and recently associated with early KT
outcomes, might serve as a novel, independent predictor of EHR in KT recipients
of all ages. We measured frailty in 383 KT recipients at Johns Hopkins Hospital. 
EHR was ascertained from medical records as ≥1 hospitalization within 30 days of 
initial post-KT discharge. Frail KT recipients were much more likely to
experience EHR (45.8% vs. 28.0%, p = 0.005), regardless of age. After adjusting
for previously described registry-based risk factors, frailty independently
predicted 61% higher risk of EHR (adjusted RR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.18-2.19, p =
0.002). In addition, frailty improved EHR risk prediction by improving the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (p = 0.01) as well as the net
reclassification index (p = 0.04). Identifying frail KT recipients for targeted
outpatient monitoring and intervention may reduce EHR rates.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and outcomes in patients undergoing
transvenous transseptal (TS) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
BACKGROUND: TS approach for TAVR was abandoned in favor of retrograde
transfemoral, transaortic, or transapical approaches. TS TAVR may still be
warranted in patients for whom no other approach is feasible.
METHODS: Observational consecutive case series at a single center, to evaluate
technical outcomes in inoperable patients with aortic stenosis who had
contraindications for other approaches and who underwent TAVR via a transvenous
TS antegrade approach using the Edwards-Sapien (ES) valve.
RESULTS: Over a 4-month period, 9 patients underwent TS TAVR with 26 mm (n = 4)
and 23 mm (n = 5) ES valves. Mean age was 84.5 ± 6.6 years and Society of
Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality was 7.8 ± 2.8%. Specific
contraindications for other access included iliofemoral arterial diameter <7 mm
in 9 (100%), porcelain aorta in 6 (66%) patients, multiple (≥2) sternotomies in 2
(22%) patients, severe pulmonary disease in 3 (33%), extreme frailty in 1 (11%), 
spinal stenosis with impaired ability to rehabilitate postsurgery in 1 (11%) and 
apical left ventricular thrombus in 1 (11%) patient. Antegrade deployment of the 
ES prosthetic valve was technically feasible in 8 patients. Major bleeding
occurred in 4 patients, two patients suffered acute kidney injury without need
for dialysis and one patient required a permanent pacemaker. The median (25th,
75th percentiles) fluoroscopy time was 49 (34, 81) minutes and contrast volume
was 150 (120, 225) ml. No patient had hemodynamically significant post-TAVR
aortic insufficiency nor damage to the mitral valve. At 6 months follow-up, there
were no cerebrovascular events or rehospitalizations and mean NYHA Class improved
from 3.4 to 1.7.
CONCLUSIONS: The antegrade TS approach to TAVR is a technically feasible option
for "no-access" patients. Prospective assessment of the safety and efficacy of
this approach in the current era warrants further study.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Uromodulin-associated kidney disease (UAKD) is an
autosomal dominant disease caused by uromodulin (UMOD) gene mutations. This study
explored genotype-phenotype correlations by examining the relationship between
the type of UMOD mutation and the age at onset of ESRD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: Extensive bibliographic research
was used to ascertain patient-level data of all patients with UAKD published up
to October 2011. Data included sex; ages at onset of hyperuricemia, gout, and
ESRD; and UMOD genotype. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards
models fitted with shared gamma frailty terms to adjust for within-family
correlations were used to model time to event.
RESULTS: Thirty-one peer-reviewed publications reporting on 202 patients from 74 
families with 59 different UMOD mutations were included. Median ages at onset of 
hyperuricemia, gout, and ESRD were 24, 40, and 56 years, respectively. Men
developed gout and ESRD significantly earlier than did women (age at ESRD was 50 
years for men and 60 for women; P=0.04, shared frailty model). Median ages at
ESRD development were lowest with Cys77Tyr (37.5 years) and highest with
Gln316Pro (65.5 years) UMOD mutations. Onset of ESRD was significantly earlier
with UMOD mutations located within the epidermal growth factor domains 2 and 3
(range, 45-52 years; P<0.01 and 0.04, respectively) compared with the
cysteine-rich domains (range, 60-65 years; by shared frailty model).
CONCLUSIONS: The UMOD genotype is related to the clinical phenotype of UAKD. This
finding may assist in counseling of patients.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the prevalence of frailty in adults of all ages
undergoing chronic hemodialysis, its relationship to comorbidity and disability, 
and its association with adverse outcomes of mortality and hospitalization.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Single hemodialysis center in Baltimore, Maryland.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-six individuals undergoing hemodialysis enrolled 
between January 2009 and March 2010 and followed through August 2012.
MEASUREMENTS: Frailty, comorbidity, and disability on enrollment in the study and
subsequent mortality and hospitalizations.
RESULTS: At enrollment, 50.0% of older (≥ 65) and 35.4% of younger (<65)
individuals undergoing hemodialysis were frail; 35.9% and 29.3%, respectively,
were intermediately frail. Three-year mortality was 16.2% for nonfrail, 34.4% for
intermediately frail, and 40.2% for frail participants. Intermediate frailty and 
frailty were associated with a 2.7 times (95% confidence interval (CI) =
1.02-7.07, P = .046) and 2.6 times (95% CI = 1.04-6.49, P = .04) greater risk of 
death independent of age, sex, comorbidity, and disability. In the year after
enrollment, median number of hospitalizations was 1 (interquartile range 0-3).
The proportion with two or more hospitalizations was 28.2% for nonfrail, 25.5%
for intermediately frail, and 42.6% for frail participants. Although intermediate
frailty was not associated with number of hospitalizations (relative risk = 0.76,
95% CI = 0.49-1.16, P = .21), frailty was associated with 1.4 times (95% CI =
1.00-2.03, P = .049) more hospitalizations independent of age, sex, comorbidity, 
and disability. The association between frailty and mortality (interaction P =
.64) and hospitalizations (P = .14) did not differ between older and younger
participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Adults of all ages undergoing hemodialysis have a high prevalence of
frailty, more than five times as high as community-dwelling older adults. In this
population, regardless of age, frailty is a strong, independent predictor of
mortality and number of hospitalizations.

An estimating function approach to the analysis of recurrent and terminal events.

In clinical and observational studies, the event of interest can often recur on
the same subject. In a more complicated situation, there exists a terminal event 
(e.g., death) which stops the recurrent event process. In many such instances,
the terminal event is strongly correlated with the recurrent event process. We
consider the recurrent/terminal event setting and model the dependence through a 
shared gamma frailty that is included in both the recurrent event rate and
terminal event hazard functions. Conditional on the frailty, a model is specified
only for the marginal recurrent event process, hence avoiding the strong
Poisson-type assumptions traditionally used. Analysis is based on estimating
functions that allow for estimation of covariate effects on the recurrent event
rate and terminal event hazard. The method also permits estimation of the degree 
of association between the two processes. Closed-form asymptotic variance
estimators are proposed. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations to 
assess the applicability of the asymptotic results in finite samples and the
sensitivity of the method to its underlying assumptions. The methods can be
extended in straightforward ways to accommodate multiple types of recurrent and
terminal events. Finally, the methods are illustrated in an analysis of
hospitalization data for patients in an international multi-center study of
outcomes among dialysis patients.

Although sarcopenia is thought to underlie the manifestations of frailty,
association of frailty with measures of body composition is
underinvestigated.METHODS: Eighty hemodialysis patients were included in the
study. Performance-based frailty (PbF) used gait speed over 20 feet and 5
sit-to-stand (1 point each for lowest quintile) for the physical components of
the frailty phenotype plus exhaustion (Short Form-36 [SF-36] vitality score <55) 
and physical activity (lowest quintile of weekly kcal energy expenditure on
leisure activity on the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly questionnaire; 1 
point). Function-based frailty (FbF) defined by questionnaire measures of
physical functioning (SF-36 Physical Function score <75; 1 point), exhaustion,
and physical activity as for PbF. A score of 2 or greater was defined as frail.
Outcomes related to muscle size included muscle area of the contractile tissue of
the anterior tibialis and quadriceps muscles using magnetic resonance imaging,
phase angle using bioimpedance analysis, lean body mass using dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry, and body mass index (BMI). Linear regression was used to analyze 
associations between frailty and muscle size, with and without sex and age
covariates.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of individuals met PbF criteria, 63% met FbF
criteria, and 55% met both. In univariate analysis, PbF and FbF were associated
with smaller muscle area of the quadriceps, smaller phase angle, and higher BMI. 
Associations remained significant for the quadriceps after adjustment for age and
sex. The magnitude of association of PbF with quadriceps muscle area was greater 
than 10 years of age (-30.3 cm(2)P = .02 vs. -6.6 cm(2)P < .0001) in multivariate
analysis. There was no significant association between either measure of frailty 
and other measures of body composition after adjustment for age and sex.
CONCLUSION: Frailty was associated with measurements related to muscle size in a 
population of individuals with chronic kidney disease, a known contributor to
muscle wasting.

The authors offered to 296 consecutive cancer patients aged > or = 70 to undergo 
a joint comprehensive geriatric and oncological assessment. After
pluridisciplinary discussion, several reflections have emerged: the need in 15 - 
32% of cases to reinforce the role of the paramedical staff; the correlation
between age, low clinical indices, alteration of renal function as well as
geriatric characteristics; 67% of evaluated cases presented a significant
geriatric profile; recommendations for patients' management in relation to their 
pattern of frailty and health aging (standard, adapted or palliative treatment).

CKD is associated with impairments in health status, physical function, and
frailty. The aim of the current prospective cohort study was to determine whether
CKD predicted new LTCI need certification among community-dwelling older Japanese
adults. This was a prospective cohort study. We analyzed the cohort data from a
prospective study, The Japan Multicenter Aging Cohort for Care Prevention
(J-MACC). We followed 8063 elderly adults for 2 years, and we analyzed the
relationship between CKD and LTCI need. The outcome studied was new certification
for LTCI service need during a 2-year period. We measured serum creatinine (the
estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR), serum albumin, frailty checklist
scores, and body mass index. During the 2-year follow-up, 536 subjects (6.6%)
were newly certified as needing LTCI services. We stratified the cohort according
to eGFR quartile and performed multivariate analyses using an eGFR value of
71.4-83.6 ml/min/1.73 m(2) as a reference. We found that subjects with eGFR
values <60.0 ml/min/1.73 m(2) had a significantly elevated risk of LTCI service
need (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.44 [95% CI 1.12-1.86]). Our results indicate that 
CKD is independently associated with new LTCI service need certification and is
an important marker of frailty in older adults.

INTRODUCTION: Combination antiretroviral therapy has enabled HIV-infected persons
to reach older ages in high numbers. Hepatic and renal changes that normally
occur with advancing age occur earlier and with higher incidence in HIV-infected 
individuals. A limited number of prospective controlled studies have demonstrated
small reductions (17 to 41%) in lopinavir, atazanavir and lamivudine clearance in
older versus younger adults. A much larger number of retrospective studies in
adults (age range ∼ 20 to 60 years), including all antiretroviral drugs, have
evaluated age as a covariate for pharmacokinetics. Most studies did not detect
substantial associations between drug exposures and age.
AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes antiretroviral drug pharmacokinetics in
older persons. The authors review articles from PubMed (search terms: elderly,
antiretroviral, pharmacokinetics) in addition to the bibliographies of those
selected.
EXPERT OPINION: The evidence to date does not support major pharmacokinetic
changes in adults between ∼ 20 and 60 years of age. However, additional
prospective, well-controlled studies are needed in more persons > 60 years,
including those with frailty and comorbidities, with assessment of unbound drug
clearance, and incorporation of adherence, pharmacogenetics and concomitant
medications. Until then, guidelines for drug-drug interactions and dosing in
renal and hepatic impairment should be followed in older HIV-infected
individuals.

Protein-energy wasting (PEW), a term proposed by the International Society of
Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM), refers to the multiple nutritional and
catabolic alterations that occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associate
with morbidity and mortality. To increase awareness, identify research needs, and
provide the basis for future work to understand therapies and consequences of
PEW, ISRNM provides this consensus statement of current knowledge on the etiology
of PEW syndrome in CKD. Although insufficient food intake (true undernutrition)
due to poor appetite and dietary restrictions contribute, other highly prevalent 
factors are required for the full syndrome to develop. These include
uremia-induced alterations such as increased energy expenditure, persistent
inflammation, acidosis, and multiple endocrine disorders that render a state of
hypermetabolism leading to excess catabolism of muscle and fat. In addition,
comorbid conditions associated with CKD, poor physical activity, frailty, and the
dialysis procedure per se further contribute to PEW.

We present the case and radiologic images of an 85-year-old woman who presented
with a left loin abscess secondary to a left staghorn calculus and a
nonfunctioning left kidney. We examined the rationale behind the eventual
decision to pursue conservative treatment in the form of incision and drainage
rather than nephrectomy. This was because of the patient's frailty and the
presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in close proximity to the left kidney.
The radiologic images are of great quality and interest because they display the 
pathologic findings very clearly. Our brief case report outlines the
decision-making process.

BACKGROUND: Deficiencies in management have been highlighted as contributory
factors in the death of many patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). However,
there is little evidence addressing the quality of care provided to patients with
milder AKI.
AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of care provided to a
non-select cohort of patients with AKI and evaluate discrepancies in causation,
recognition and management.
DESIGN: Retrospective inception cohort study.
METHODS: Demographic data were collected for all 1577 patients admitted to a
University Teaching Hospital during a 1-month period. Baseline, admission and
peak creatinine were correlated with mortality and length of hospital admission. 
AKI was classified according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
criteria. A retrospective case note review of all patients with AKI was carried
out to evaluate quality of documentation and clinical management of AKI.
Multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine risk factors for AKI.
RESULTS: Incidence of AKI on admission was 4.6%. A further 10.3% developed AKI
while in hospital. All cause mortality was 4-fold higher among patients with AKI 
compared with those without (19 vs. 3.8%; P < 0.001). Mortality was significantly
higher in those patients who developed AKI while an in-patient compared with
those with AKI on admission (27.3 vs. 11.8%; P < 0.001). Diabetes, clinician
perception of frailty, age and treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor prior to admission were found to be independent risk factors for AKI.
AKI was unrecognized in 23.5% of patients, two-thirds of whom were discharged
without resolution of renal function. Significant weaknesses in management were
poorly kept fluid balance charts (48.2%), failure to withhold nephrotoxic drugs
(38.8%) and failure to act upon abnormal biochemistry (41%) in a timely fashion.
CONCLUSION: AKI is common in hospitalized patients and associated with a
significant increase in hospital stay and mortality. AKI is often found in
conjunction with other organ failure and in many cases is not preventable.
Nevertheless clinicians need to be more vigilant of small creatinine rises to
permit early intervention particularly among elderly and frail patients.

Older people constitute an increasingly greater proportion of patients with
advanced CKD, including those patients undergoing maintenance dialysis treatment.
Frailty is a biologic syndrome of decreased reserve and resistance to stressors
that results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and
causes vulnerability to adverse outcomes. Frailty is common in elderly CKD
patients, and it may be associated with protein-energy wasting (PEW), sarcopenia,
dynapenia, and other complications of CKD. Causes of frailty with or without PEW 
in the elderly with CKD can be classified into three categories: causes primarily
caused by aging per se, advanced CKD per se, or a combination of both conditions.
Frailty and PEW in elderly CKD patients are associated with impaired physical
performance, disability, poorer quality of life, and reduced survival. Prevention
and treatment of these conditions in the elderly CKD patients often require a
multifaceted approach. Here, we examine the causes and consequences of these
conditions and examine the interplay between frailty and PEW in elderly CKD
patients.

The end-stage renal disease population is aging. Nearly half of all new patients 
are older than 65 years and one third are older than 70 years. Assessing the
possibility of transplantation for older patients with end-stage renal disease
often involves contemplating more complex issues, including cognitive impairment,
decreased functional status, and frailty, which makes selecting appropriate
candidates more difficult. Older transplant recipients have decreased patient and
transplant survival compared with younger recipients. For example, 75% of
deceased donor transplant recipients aged 30-49 years are alive after 5 years
compared to only 61% for those older than 65 years. Despite poorer outcomes
compared with younger recipients, older transplant recipients have a significant 
improvement in survival compared with similar patients who remain on the wait
list, with decreases in mortality of 41%-61% depending on the study. Use of
living donors, even older living donors, provides significantly better outcomes
for elderly recipients compared with the use of deceased donors. However, in the 
absence of a living donor, survival is improved significantly by accepting an
expanded criteria donor organ rather than waiting for a standard criteria
deceased donor. Older transplant recipients experience more infectious
complications and less acute rejection, but the risk of transplant loss from
rejection is increased compared with younger patients. These immunologic issues, 
along with the fact that older patients often are excluded from transplant
trials, have made selecting an ideal immunosuppressive regimen challenging.
Prospective comparative trials of different agents in the elderly population are 
warranted to better define the risk-benefit profile. This review discusses
transplantation outcomes, including patient and transplant survival, different
donor types, quality of life, and immunosuppression for older dialysis patients.

Though bone loss tends to accelerate with age there are modifiable factors that
may influence the rate of bone loss even in very old men.INTRODUCTION: The aim of
this 2-year longitudinal study was to examine potential predictors of change in
total hip bone mineral density (BMD) in older men.
METHODS: The Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project is a population-based study
in Sydney, Australia. For this study, 1,122 men aged 70-97 years had baseline and
follow-up measures of total hip BMD measured with dual X-ray absorptiometry. Data
about mobility, muscle strength, balance, medication use, cognition, medical
history and lifestyle factors were collected using questionnaires and clinical
assessments. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was also measured. Multivariate 
linear regression models were used to assess relationships between baseline
predictors and change in BMD.
RESULTS: Over a mean of 2.2 years, there was a mean annualised loss of total hip 
BMD of 0.006 g/cm(2)/year (0.6 %) and hip BMC of 0.14 g/year (0.3 %). Annual BMD 
loss accelerated with increasing age, from 0.4 % in men aged between 70 and 75
years, to 1.2 % in men aged 85+ years. In multivariate regression models,
predictors of faster BMD loss were anti-androgen, thiazolidinedione and
loop-diuretic medications, kidney disease, poor dynamic balance, larger hip bone 
area, older age and lower serum 25(OH)D. Factors associated with attenuated bone 
loss were walking for exercise and use of beta-blocker medications. Change in BMD
was not associated with baseline BMD, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, frailty,
or osteoarthritis.
CONCLUSION: There was considerable variation in the rate of hip bone loss in
older men. Walking, better balance and beta blockers may attenuate the
acceleration of BMD loss that occurs with age.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor is
recommended for use as first-line therapy in patients with acute coronary
syndromes (ACS) who undergo high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention.
However, revascularization may not be a beneficial option for some subgroups of
patients with ACS. This includes a broad spectrum of lower risk patients as well 
as high-risk patients with numerous previous revascularizations and those who are
at high risk for complications, such as those with complex coronary anatomy and
co-morbidities such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or advanced age
and frailty. For such patients, there remains an unmet need for evaluation of
alternatives to the currently recommended treatment options. Notably, there is a 
paucity of prospective data regarding management approaches to medically managed 
patients with ACS. Thus, this group of medically managed patients with ACS would 
benefit from inclusion in clinical trials investigating therapeutic options for
patients not scheduled to undergo invasive procedures, such as those who are
targeted for pharmacologic management only. In conclusion, in this review, the
investigators revisit data from clinical studies of dual-antiplatelet therapy in 
ACS to highlight areas of unmet need in antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS
and to examine the use of newer agents in subgroups, such as medically managed
patients with ACS, that would potentially benefit from more potent platelet
inhibition after ACS.

The metaphor of a frail older person as a car running out of petrol seems to have
resonance in the lay media. Though it may be an over simplistic representation of
a complex and dynamic process, it does facilitate discussion with patients and
their relatives about the appropriateness of interventions, such as whether or
not there is enough fuel (physiological reserves) to get up a really steep hill
(undergo a coronary bypass graft). It can also be used as a way to emphasise what
can be done to help. For example, in some longitudinal studies, 5% of older
patients are less frail after 5 years follow up, suggesting there are things that
can still be done to "fill up the tank". This review will consider whether drug
therapies can fulfil this role. Frail older people are often prescribed long
lists of medications but it is debatable whether current treatments actually
address the causes or consequences of frailty itself. Here, we explore the
associations between frailty and co-morbidity and evaluate whether the management
of chronic disease may impact frailty development or progression. We consider how
the management of hypertension may have an important role in the prevention of
frailty, mediated by reduction of cerebrovascular disease, but why aggressive
management of hypertension may have negative consequences for those who are
already frail. We also summarise the evidence linking immunosenescence,
inflammation and endocrine changes to frailty and investigate whether targeted
drug therapy has the potential to influence frailty pathophysiology.

Next to a high morbidity, patients with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) suffer
from a complex spectrum of clinical manifestations. Both the phenotype of
patients with ESRD as well as the pathophysiology of uremia show interesting
parallels with the general aging process. Phenotypically, patients with ESRD have
an increased susceptibility for both cardiovascular as well as infectious disease
and show a reduction in functional capacity as well as muscular mass
(sarcopenia), translating into a high prevalence of frailty also in younger
patients. Pathophysiologically, the immune dysfunction, telomere attrition and
the presence of low-grade inflammation in uremic patients also show parallels
with the aging process. System models of aging, such as the homeodynamic model
and reliability theory of Gavrilov may also have relevance for ESRD. The
reduction in the redundancy of compensatory mechanisms and the multisystem
impairment in ESRD explain the rapid loss of homeodynamic/homeostatic balance and
the increased susceptibility to external stressors in these patients. System
theories may also explain the relative lack of success of interventions focusing 
on single aspects of renal disease. The concept of accelerated aging, which also 
shares similarities with other organ diseases, may be of relevance both for a
better understanding of the uremic process, as well as for the design of
multidimensional interventions in ESRD patients, including an important role for 
early rehabilitation. Research into processes akin to both aging and uremia may
result in novel therapeutic approaches.

care?

Elderly ESRD patients often lose functionality when they start dialysis, which
may be due to a variety of clinical problems. We recently postulated that
intensive (longer and/or more frequent) hemodialysis (HD) may be the ideal
strategy to try to prevent these ESRD- and dialysis-related complications,
including dialysis-induced hypotension, cardiac and cerebral events,
malnutrition, infections, sleep problems, and psychological issues. The
feasibility of home dialysis therapies has been demonstrated in observational
studies. As self-care dialysis is often a challenge in the elderly patient,
assisted intensive home HD may facilitate the long-term continuation of this
modality. Intensive nursing home HD seems to be an attractive goal for the future
because many elderly ESRD patients reside in an extended care facility.
Combination with rehabilitation and support by social worker and psychologist
remains crucial in the holistic approach toward the elderly ESRD patient. Further
studies are required to test the potential protective effects of intensive HD on 
functionality and quality of life in elderly ESRD patients, and to elucidate the 
mechanisms underlying frailty and other geriatric syndromes in this highly
vulnerable patient population.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the long-term outcomes after
transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in the Multicenter Canadian
Experience study, with special focus on the causes and predictors of late
mortality and valve durability.
BACKGROUND: Very few data exist on the long-term outcomes associated with TAVI.
METHODS: This was a multicenter study including 339 patients considered to be
nonoperable or at very high surgical risk (mean age: 81 ± 8 years; Society of
Thoracic Surgeons score: 9.8 ± 6.4%) who underwent TAVI with a balloon-expandable
Edwards valve (transfemoral: 48%, transapical: 52%). Follow-up was available in
99% of the patients, and serial echocardiographic exams were evaluated in a
central echocardiography core laboratory.
RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 42 ± 15 months 188 patients (55.5%) had died. The
causes of late death (152 patients) were noncardiac (59.2%), cardiac (23.0%), and
unknown (17.8%). The predictors of late mortality were chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53 to
3.11), chronic kidney disease (HR: 1.08 for each decrease of 10 ml/min in
estimated glomerular filtration rate, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.19), chronic atrial
fibrillation (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.03), and frailty (HR: 1.52, 95% CI:
1.07 to 2.17). A mild nonclinically significant decrease in valve area occurred
at 2-year follow-up (p < 0.01), but no further reduction in valve area was
observed up to 4-year follow-up. No changes in residual aortic regurgitation and 
no cases of structural valve failure were observed during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-half of the patients who underwent TAVI because of
a high or prohibitive surgical risk profile had died at a mean follow-up of 3.5
years. Late mortality was due to noncardiac comorbidities in more than one-half
of patients. No clinically significant deterioration in valve function was
observed throughout the follow-up period.

BACKGROUND: Actual tolerability of sunitinib is still poorly documented in
elderly patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Charts of elderly patients treated with sunitinib for mRCC 
were reviewed in six Italian centers to assess safety (primary objective),
efficacy and correlation of toxicity with comprehensive geriatric assessment
(CGA) (secondary objectives).
RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were eligible, and the median age was 74 years. CGA
was carried out in 34 patients (41% fit, 41% vulnerable and 18.5% frail). The
dose reduction to 37.5 mg was made upfront or soon after the first cycle in
69.1%. More frequent toxic effects were fatigue (80.9%), mucositis (61.8%) and
hypertension (58.8%). Cardiac events occurred in nine patients. In 10 patients,
therapy was interrupted early due to rapidly progressive disease (10.3%) or
severe toxicity (4.4%: 1 cardiac failure, 1 fatigue, 1 febrile neutropenia). At a
median follow-up of 27.1 months, the median OS was 18.3 months and the median PFS
was 13.6 months. Correlation was not found between frailty at CGA with severe
toxicity nor with response.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with sunitinib is effective in elderly patients; yet early
interruptions were frequent. Starting treatment at reduced dose and escalating in
the absence of severe toxicity could be suggested.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the impact of frailty in older adults
undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for symptomatic aortic
stenosis.
BACKGROUND: Frailty status impacts prognosis in older adults with heart disease; 
however, the impact of frailty on prognosis after TAVR is unknown.
METHODS: Gait speed, grip strength, serum albumin, and activities of daily living
status were collected at baseline and used to derive a frailty score among
patients who underwent TAVR procedures at a single large-volume institution. The 
cohort was dichotomized on the basis of median frailty score into frail and not
frail groups. The impact of frailty on procedural outcomes (stroke, bleeding,
vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and mortality at 30 days) and 1-year
mortality was evaluated.
RESULTS: Frailty status was assessed in 159 subjects who underwent TAVR (age 86 ±
8 years, Society of Thoracic Surgery Risk Score 12 ± 4). Baseline frailty score
was not associated with conventionally ascertained clinical variables or Society 
of Thoracic Surgery score. Although high frailty score was associated with a
longer post-TAVR hospital stay when compared with lower frailty score (9 ± 6 days
vs. 6 ± 5 days, respectively, p = 0.004), there were no significant crude
associations between frailty status and procedural outcomes, suggesting adequacy 
of the standard selection process for identifying patients at risk for
periprocedural complications after TAVR. Frailty status was independently
associated with increased 1-year mortality (hazard ratio: 3.5, 95% confidence
interval: 1.4 to 8.5, p = 0.007) after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was not associated with increased periprocedural
complications in patients selected as candidates to undergo TAVR but was
associated with increased 1-year mortality after TAVR. Further studies will
evaluate the independent value of this frailty composite in older adults with
aortic stenosis.

BACKGROUND: Recent findings suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be
associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Given the high
prevalence of mild-to-moderate CKD in the general population, in depth analysis
of this association is warranted.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We pooled individual participant data from 5 community-based
cohorts from Europe (second Nord-Trøndelag Health Study [HUNT2], Prevention of
Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease [PREVEND], and the Tromsø study) and the
United States (Atherosclerosis Risks in Communities [ARIC] and Cardiovascular
Health Study [CHS]) to assess the association of estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR), albuminuria, and CKD with objectively verified VTE. To estimate
adjusted hazard ratios for VTE, categorical and continuous spline models were fit
by using Cox regression with shared-frailty or random-effect meta-analysis. A
total of 1178 VTE events occurred over 599 453 person-years follow-up. Relative
to eGFR 100 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), hazard ratios for VTE were 1.29 (95% confidence
interval, 1.04-1.59) for eGFR 75, 1.31 (1.00-1.71) for eGFR 60, 1.82 (1.27-2.60) 
for eGFR 45, and 1.95 (1.26-3.01) for eGFR 30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). In comparison
with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 5.0 mg/g, the hazard ratios for VTE 
were 1.34 (1.04-1.72) for ACR 30 mg/g, 1.60 (1.08-2.36) for ACR 300 mg/g, and
1.92 (1.19-3.09) for ACR 1000 mg/g. There was no interaction between clinical
categories of eGFR and ACR (P=0.20). The adjusted hazard ratio for CKD, defined
as eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or albuminuria ≥30 mg/g, (versus no CKD) was
1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.06). Associations were consistent in
subgroups according to age, sex, and comorbidities, and for unprovoked versus
provoked VTE, as well.
CONCLUSIONS: Both eGFR and ACR are independently associated with increased risk
of VTE in the general population, even across the normal eGFR and ACR ranges.

Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease among older adults: a focus on the oldest 
old.

The National Kidney Foundation (NKF), Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative 
(KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation,
Classification, and Stratification expanded the focus of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) management from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to the entire spectrum of
kidney disease including early kidney damage through the stages of kidney disease
to kidney failure. A consequence of these guidelines is that a large number of
older adults are being identified as having CKD, many of whom will not progress
to ESRD. Concerns have been raised that reduced estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) among older adults may not represent "disease" and using age-specific
cut-points for staging CKD has been proposed. This implies that among older
adults, CKD, as currently defined, may be benign. Several recent studies have
shown that among people greater than or equal to 80 years old, CKD is associated 
with an increased risk for concurrent complications of CKD (eg, anemia, acidosis)
and adverse outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Further, among older adults, CKD is associated with problems not traditionally
thought to be associated with kidney disease. These nondisease-specific outcomes 
include functional decline, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Future research
studies are necessary to determine the impact of concurrent complications of CKD 
and nondisease-specific problems on mortality and functional decline, the
longitudinal trajectories of CKD progression, and patient preferences among the
oldest old with CKD.

'Time and time again': oscillatory and longitudinal time patterns in dialysis
patients.

Oscillatory and longitudinal time patterns play a major role in human physiology.
In chronic hemodialysis patients, abnormalities in both time patterns have been
observed, while time patterns can also influence the response of patients to the 
treatment. Abnormal oscillatory patterns have been observed for ultradian rhythms
(cycle time <20 h), such as an impaired heart rate variability and circadian
rhythms, as reflected by reduced day-night blood pressure differences.
Conversely, the circadian rhythm of body temperature may influence the
hemodynamic tolerance to the dialysis treatment. With regard to infradian (cycle 
time >28 h) rhythms, large seasonal differences in mortality, but also in blood
pressure and interdialytic weight gain, have been observed in dialysis patients. 
The most important longitudinal pattern is the general reduction of life span in 
dialysis patients. One explanation of this phenomenon relates to the concept of
accelerated aging in dialysis patients, for which there are various supportive
arguments. From a phenomenological point of view, this concept translates into
the high prevalence of frailty, even in young dialysis patients. A
multidimensional approach appears necessary to adequately address this problem.
In this review, the relevance of disturbed time patterns in dialysis patients is 
discussed. The changes may reflect an impairment or reduction in
homeostatic/homeodynamic control in dialysis patients and also may have important
prognostic and therapeutic implications.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a physiological vulnerability status of the patient
which is associated with the increased number of hospitalization and death.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of frailty and its associated factors in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on conservative treatment (CT),
hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD).
METHODS: Frailty was assessed in 146 patients (86 CT, 37 HD and 23 PD) and
characterized as muscle weakness and exhaustion--by the physical aspect and
vitality domains, respectively, evaluated in the SF-36 quality of life
instrument; physical inactivity--if he or she answered "never" or "hardly ever"
when asked about physical activity; and as unintentional weight loss (> 4.5 kg
per year). Patients were divided into three groups: non-fragile (NF), pre-fragile
(PF) and fragile (F). The demographic, clinical and laboratory data were
extracted from patient charts.
RESULTS: Frailty was diagnosed in 36% of patients on CT, 37.8% in HD and 47.8% in
PD. It was characterized in 36.8% of patients aged between 20 and 40 years and
40.3% of those between 41 and 60 years. Frailty was significantly associated with
the use of vitamin D (r = 0.16; p = 0.03), hemoglobin (r = -0.14; p = - 0.02) and
intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.16; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is common among patients with CKD on conservative treatment 
and dialysis, even in those who are not elderly. In the patients studied, the
phenotype of frailty was associated with no usage of vitamin D, lower serum
levels of hemoglobin and higher levels of parathyroid hormone.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a construct developed to characterize a state of reduced
functional capacity in older adults. However, there are limited data describing
the prevalence or consequences of frailty in middle-aged patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD).
STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 336 non-dialysis-dependent patients with stages 1-4 CKD
with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (by the
CKD-EPI [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration] serum creatinine-based equation) or
evidence of microalbuminuria enrolled in the Seattle Kidney Study, a clinic-based
cohort study. Findings were compared with community-dwelling older adults in the 
Cardiovascular Health Study.
OUTCOME: Prevalence and determinants of frailty in addition to its association
with the combined outcome of all-cause mortality or renal replacement therapy.
MEASUREMENTS: We defined frailty according to established criteria as 3 or more
of the following characteristics: slow gait, weakness, unintentional weight loss,
exhaustion, and low physical activity. We estimated kidney function using serum
cystatin C concentrations (eGFR(cys)) to minimize confounding due to
relationships of serum creatinine levels with muscle mass and frailty.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 59 years and mean eGFR(cys) was
51 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The prevalence of frailty (14.0%) was twice that of the much
older non-CKD reference population (P < 0.01). The most common frailty components
were physical inactivity and exhaustion. After adjustment including diabetes,
eGFR(cys) categories of <30 and 30-44 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were associated with a
2.8- (95% CI, 1.3-6.3) and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0-4.7)-fold greater prevalence of
frailty compared with GFR(cys) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). There were 63 events during 
a median 987 days of follow-up. After adjustment, the frailty phenotype was
associated with an estimated 2.5 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4)-fold greater risk of death or 
dialysis therapy.
LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional study design obscures inference regarding temporal
relationships between CKD and frailty.
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is relatively common in middle-aged patients with CKD and is
associated with lower eGFR(cys) and increased risk of death or dialysis therapy.

BACKGROUND: In light of the recent trend toward earlier dialysis initiation and
its association with mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease, we
hypothesized that frailty is associated with higher estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis start and may confound the relation between
earlier dialysis initiation and mortality.
METHODS: We examined frailty among participants of the Comprehensive Dialysis
Study (CDS), a special study of the US Renal Data System, which enrolled incident
patients from September 1, 2005, through June 1, 2007. Patients were followed for
vital status through September 30, 2009, and for time to first hospitalization
through December 31, 2008. We used multivariate logistic regression to model the 
association of frailty with eGFR at dialysis start and proportional hazards
regression to assess the outcomes of death or hospitalization.
RESULTS: Among 1576 CDS participants included, the prevalence of frailty was 73%.
In multivariate analysis, higher eGFR at dialysis initiation was associated with 
higher odds of frailty (odds ratio [OR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23-1.68] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < .001). Frailty was independently associated with mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25-1.97]; P < .001) and time to first
hospitalization (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.09-1.45]; P < .001). While higher eGFR at
dialysis initiation was associated with mortality (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.02-1.23]
per 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .02), the association was no longer statistically
significant after frailty was accounted for (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.98-1.19] per 5
mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = .11).
CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is extremely common among patients starting dialysis in the 
United States and is associated with higher eGFR at dialysis initiation.
Recognition of signs and symptoms of frailty by clinicians may prompt earlier
initiation of dialysis and may explain, at least in part, the well-described
association between eGFR at dialysis initiation and mortality.

Patients treated with dialysis have low levels of physical functioning and
activity. Whether this translates into frailty or not may depend on how the
frailty phenotype is operationalized. This is a secondary analysis of data from
the Renal Exercise Demonstration Project to evaluate two methods of
operationalizing the Fried phenotype for frailty: Using measured walking speed
and muscle weakness (FRAILmeas) and using substitution of the Physical Function
Scale (PF) from the SF-36 questionnaire for walking speed and muscle weakness
(FRAILsubst). Complete data for both measures were available for 188 hemodialysis
patients. The frailty score (FRAILmeas) was the sum of criteria scores for
measured gait speed, chair stand, body mass index, vitality, and physical
activity. The frailty score (FRAILsubst) substituted the PF scale score (<75) as 
a surrogate measure for gait speed and for weakness. The frailty score ranged
from 0 to 5. Scores ≥3 were categorized as frail, and <3 as not frail. The
substitution of the PF score for walking speed and muscle weakness resulted in
78% of patients being categorized as frail compared to 24% using actual measured 
walking speed and muscle weakness (P < .001). The component of frailty that had
the highest prevalence was low physical activity (average 54% of subjects).
Frailty (using the FRAILmeas) was higher in patients with increasing age, female 
gender, and lower self-reported PF. Frailty is highly prevalent in hemodialysis
patients; however, measured constructs of the components of frailty should be
used to report the frailty phenotype.

OBJECTIVE: Many older adults have decreased kidney function. Practitioners should
be informed that no single clinical assessment method is validated in predicting 
their kidney function.
DATA SOURCES: Primary literature identified through MEDLINE/PubMed (1950-2010)
and EMBASE (1980-2010) databases. The search was limited to English language,
human subjects, and individuals 65 years of age and older.
STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Research, review articles, and additional
publications related to geriatric, elderly, kidney function assessment, and
cystatin C.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Screening and diagnosing chronic kidney disease are a challenge
in older adults partially because of muscle loss and frailty. The various tools
used to estimate creatinine clearance (Clcr) are not validated and may lead to
under- or overdiagnosis of kidney function. The clinician must be cautious when
using and interpreting results from these values.
RESULTS: Estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with either the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) or Cockcroft-Gault (Clcr) formulae
yielded better predictions of kidney function when compared with creatinine
alone, or to measured Clcr. These estimation methods should be used in clinical
practice to provide a better estimation of kidney function in older adults until 
a more valid assessment tool becomes available.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no proven valid method for eGFR in older adults; however,
the CG and MDRD equations are routinely applied in clinical practice. Kidney
function assessment in older adults remains a challenge, and practitioners should
know their limitations.

The nephro-geriatric unit in a lean-oriented in-hospital model of care.

Nephrologists worldwide are gradually coping with elderly patients. This is
because of the burden of chronic disease in the aging population and specifically
chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD in the elderly rarely occurs in isolation from 
other chronic conditions and can often be a marker of these conditions
themselves. Geriatricians usually take care of chronic conditions and are trained
to perform comprehensive geriatric assessment, a tool to estimate frailty, that
is the risk of adverse outcome, disability, and death in the clinical setting of 
elderly inpatients. Unfortunately, they are not used to a CHD invasive and
non-invasive approach and so there is no doubt about the need for a co-managed
care model for these patients. However, where and how this model must be realized
is still questionable. New hospital care models are patient-centered and
encompass the concepts of departments to embrace the differentiated levels of
care approach. According to this model the hospital is subdivided into three
different standards of care: 1-high; 2 -intermediate; 3- low and this
organization avoids inpatients being transferred frequently to different units,
receiving specific care easily obtained by moving and changing the medical staff 
in charge of the patient. The lean care approach integrates the principles of the
Toyota Producing System (TPS), a leading system of the industrial world, into
intensity-based hospital care, thereby maximizing quality processes and promoting
co-managed care as in the nephro-geriatric clinical setting.

A smoothing expectation and substitution algorithm for the semiparametric
accelerated failure time frailty model.

This paper proposes an estimation procedure for the semiparametric accelerated
failure time frailty model that combines smoothing with an Expectation and
Maximization-like algorithm for estimating equations. The resulting algorithm
permits simultaneous estimation of the regression parameter, the baseline
cumulative hazard, and the parameter indexing a general frailty distribution. We 
develop novel moment-based estimators for the frailty parameter, including a
generalized method of moments estimator. Standard error estimates for all
parameters are easily obtained using a randomly weighted bootstrap procedure. For
the commonly used gamma frailty distribution, the proposed algorithm is very easy
to implement using widely available numerical methods. Simulation results
demonstrate that the algorithm performs very well in this setting. We re-analyz
several previously analyzed data sets for illustrative purposes.

Subtle changes in renal function are associated with differences in late survival
following adult cardiac surgery.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the predictors of post-operative renal function
following adult cardiac surgery, and to assess the influence of this on late
survival.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data were analysed on 8032 patients who
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery or combined procedures
from 1 January 1998 until 31 December 2008, who did not require preoperative
renal replacement therapy. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was
calculated by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula accounting for
ethnicity pre-operatively, post-operatively on the fourth post-operative day, and
the post-operative nadir based upon the peak post-operative creatinine within 30 
days of surgery. Late survival data were obtained from the UK Central Cardiac
Audit Database (CCAD). Appropriate frailty analyses were conducted in R and model
fit was compared using Aikaike's Information Criterion. Initial analysis intended
to determine predictors of post-operative renal function including pre-operative 
eGFR, EuroSCORE and surgical procedure including the operative procedure and
bypass time. Further analysis examined its influence on late survival.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 72 months (IQR 48-105) during which there were 904 
late deaths. The most powerful predictor of the day 4 eGFR was the pre-operative 
eGFR but other factors contributed including increasing EuroSCORE and bypass
time. The pre-operative eGFR was shown to be a strong and independent predictor
of late outcome (P = 0.0001, HR 0.497 95%CI 0.434-564); however, model fit was
significantly improved using the day 4 eGFR (P = 0.0001, HR 0.43 95%CI
0.385-0.482). No specific change in individual renal function was identified as a
predictor of adverse late survival, and neither the pre-operative nor day 4 eGFR 
was predictive of the nadir of renal function.
CONCLUSIONS: Subtle early changes in renal function at the time of surgery are
powerful predictors of adverse late outcome and can be predicted by pre-operative
renal function.

The population is getting older. Rehabilitation can play an essential strategic
role to counteract impairments and disability which characterize the elderly.
Correct rehabilitative programmes have to be approached on the functional
limitation and residual abilities of elders. Leading a more active lifestyle and 
regular physical activity including aerobic and resistance exercises have been
demonstrated to improve cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and
cognitive wellbeing in older adults. Occupational therapy, prescription of
assistive devices, environmental, and home living adaptation, and family or
caregiver educational training represent an essential rehabilitative strategy in 
elders developing disability. In these people, falls are dramatic events that
lead to hospitalization, functional decline, decreased social activity, and poor 
quality of life. Rehabilitation incorporating balance, gait, and strength
training exercise interventions can reduce the risk of falls. Frailty refers to a
condition characterized by a gradual physiologic decline in multiple body
systems, loss of physiologic reserve, and increased vulnerability to disease and 
death. Several therapeutic strategies have been proposed including exercises,
multi-component training and approaches, all aimed at decreasing the need for
nursing home placement, hospitalization, and reducing dependence and death. In
these subjects, geriatric comprehensive assessment and the multi-disciplinary
team have recently been demonstrated to be more effective than usual care.

BACKGROUND: Organ dysfunctions and medical complications, such as renal failure, 
liver impairment, coagulation disorders, cardiovascular and respiratory
illnesses, may hamper an adequate pain management in haematological patients.
AIM: To summarize current knowledge on pain management in hematological patients 
presenting major organ dysfunctions and comorbidity. We also attempted to provide
recommendations to optimize analgesia and to minimize side effects in the setting
of medically compromised and frail haematological patients.
METHODS: A systematic search of the literature, using relevant key words, was
conducted in PubMed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Pain in hematological patients is a common symptom and
is often multi-factorial. Most pharmacotherapeutic measures, including causal
therapies, analgesics and adjuvant agents routinely applied in pain management,
may also be used in the setting of clinical frailty and medical comorbidities;
however, comprehensive clinical and functional patient's evaluations and a
careful consideration of expected benefits and potential adverse events are
required.

The ability to predict outcomes following a kidney transplant is limited by the
complex physiologic decline of kidney failure, a latent factor that is difficult 
to capture using conventional comorbidity assessment. The frailty phenotype is a 
recently described inflammatory state of increased vulnerability to stressors
resulting from decreased physiologic reserve and dysregulation of multiple
physiologic systems. We hypothesized that frailty would be associated with
delayed graft function, based on putative associations between inflammatory
cytokines and graft dysfunction. We prospectively measured frailty in 183 kidney 
transplant recipients between December 2008 and April 2010. Independent
associations between frailty and delayed graft function were analyzed using
modified Poisson regression. Preoperative frailty was independently associated
with a 1.94-fold increased risk for delayed graft function (95% CI, 1.13-3.36; P 
= .02). The assessment of frailty may provide further insights into the
pathophysiology of allograft dysfunction and may improve our ability to
preoperatively risk-stratify kidney transplant recipients.

Risk of herpes zoster in patients treated with long-term hemodialysis: a matched 
cohort study.

Memorial Hospital, Taiwan.

BACKGROUND: The risk of herpes zoster in the dialysis population relative to the 
general population is not known. The aim of this study was to perform a
population-based cohort study to investigate the risk of herpes zoster after the 
initiation of hemodialysis therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease
(ESRD) in Taiwan, a country with the highest incidence of ESRD in the world.
STUDY DESIGN: Matched cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health
Insurance Research Database. 843 patients who were beginning hemodialysis therapy
in 1999-2003 were included as the study cohort and 3,372 patients without ESRD
matched for age and sex were included as a comparison cohort. A multivariate
frailty Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to adjust for
confounding and compare the 6-year herpes zoster-free survival rate between these
2 cohorts.
PREDICTORS: Hemodialysis.
OUTCOMES: Herpes zoster.
RESULTS: Mean years of follow-up were 4.73 and 5.49 for the hemodialysis and
comparison cohorts, respectively. 868 patients developed herpes zoster throughout
the study period, 294 from the hemodialysis cohort and 574 from the comparison
cohort. The incidence rate of herpes zoster (73.34 events/1,000 person-year) was 
significantly higher in the hemodialysis cohort than in the control cohort (31.03
events/1,000 person-years). After adjusting for potential confounders, the
adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.98 (95% CI, 1.72-2.27).
LIMITATIONS: We expect that some patients with mild zoster chose not to seek
medical help.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that patients treated with long-term hemodialysis are at
an increased risk of herpes zoster compared with the general population.

BACKGROUND: The increased incidence of cancer in dialysis patients has been
discussed since the mid-70s. Consequently, oncologists, nephrologists and
pharmacists are increasingly facing challenging situations of cytotoxic drug
handling in dialysis patients. In dialysis patients, two main issues must be
considered. First, renal function of hemodialysis (HD) patients is no longer
functional. Therefore, these patients may necessitate drug dosage reduction,
namely drug prescription, must be cautiously checked before administration with
appropriate dosage adjustment whenever necessary to ensure efficacy while
avoiding overdosage and related side effects. Secondly, drug clearance by
dialysis must be taken into account for appropriate chemotherapy timing in order 
to avoid drug removal, which may result in a loss of efficacy.
METHODS: We reviewed the international literature on the pharmacokinetics,
efficacy, tolerance and dosage adjustment of anticancer drugs used on
hemodialysis cancer patients, using the key words: kidney, renal, dialysis,
hemodialysis, end-stage renal disease and the name of each drug.
RESULTS: Only case reports and small series were found. 57.1% of the drugs need
dosage adjustment and 64.3% should be administered after the dialysis session.
CONCLUSION: Cancer treatment in feasible in dialysis patients. Some drugs require
dosage adaptation while others can be given as in patients with normal kidney
function. These patients need coordinated care between oncologists, nephrologists
and pharmacists to optimize drug delivery and logistics. Frailty scores, like in 
oncogeriatrics, should be built to optimally adapt cancer treatments in these
dialysis patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hispanics are the largest minority in the United
States (comprising 16.3% of the US population) and have 1.5 times the age-, sex-,
and race-adjusted incidence of ESRD compared with non-Hispanics. Poor health care
access and low-quality care generally received by Hispanics are well documented. 
However, little is known regarding dialysis preparation of Hispanic patients with
progressive CKD.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Using data from Medical Evidence
Report form CMS-2728-U3, 321,996 adult patients of white or black race were
identified who initiated hemodialysis (HD) between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 
2008. The form captures Hispanic ethnicity, vascular access use at first
outpatient HD, sociodemographic characteristics, and comorbidities. This study
also examined whether use of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG) was
reported.
RESULTS: AVF/AVG use was reported in 14.5% of Hispanics and 17.6% in
non-Hispanics (P<0.001). The unadjusted prevalence ratio (PR) was 0.85 (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 0.83-0.88), indicating that Hispanics were 15% less
likely to use AVG/AVF for their first outpatient HD. Adjustment for age, sex, and
race, as well as a large number of comorbidities and frailty indicators, did not 
change this association (PR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.83-0.88). Further adjustment for
timing of first predialysis nephrology care, however, attenuated the PR by
two-thirds (PR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Hispanics are less likely to use arteriovenous access for first
outpatient HD compared with non-Hispanics, which seems to be explained by
variation in the access to predialysis nephrology care.

The "no dialysis" option.

Cicely Saunders Institute, UK.

Increasing numbers of patients are starting dialysis who have limited prognoses
for 6-month survival. The presence of multiple comorbidities, aging, and frailty 
contributes to this phenomenon. The rate of dialysis withdrawal has been
accelerating over the past decade, and this calls into question the condition of 
patients who are initiating dialysis. One option is to consider and discuss the
"no dialysis" option with patients and family. Patients need to be identified who
may benefit from this option, and their medical management needs to be reviewed.

BACKGROUND: For chronic hemodialysis, the ideal permanent vascular access is the 
arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Temporary catheters should be reserved for acute
dialysis needs. The AVF is associated with lower infection rates, better clinical
results, and a higher quality of life and survival when compared to temporary
catheters. In Brazil, the proportion of patients with temporary catheters for
more than 3 months from the beginning of therapy is used as an evaluation of the 
quality of renal units. The aim of this study is to evaluate factors associated
with the time between the beginning of hemodialysis with temporary catheters and 
the placement of the first arteriovenous fistula in Brazil.
METHODS: This is an observational, prospective non-concurrent study using
national administrative registries of all patients financed by the public health 
system who began renal replacement therapy (RRT) between 2000 and 2004 in Brazil.
Incident patients were eligible who had hemodialysis for the first time. Patients
were excluded who: had hemodialysis reportedly started after the date of death
(inconsistent database); were younger than 18 years old; had HIV; had no record
of the first dialysis unit; and were dialyzed in units with less than twenty
patients. To evaluate individual and renal unit factors associated with the event
of interest, the frailty model was used (N = 55,589).
RESULTS: Among the 23,824 patients (42.9%) who underwent fistula placement in the
period of the study, 18.2% maintained the temporary catheter for more than three 
months until the fistula creation. The analysis identified five statistically
significant factors associated with longer time until first fistula: higher age
(Hazard-risk - HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00); having hypertension and cardiovascular
diseases (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.98) as the cause of chronic renal disease;
residing in capitals cities (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.9-0.95) and certain regions in
Brazil - South (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.8-0.87), Midwest (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94),
Northeast (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.88-0.94), or North (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94) and
the type of renal unit (public or private).
CONCLUSION: Monitoring the provision of arteriovenous fistulas in renal units
could improve the care given to patients with end stage renal disease.

PURPOSE: Hydration and urinary alkalinization are essential for reducing renal
dysfunction with high dose methotrexate (HDMTX). This report presents an analysis
of institutional methods used to achieve adequate urinary alkalinization and
output for patients receiving single agent HDMTX. Renal and metabolic parameters 
of tolerance were examined.
METHODS: Medical records of adult patients receiving HDMTX during the calendar
years of 2008-2009 were retrospectively reviewed to determine the time to achieve
urine pH > 7. Number of hospital days, bicarbonate dose, ordered hydration rate, 
urine output, and urine pH were assessed. A survival analysis model was run for
time to urine pH > 7 using preadmission oral bicarbonate as a predictor variable 
and including a frailty term. Observational statistics were performed for other
parameters.
RESULTS: The analysis included 79 encounters for ten patients. Urine pH > 7 was
achieved more rapidly in patients receiving preadmission oral bicarbonate
(P = 0.012). The number of patients receiving HDMTX on the same day as admission 
was greater for those receiving preadmission oral bicarbonate (47%) in comparison
to those who did not (2%), and they spent less time in the hospital. A standard
regimen for hydration and urinary alkalinization based on this project is
reported. The nature and frequency of adverse events were as expected for this
treatment.
CONCLUSION: At our institution, the time to achieve urinary alkalinization was
reduced for patients receiving preadmission oral bicarbonate which facilitated
chemotherapy infusion on the same day as admission and decreased the number of
calendar days that patients stayed in the hospital.

Older patients on dialysis have unique needs and characteristics and their
outcomes vary from that of their younger counterparts. Comparatively fewer will
start or be maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to younger patients, 
despite the fact that hemodialysis is often poorly tolerated. Barriers to PD for 
older patients include poor vision, frailty, cognitive dysfunction, accommodation
issues, and a bias from renal teams that older patients cannot do PD. The
development of assisted PD can overcome many of these barriers. The ability of
older patients to use PD as their dialysis modality should not be determined by
whether they live in an area where the nephrologist is a PD enthusiast. All
patients should be given nonbiased information so they can choose the dialysis
modality that gives them the best quality of life and suits their and their
family's lifestyle.

Recent publications not only underline the risks of age and disease during
surgery but also help us quantify the risks with greater precision. Importantly, 
patient factors often have a stronger association with postoperative mortality
than surgical factors. Important factors preoperatively are: age, American
Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) physical status, emergency surgery, and plasma
albumin concentration. There is emerging work on quantifying frailty as a further
risk factor for perioperative complication and mortality as well as need for
higher level of care after discharge from hospital. Important postoperative
complications include sepsis and kidney injury. Preventing, detecting and
managing complications and mortality is the greatest challenge facing those
caring for surgical patients, including anaesthetists. Evidence for the long term
effects of perioperative complications adds further importance to minimizing
perioperative complications. Newer approaches in patient care, particularly
co-management during the postoperative phase by different specialities are
emerging. Managing high-risk patients should also be enhanced with greater
surveillance and more rapid and appropriate response; ensuring we do not fail to 
rescue our patients.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether disease burden is associated with frailty
independent of diagnosed chronic disease and whether physiological measurements
provide greater understanding of the etiology of frailty.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand four hundred thirty-seven participants in the
Cardiovascular Health Study, 1992/93 examination (mean age 74.8 ± 4.8, 43.4%
male, 95.8% white).
MEASUREMENTS: Disease burden and frailty were tabulated using 10-point scales (0 
= healthy, 10 = unhealthy). Disease burden was the sum of measurements
characterizing the vasculature, brain, kidneys, lungs, and glucose metabolism.
Frailty was assessed using the frailty index reported by Fried. Multivariate
linear models were used to determine the association between disease burden
(predictor) and frailty (outcome).
RESULTS: Unadjusted, 1-point-higher disease burden was associated with a
0.28-point-higher frailty score (P < .001). White matter grade, forced vital
capacity, and cystatin-C were particularly strongly and significantly associated 
with frailty. Disease burden attenuated the association between frailty and age
by 29%, and disease burden and age had similar associations with frailty. Disease
burden attenuated the association between frailty and fibrinogen, Factor VIII,
and C-reactive protein by 32%, 56%, and 83%, respectively. Frailty was associated
with diagnosed depression, stroke, cognitive impairment, arthritis, and pulmonary
disease but not coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or kidney disease in
the presence of a summary of disease burden. In the adjusted model, disease
burden remained significantly associated with frailty (β = 0.11, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Disease burden was independently and significantly associated with
frailty. These results emphasize that typically unrecognized physiological
changes may contribute significantly to frailty.

Epidemiology and management of end-stage renal disease in the elderly.

Elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk of
developing aging-related problems, such as frailty, impaired physical function,
falls, poor nutrition and cognitive impairment. These factors affect dialysis
outcomes, which can be very poor in frail, elderly patients who often experience 
a decline in overall health and physical function and have short survival. The
default treatment option for these patients is hospital-based hemodialysis, often
with little consideration of how this modality will affect the survival or
quality of life of individual patients. A comparison of quality of life of
elderly patients on hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis shows that those on
peritoneal dialysis have less illness intrusion. Assisted peritoneal dialysis
enables a greater number of frail, elderly patients to have dialysis in their own
homes. Dialysis may not extend survival for those with multiple comorbidities, so
conservative care (nondialysis treatment) should be considered. To improve the
outcomes of elderly patients with ESRD, it is necessary to develop a realistic
approach to overall prognosis, quality of life and how the patient copes with the
disabilities associated with aging. This approach includes having discussions
regarding choice of treatment and end-of-life goals with patients and families.

The numbers of older patients requiring dialysis therapy is rising, reflecting
the ageing of the general population. Older dialysis patients have a tendency to 
present later for dialysis, have a higher number of comorbid conditions, are at
higher risk of cognitive dysfunction and have increased levels of frailty. These 
are all barriers to home dialysis therapy so hospital haemodialysis (HD) is the
predominant dialysis modality for older patients. Evidence suggests, however,
that home treatment with peritoneal dialysis (PD) intrudes less into the life of 
older patients than hospital HD. Assisted PD is available in some countries and
this enables more older patients to be treated in their own homes. Adjustments to
patient education also need to be made to accommodate the barriers to learning
and decision-making that often exist in older people.

Frailty is associated with a pro-inflammatory state, which has been characterized
by elevated levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers, but has not been related 
to the number of co-existing chronic diseases associated with inflammation. We
sought to determine the extent to which a higher number of inflammatory-related
diseases is associated with frailty and to identify the most common disease
patterns associated with being frail in older adults. We performed binomial
regression analyses to assess whether a higher count of inflammatory-related
diseases increases the probability of frailty using data from the WHAS I and II, 
companion cohorts composed of 70-79-year-old community-dwelling older women in
Baltimore, Maryland (n=620). An increase of one inflammatory-related disease was 
associated log-linearly with frailty (Prevalence Ratio (PR)=2.28, 95% Confidence 
Interval (CI)=1.81-2.87). After adjusting for age, race, education, and smoking
status, the probability of frailty remained significant (PR=1.97,
95%CI=1.52-2.55). In the frail population, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
depressive symptoms (Prevalence=22.9%, 95%CI=14.2-34.8%); CVD and depressive
symptoms (21.7%, 95%CI=13.2-33.5%); CKD and anemia (18.7%, 95%CI=11.1-29.7%);
cardiovascular disease (CVD), CKD, and pulmonary disease (10.7%,
95%CI=5.2-21.0%); CKD, anemia, and depressive symptoms (8.7%, 95%CI=3.9-18.2%);
and CVD, anemia, pulmonary disease, and depressive symptoms (5.0%,
95%CI=1.6-14.4%) were among the most frequent disease combinations. Their
prevalence percentages were significantly higher in the frail versus non-frail
women. A higher inflammatory-related disease count, perhaps reflecting a greater 
pro-inflammatory burden, increases the likelihood of frailty. Shared mechanisms
among specific disease combinations may further contribute to this risk.

INTRODUCTION: Many transplant studies in elderly patients focus on survival and
mortality rates. It was the aim of this review to evaluate publications dealing
with individual patient performance and independence.
METHODS: The literature search included all articles retrievable for the hit
"transplantation in elderly recipients" between 1960 and 2010. For quality search
the inclusion criteria were as follows: older than 60 years and transplanted
kidney, liver, heart, lung or pancreas from a deceased or living donor. We
focussed on parameters concerning quality of life, frailty, nutritional
status/weight loss, drugs/interactions/polypharmacy, gait/osteoporosis/fracture, 
delirium/dementia and geriatric assessment to address physical and psychosocial
functionality of elderly recipients.
RESULTS: The initial hit list contained 1427 citations from electronic databases.
249 abstracts thereof were selected for full review. A total of 60 articles met
final inclusion criteria. Finally, only five studies met the qualitative
inclusion criteria as listed above.
CONCLUSION: The number of elderly patients placed on waiting lists has increased 
dramatically and will further grow. Interdisciplinary collaboration and distinct 
patient selection is recommended in most of the studies. However, data concerning
quality of life and related parameters in elderly transplant recipients are rare.

BACKGROUND: In the general population, frailty, a late stage of the aging
process, predicts mortality. We investigated whether manifesting a previously
defined frailty-related phenotype (FRP) before initiating highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) affects the likelihood of developing clinical AIDS
or mortality after HAART initiation.
METHODS: Among 596 HIV-infected men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study whose
date of HAART initiation was known within ±6 months and who had an assessable FRP
status within 3 years before HAART, survival analyses were performed to assess
the effect of FRP manifestation on clinical AIDS or death after HAART.
RESULTS: In men free of AIDS before HAART, AIDS or death after HAART occurred in 
13/36 (36%) men who exhibited the FRP before HAART but only in 69/436 (16%) men
who did not (hazard ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.4-4.6; p < .01).
After adjusting for age, ethnicity, education, nadir CD4+ T-cell count, peak HIV 
viral load, and hemoglobin in the 3 years before HAART, having the FRP at >25% of
visits in the 3 years before HAART significantly predicted AIDS or death
(adjusted hazard ratio = 3.8; 95% confidence interval = 1.9-7.9; p < .01).
Results were unchanged when the analysis was restricted to the 335 AIDS-free men 
who were HAART responders, to the 124 men who had AIDS at HAART initiation, or to
the subsets of men for whom indices of liver and kidney function could be taken
into account.
CONCLUSION: Having a persistent frailty-like phenotype before HAART initiation
predicted a worse prognosis after HAART, independent of known risk factors.

BACKGROUND: Twenty-five to 30% of new renal replacement therapy (RRT) patients
present late to renal services. The proportion in whom this is avoidable, and
whether awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has reduced its incidence is
not known.
METHODS: Adult patients starting RRT (2003-2008) in a single unit were grouped
according to the time interval between first presentation to the unit and start
of RRT: <90 days (late presenters); 90-364 days; ≥ 365 days. 'Late presenters'
were classified as follows: acute kidney injury--patients who had acute but
irreversible renal failure; 'avoidable' late referrals, if they had known
pre-existing CKD and 'unavoidable' late referrals, if they had unpredictable
rapid progression of their CKD or had no prior contact with health care.
Mortality risk associated with late presentation was explored using multivariable
Cox regression.
RESULTS: Late presentation was common (24.3%) but late referrals accounted for
only 7.4% and 3.9% were avoidable. The incidence of late referrals decreased from
9.2% in 2003-2005 to 5.5% in 2006-2008 (trend P = 0.07). Late presentation was
associated with increased mortality after adjusting for comorbidity,
transplantation and permanent vascular access, and the majority of late
presenters died due to malignancy or withdrawal of RRT.
CONCLUSIONS: The lower incidence of late referrals and the falling trend could be
due to implementation of automated estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting
and the increased awareness of CKD in primary care. Future prospective studies
are needed to examine the extent to which frailty contributes to this mortality
risk.

Often, one gathers together under the denomination "peritoneal dialysis" patients
with various clinical profiles. To quantify this "heterogeneity" we analysed the 
clinical characteristics of 32,975 patients treated by dialysis at 31 December
2008 in 22 French regions, participating to the REIN registry. This
cross-sectional study confirms our initial hypothesis of a great heterogeneity of
patients' profiles in peritoneal dialysis. As in hemodialysis, there is a
gradation between modalities: from assisted continuous ambulatory peritoneal
dialysis which concerns the frailty patients to autonomous automated peritoneal
dialysis for more healthy patients, through assisted automated peritoneal
dialysis and autonomous continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.

AIMS: Frailty, a syndrome of decreased physiological reserve that is prevalent in
old age, impacts on clinical pharmacology. The aims of the study were to (1)
determine whether frailty affects the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin and (2)
assess the accuracy of different estimates of body size and renal clearance as
estimates of gentamicin pharmacokinetics in older inpatients.
METHODS: This was an observational study of gentamicin pharmacokinetics in a
cohort of Australian hospital inpatients aged ≥65 years, who were administered
prophylactic intravenous gentamicin.
RESULTS: Of the 31 participants, 14 were frail and 17 non frail on the Reported
Edmonton Frail Scale. The mean volume of distribution of gentamicin was 14.8 ±
1.4 l in frail participants and 15.3 ± 2.2 l in non frail (NS). Volume of
distribution correlated best with lean bodyweight. Gentamicin clearance was
significantly lower in frail participants (46.6 ± 10.7 ml min(-1)) than in non
frail (58.2 ± 12.4 ml min(-1), P=0.01). The Cockcroft Gault estimate of
creatinine clearance calculated using ideal bodyweight gave the best estimate of 
gentamicin clearance (mean error -0.15 ml min(-1), 95% CI -2.67, 2.39). The
Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance calculated using actual bodyweight and the
estimated glomerular filtration rate from the modified diet in renal disease
equation overestimated gentamicin clearance, with mean errors of -10.15 ml
min(-1) (95%CI -13.60, -6.71) and -18.86 ml min(-1) (95% CI -22.45, -15.27),
respectively. The Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance calculated using lean
bodyweight underestimated gentamicin clearance (mean error 6.54 ml min(-1), 95%
CI 4.18, 8.90).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail older people have significantly lower gentamicin clearance
than non frail. The best estimate of gentamicin clearance is obtained from the
Cockcroft Gault creatinine clearance calculated using ideal bodyweight.

Quality of life is particularly important for older patients with end-stage
kidney disease, particularly when likely survival is short because of the burden 
of comorbidities. The features of old age and frailty make it difficult to cope
with both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Evidence exists that quality of
life is better on peritoneal dialysis compared with hemodialysis, yet the
majority of older patients are placed on hemodialysis. Older patients should
therefore receive appropriate education to enable choice of the appropriate
dialysis modality for their lifestyle. The development of assisted peritoneal
dialysis will enable those who cannot perform their own dialysis to have their
treatment at home. Delaying dialysis to a time when it is actually needed and
discussing the option of conservative care will also improve the quality of the
end-of-life phase for patients with multiple comorbidities and with a poor
overall prognosis.

UK.

Following the expansion of dialysis services for patients with chronic kidney
disease, an increasing number of elderly patients with varying degrees of frailty
and additional comorbidities have been offered treatment. Life expectancy is
somewhat limited in this group of patients, and initiation of dialysis may not
necessarily improve quality of life. As such, an increasing number of centers are
offering conservative care for patients who have made an informed decision not to
have dialysis. As conservative care includes active treatment of anemia, volume
overload, blood pressure control, and management of uremic symptoms, including
pruritus, we term this approach as maximal conservative management of chronic
kidney disease. We describe our experience of maximum conservative management,
which although may not prolong life, can maintain the quality of life and
functional ability until the final illness in the majority of patients. Although 
these patients do not go to the hospital on a regular basis, coordinated support 
from the hospital, the community, and the care giver/relative is required for
successful care of the patient. Appropriate end of life planning can then be made
according to the wishes of the patient.

Physical inactivity contributes to the frailty and the decline in function that
develops over time among patients with end-stage renal disease. We assessed
physical activity among 1547 ambulatory patients new to dialysis in the United
States Renal Data System Comprehensive Dialysis Study. We used a self-reporting
Human Activity Profile that included Maximal and Adjusted Activity Scores and
compared results to established norms by age and gender. Physical activity was
found to be extremely low with scores for all age and gender categories below the
5th percentile of healthy individuals and 95% of patients had scores consonant
with low fitness. Older age, female gender, diabetes, atherosclerotic disease,
and a low level of education were associated with lower activity scores assessed 
by univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis. Higher serum albumin,
creatinine, and lower body mass index, but not hemoglobin levels, were associated
with greater physical activity. By multivariable analysis, patients on
hemodialysis using a catheter reported lower levels of physical activity compared
to those on peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis using an arteriovenous fistula, or 
with a graft. Lower Maximal and Adjusted Activity Scores were associated with
poor physical function and mental health. Hence, physical activity is
distressingly low among patients new to dialysis. Thus, strategies to enhance
activity in these patients should be explored.

Thyroid hormone abnormalities and frailty in elderly patients with chronic kidney
disease: a hypothesis.

Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in the metabolic activities of adults,
affecting almost every organ system. All types of thyroid diseases are
encountered in the elderly. As symptoms and signs of thyroid diseases may overlap
with what is considered to be "normal aging," the presence of a thyroid disorder 
may go undiagnosed in the elderly. This potential problem is further compounded
in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the presence of an
underlying hormonal problem such as hypothyroidism may be erroneously attributed 
to multiple comorbidities, the aging process, or the kidney disease. Frailty is
being recognized as a contributing factor to the poor outcomes (hospitalization
and high mortality) in elderly patients with CKD. Predisposing factors leading to
frailty in elderly with CKD such as increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low
testosterone, sarcopenia, and depression are associated with thyroid hormonal
abnormalities. These associations are remarkable and raise the question of
whether routine monitoring and screening for thyroid hormone changes in elderly
CKD patients might be helpful in identifying reversible causes of frailty. In
this review, we will focus on the associations between thyroid hormone
abnormalities and the predisposing factors of frailty in elderly patients with
CKD. If a cause-effect relationship of thyroid hormone abnormalities and factors 
predisposing to frailty in CKD patients is established, identification and
treatment of thyroid abnormalities in this population would assume increased
importance.

Summary In this article, we propose a positive stable shared frailty Cox model
for clustered failure time data where the frailty distribution varies with
cluster-level covariates. The proposed model accounts for covariate-dependent
intracluster correlation and permits both conditional and marginal inferences. We
obtain marginal inference directly from a marginal model, then use a stratified
Cox-type pseudo-partial likelihood approach to estimate the regression
coefficient for the frailty parameter. The proposed estimators are consistent and
asymptotically normal and a consistent estimator of the covariance matrix is
provided. Simulation studies show that the proposed estimation procedure is
appropriate for practical use with a realistic number of clusters. Finally, we
present an application of the proposed method to kidney transplantation data from
the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.

During the last decade, a significant body of evidence has accumulated,
indicating that the declining activity of the GH-IGF-I axis with aging might play
a role in the development of frailty and in several pathological conditions
commonly seen during aging, such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and 
cognitive decline. GH therapy has become widely popular as antiaging therapy in
order to counteract the age-related decline in muscle mass and strength and the
increase in fat mass. However there are only few proven beneficial effects of GH 
therapy in healthy elderly subjects and its use remains highly controversial in
the scientific community. In this paper we will review the current evidence
related to the use of GH and/or GH-secretagogues in normal and pathological
aging.

Nephrologists care for an increasing number of elderly patients on hemodialysis. 
As such, an understanding of the overlap among complications of hemodialysis and 
geriatric syndromes is crucial. This article reviews hemodialysis management
issues including vascular access, hypertension, anemia and bone and mineral
disorders with an attention towards the distinct medical needs of the elderly.
Key concepts of geriatrics frailty, dementia and palliative care are also
discussed, as nephrologists frequently participate in decision-making directed
toward balancing longevity, functional status and the burden of therapy.

Dialysis management is changing over time due to the changing dialysis
population, with many overlapping issues between gerontological and nephrological
care. The conditions that are focused on in this review are frailty, cognitive
impairment, depression and changes in body composition. These factors should be
considered when managing older patients on dialysis.

Administrative data suggest familiar socioeconomic, race, sex, and age
disparities in renal patients' receipt of services such as cardiac
rehabilitation. Dialysis facility characteristics and disparities in access to
transplantation, home-based dialysis, and more frequent dialysis also may
influence patients' access to rehabilitation opportunities. Tested models exist
for interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation, exercise/physical conditioning
programs, and psychosocial interventions, and several of these programs consider 
the special needs of particular age groups. Recognition of the importance of
physical activity/exercise and depressed mood as predictors of patient outcomes, 
and research addressing the concept of frailty, effectively may increase the
salience of rehabilitation objectives throughout the renal community.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the acute and late outcomes
of a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) program including both the
transfemoral (TF) and transapical (TA) approaches; and 2) to determine the
results of TAVI in patients deemed inoperable because of either porcelain aorta
or frailty.
BACKGROUND: Very few data exist on the results of a comprehensive TAVI program
including both TA and TF approaches for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis
in patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent TAVI with the Edwards valve (Edwards 
Lifesciences, Inc., Irvine, California) between January 2005 and June 2009 in 6
Canadian centers were included.
RESULTS: A total of 345 procedures (TF: 168, TA: 177) were performed in 339
patients. The predicted surgical mortality (Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk
score) was 9.8 +/- 6.4%. The procedural success rate was 93.3%, and 30-day
mortality was 10.4% (TF: 9.5%, TA: 11.3%). After a median follow-up of 8 months
(25th to 75th interquartile range: 3 to 14 months) the mortality rate was 22.1%. 
The predictors of cumulative late mortality were peri-procedural sepsis (hazard
ratio [HR]: 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48 to 8.28) or need for
hemodynamic support (HR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.11 to 6), pulmonary hypertension (PH)
(HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17 to 3), chronic kidney disease (CKD) (HR: 2.30, 95% CI:
1.38 to 3.84), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR: 1.75, 95%
CI: 1.09 to 2.83). Patients with either porcelain aorta (18%) or frailty (25%)
exhibited acute outcomes similar to the rest of the study population, and
porcelain aorta patients tended to have a better survival rate at 1-year
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: A TAVI program including both TF and TA approaches was associated
with comparable mortality as predicted by surgical risk calculators for the
treatment of patients at very high or prohibitive surgical risk, including
porcelain aorta and frail patients. Baseline (PH, COPD, CKD) and peri-procedural 
(hemodynamic support, sepsis) factors but not the approach determined worse
outcomes.

Specific laboratory tests and physical findings are available to the practicing
clinician that should raise the suspicion of inflammation. Inflammation is
related to specific clinical outcomes. Once identified, changes in clinical
practice may affect the level of inflammation in individual and or groups of
dialysis patients with the hope that these changes may in turn affect outcome in 
a positive manner. Standard clinical tests and observations associated with
inflammation are hypoalbuminemia, erythropoietin resistance, decreased iron
saturation accompanied by high ferritin, frailty, low serum creatinine, reduced
total and LDL-cholesterol, and increased C reactive protein (CRP). Inflammation
is strongly associated with loss of physical function, dyslipidemia (low LDL- and
HDL-cholesterol, increased triglycerides), and anemia that is unresponsive to
erythropoietin. Inflammation is associated with cardiovascular events, increased 
hospitalization, and death. Correctible causes of inflammation are tunneled
dialysis catheters, arteriovenous grafts, catheter infection, periodontal
disease, poor water quality, and dialyzer incompatibility. Obesity also is a
source of cytokines but may be less amenable to treatment. Inflammation is
multifactorial in dialysis patients. Some sources are recognizable and
correctable, such as vascular access type, clinical infection, and water quality,
and some are not. Inflammation is strongly associated with outcome.

Health-related quality of life outcomes in chronic kidney disease.

Pennsylvania 15213, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) endure compromised 
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although the link between HRQOL and
increased mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is well
documented, less is known about the relationship between CKD and HRQOL. This
article reviews the recent evidence on HRQOL, its correlates and proposed
intervention strategies to improve HRQOL in CKD.
RECENT FINDINGS: A growing body of literature indicates that various comorbid
conditions related to CKD play a substantial role in impaired HRQOL in CKD.
Hypertension, both a cause and complication of CKD, negatively affects HRQOL due 
to associated comorbidities, side effects from antihypertensive medications and
awareness of the diagnosis. Anemia has been associated with HRQOL, but concerns
about the safety of erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) have led to more
conservative anemia treatment. Frailty, symptom burden and depression are also
major contributory factors to HRQOL in CKD.
SUMMARY: Certain determinants of HRQOL in CKD, namely anemia and depression, are 
treatable. Early identification and correction may improve overall well being of 
patients. Clinical trials are required to demonstrate whether treatment
interventions benefit HRQOL in this high-risk population. Furthermore, whether
integration of HRQOL assessment into routine clinical practice will improve HRQOL
outcomes remains to be determined.

A review of the effects of growth hormone changes on symptoms of frailty in the
elderly with chronic kidney disease.

The incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing
worldwide, especially in the elderly. Recently, functional impairment and frailty
have been recognized as factors affecting the quality of life, and outcomes in
elderly patients with CKD and therapeutic interventions to improve function and
reduce frailty are therefore being considered. Growth hormone (GH) levels
decrease with age and GH actions are impaired in CKD patients. GH stimulates
protein synthesis, bone, and glucose metabolism, and affects body composition by 
reducing body fat and increasing lean body mass. An increase in lean body mass
may reduce frailty and thus avoid functional impairment. Thus, providing GH to
elderly CKD patients could potentially improve outcomes and quality of life by
lowering the risk of frailty and associated functional impairment. There are few 
studies assessing the long-term effects of GH administration on symptoms of
frailty in elderly patients with CKD. In this review we will try to shed some
light on the trials assessing the administration of GH to elderly subjects and to
patients with CKD and focus on the possible role GH administration may play to
improve frailty and quality of life in those patients.

Older adults (aged >or=65 years) comprise the largest segment of the CKD
population, and impaired kidney function is linked with unsuccessful aging.
Individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease have clinical features of the
frailty phenotype, suggesting that frailty is not confined to old age among
vulnerable populations. This manifests as a high prevalence of impaired physical 
performance, emergent geriatric syndromes, disability, and risk of death.
Considering the multiple system involvement underlying the symptoms and deficits 
seen in CKD, especially in the more severe stages, the concept of frailty is a
highly useful tool to identify older adults with kidney disease who are on the
trajectory of vulnerability leading to decline and death. Further work is needed 
to characterize the relationship between kidney disease and frailty and to
identify opportunities to intervene.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is common in the elderly and in persons with chronic
diseases. Few studies have examined the association of frailty with chronic
kidney disease.
METHODS: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to estimate the prevalence of frailty among persons with chronic kidney
disease. We created a definition of frailty based on established validated
criteria, modified to accommodate available data. We used logistic regression to 
determine whether and to what degree stages of chronic kidney disease were
associated with frailty. We also examined factors that might mediate the
association between frailty and chronic kidney disease.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of frailty was 2.8%. However, among persons with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <
45 mL/min/1.73 m2), 20.9% were frail. The odds of frailty were significantly
increased among all stages of chronic kidney disease, even after adjustment for
the residual effects of age, sex, race, and prevalent chronic diseases. The odds 
of frailty associated with chronic kidney disease were only marginally attenuated
with additional adjustment for sarcopenia, anemia, acidosis, inflammation,
vitamin D deficiency, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Frailty and
chronic kidney disease were independently associated with mortality.
CONCLUSION: Frailty is significantly associated with all stages of chronic kidney
disease and particularly with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease.
Potential mechanisms underlying the chronic kidney disease and frailty connection
remain elusive.

Peritoneal dialysis in the elderly.

The elderly on dialysis have unique needs and characteristics and their outcomes 
vary from those of their younger counterparts. Comparatively fewer will start or 
be maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared to younger patients despite
the fact that haemodialysis is often poorly tolerated. A home-based treatment
also avoids the need for transport which can be expensive and adversely affect
the quality of life of a patient. Barriers to PD for older patients include poor 
vision, frailty, cognitive dysfunction, accommodation issues and a prejudice from
renal teams that older patients cannot do PD. In France, where assistance from
community nurses has been available for many years, PD is predominantly a
treatment for the elderly and older, sicker patients are often preferentially
placed on PD. The use of assisted PD is growing in other countries and where this
happens, there is a growth in the prevalent PD population. The ability of older
patients to use PD as their dialysis modality should not be determined by whether
they live in an area where the nephrologist is a PD enthusiast or not. Patients
have the right to receive appropriate non-biased information so they can choose
the dialysis modality which gives them the best quality of life and suits their
and their family's lifestyle.

How to persuade peritoneal dialysis - skeptical hemodialysis fans.

Already from its early decades, peritoneal dialysis (PD) has proved to be
efficient and able to confer similar or better chronic patient survival in
comparison with hemodialysis (HD). More recent years allowed many PD therapy
advances with further outcomes improvement: mortality, hospitalizations and
clinical complications all have been reduced across patient's vintages. Adequacy 
parameters of PD also compare advantageously with the erroneously named
'high-efficiency' HD which is now facing the limitations of intermittent
procedures, frailty of KT/V as measure of adequacy, importance of sustained fluid
removal and time of dialysis. Adequacy should also include life satisfaction and 
PD also compares favorably as a home therapy. The best approach, also the most
intelligent and cost-effective, would be not to underestimate a different
therapy, but discover how complementary it can be for success of long term

The majority of colorectal cancer patients receive chemotherapy either to
palliate advanced unresectable disease or to reduce the risk of recurrence after 
radical surgery. Thanks to the improvements in systemic chemotherapy, in the last
20 years the median survival time for patients with unresectable metastatic
disease has indeed progressively increased from less than 6 to almost 24 months
and recurrences after radical surgery in patients with early-stage tumors have
been halved. Although colorectal cancer incidence increase with aging, there is
limited scientific evidence based on prospective clinical trials to guide the
management of elderly colorectal cancer patients. In addition, aging is a
continuum process making strict cut-off difficult to define and homogeneous
subgroups hard to identify. There is significant heterogeneity also as regards
comorbidities, overall physical ability, mental health and functional status.
Specific guidelines for the medical treatment of elderly colorectal cancer
patients are therefore difficult to draw. While fit patients are generally
treated with adult protocols and frail individuals rarely receive chemotherapy,
managing the intermediate vulnerable patients requires a careful balance between 
the biological and psycho-social costs of treatment, the aggressiveness of the
tumor and its perception by the patient. In this review, the major achievements
of chemotherapy in the treatment of colorectal cancer will be described and the
available data addressing the extension of these chemotherapy programs to elderly
patients will be discussed. Special emphasis will be given to the development of 
specific treatment strategies depending on the degree of disease aggressiveness. 
Empirical suggestions to adapt the chemotherapy programs developed for adult fit 
patients to subjects with various degrees of vulnerability and frailty will also 
be given along with practical indications for the use of specific
chemotherapeutic agents in the presence of some common elderly-related
comorbidities.

Relative risk frailty models are used extensively in analyzing clustered and/or
recurrent time-to-event data. In this paper, Laplace's approximation for
integrals is applied to marginal distributions of data arising from parametric
relative risk frailty models. Under regularity conditions, the approximate
maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) are consistent with a rate of convergence
that depends on both the number of subjects and number of members per subject. We
compare the approximate MLE against alternative estimators using limited
simulation and demonstrate the utility of Laplace's approximation approach by
analyzing U.S. patient waiting time to deceased kidney transplant data.

In many longitudinal clinical studies, the level and progression rate of
repeatedly measured biomarkers on each subject quantify the severity of the
disease and that subject's susceptibility to progression of the disease. It is of
scientific and clinical interest to relate such quantities to a later
time-to-event clinical endpoint such as patient survival. This is usually done
with a shared parameter model. In such models, the longitudinal biomarker data
and the survival outcome of each subject are assumed to be conditionally
independent given subject-level severity or susceptibility (also called frailty
in statistical terms). In this article, we study the case where the conditional
distribution of longitudinal data is modeled by a linear mixed-effect model, and 
the conditional distribution of the survival data is given by a Cox proportional 
hazard model. We allow unknown regression coefficients and time-dependent
covariates in both models. The proposed estimators are maximizers of an exact
correction to the joint log likelihood with the frailties eliminated as nuisance 
parameters, an idea that originated from correction of covariate measurement
error in measurement error models. The corrected joint log likelihood is shown to
be asymptotically concave and leads to consistent and asymptotically normal
estimators. Unlike most published methods for joint modeling, the proposed
estimation procedure does not rely on distributional assumptions of the
frailties. The proposed method was studied in simulations and applied to a data
set from the Hemodialysis Study.

OBJECTIVE: Frailty is an emergent health-related problem in older adults. The aim
of this study was to examine the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and the
effect of frailty in elderly patients with cardiometabolic risk factors.
METHODS: One-hundred and one patients 65 years or older responded to an HRQOL
assessment using the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-26
questionnaire. Frailty was assessed using two indices: the Hebrew Rehabilitation 
Center for Aged (HRCA) vulnerability index and the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES)
index. In addition, these patients completed self-rating questionnaires assessing
mental well-being [the 28-item version of the General Health Questionnaire
(GHQ-28)] and depression (Geriatric Depression Scale).
RESULTS: Based on the combination of HRCA and VES indices, 24 subjects (23.7%)
met the criteria of frail. Persons > or = 75 years old and those with depressive 
mood or lower creatinine clearance had significantly lower WHOQOL-26 scores than 
their counterparts. Diabetes and macrovascular complications did not associate
with the WHOQOL-26 scores. Compared with non-frail patients, the frail scored
lower on the WHOQOL-26 questionnaire after adjusting for age, kidney dysfunction 
and depressive mood. Frail patients also reported significantly higher the GHQ-28
scores compared with non-frail patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Frail older adults had a significant lower HRQOL, as well as lower
mental well-being, independent of age, diabetes, macrovascular complication,
kidney dysfunction and depressed mood.

Highly active antiretroviral treatment has resulted in dramatically increased
life expectancy among patients with HIV infection who are now aging while
receiving treatment and are at risk of developing chronic diseases associated
with advanced age. Similarities between aging and the courses of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
suggest that HIV infection compresses the aging process, perhaps accelerating
comorbidities and frailty. In a workshop organized by the Association of
Specialty Professors, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the HIV Medical
Association, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institute on
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, researchers in infectious diseases, geriatrics, 
immunology, and gerontology met to review what is known about HIV infection and
aging, to identify research gaps, and to suggest high priority topics for future 
research. Answers to the questions posed are likely to help prioritize and
balance strategies to slow the progression of HIV infection, to address
comorbidities and drug toxicity, and to enhance understanding about both HIV
infection and aging.

BACKGROUND: Older dialysis patients have a high burden of mortality and
morbidity. Frailty and functional disability are common. One of the main
determinants of functional disability in nondialysis populations is acute
hospitalization. Such episodes are predictive of increased mortality and a future
need for long-term care. Based on the high prevalence of disability in the
dialysis population, we undertook a pilot study to determine functional
impairment at the time of admission and again at 1 week after discharge.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Prevalent dialysis patients older than 65 years admitted 
to a single acute-care institution during a 3-month period.
OUTCOMES: The proportion of dialysis patients with difficulty with activities of 
daily living at baseline and 1 week after discharge.
MEASUREMENT: Basic activities of daily living; Lawton Brody Instrumental
Activities of Daily Living score; timed up-and-go and handgrip tests; Trails A & 
B, and the clock test.
RESULTS: At the time of admission, only 8 of 35 individuals reported being
independent with basic activities of daily living. None of the patients was
independent with instrumental activities of daily living. At 1 week after
discharge, patients showed deterioration in all aspects of function except the
ability to use the telephone and manage their financial affairs. A total of 73.3%
of patients (95% confidence interval, 54.1 to 87.7) experienced a decline in
personal functional independence in association with hospitalization.
LIMITATIONS: This is a pilot study with a small number of patients who were
studied at only 2 times (admission and 1 week after discharge).
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that hospitalization is associated
with a high rate of disability in elderly dialysis patients. Further study is
required to determine whether the functional deterioration seen with
hospitalization improves over time.

Dedicated European and US clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes in the elderly 
have been released, but they do not specifically address the issue of advanced
chronic kidney disease (CKD) in older patients with diabetes. General clinical
guidelines have been published on the treatment of patients with diabetic
nephropathy (DN), but these address the issue of how to prevent progression and
treat advanced DN without distinguishing between different age groups. Elderly
patients with diabetes and stages 3 to 4 CKD have particular needs that differ
from those of younger patients with the same conditions. This is mainly due to
their frailty and shorter life expectancy. Differently tailored therapeutic
strategies are needed, which may have less stringent targets; and the use of
common drugs should be critically evaluated. The management agenda (metabolic
control, low-protein diet, controlling BP, preventing progression of advanced DN,
preventing cardiovascular outcomes) for these patients is discussed in light of
the limits and perspectives of current guidelines. Intensive, simultaneous
management of all items on the agenda may not be feasible for a proportion of
older patients, and clinicians may have to give priority to reducing some risk
factors rather than others, choosing between different therapies.

BACKGROUND: Given the volume and cost of inpatient care during the last year of
life, there is a critical need to identify patterns of dying as a means of
planning end-of-life care services, especially for the growing number of older
persons who receive services from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
METHODS: A retrospective computerized record review was conducted of 20,933 VHA
patients who died as inpatients between October 1, 2001 and September 30, 2002.
Diagnoses were aggregated into one of five classification patterns of death and
analyzed in terms of health care resource utilization (mean number of inpatient
days and cumulative outpatient visits in the year preceding the patient's death).
RESULTS: Cancer deaths were the most common (30.4%) followed by end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) (23.2%), cardiopulmonary failure (21.4%), frailty (11.6%), "other"
diagnoses (7.3%), and sudden deaths (6.1%). Those with ESRD were more likely to
be male and nonwhite (p < 0.05) and those with frailty were more likely to be
older and married (p < 0.05). Controlling for demographic variables, those with
frailty had the highest number of inpatient days while those with ESRD had the
highest number of outpatient visits. Non-married status was associated with more 
inpatient days, especially among younger decedents.
CONCLUSION: As a recognized leader in end-of-life care, the VHA can play a unique
role in the development of specific interventions that address the diverse needs 
of persons with different dying trajectories identified through this research.

Dialysis patients are increasingly older and more disabled. In community-dwelling
seniors without kidney disease, falls commonly predict hospitalization, the onset
of frailty, and the need for institutional care. Effective fall prevention
strategies are available. On the basis of retrospective data, it was hypothesized
that the fall rates of older (> or =65 yr) chronic outpatient hemodialysis (HD)
patients would be higher than published rates for community-dwelling seniors (0.6
to 0.8 falls/patient-year). It also was hypothesized that risk factors for falls 
in dialysis outpatients would include polypharmacy, dialysis-related hypotension,
cognitive impairment, and decreased functional status. Using a prospective cohort
study design, HD patients who were > or =65 yr of age at a large academic
dialysis unit were recruited. All study participants underwent baseline screening
for fall risk factors. Patients were followed prospectively for a minimum of 1
yr. Falls were identified through biweekly patient interviews in the HD unit. A
total of 162 patients (mean age 74.7 yr) were recruited; 57% were male. A total
of 305 falls occurred in 76 (47%) patients over 190.5 person-years of follow-up
(fall-incidence 1.60 falls/person-year). Injuries occurred in 19% of falls; 41
patients had multiple falls. Associated risk factors included age, comorbidity,
mean predialysis systolic BP, and a history of falls. In the HD population, the
fall risk is higher than in the general community, and fall-related morbidity is 
high. Better identification of HD patients who are at risk for falls and targeted
fall intervention strategies are required.

New advances in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) change the
perspective from which many of its features and treatment are viewed. Calcium,
phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and vitamin D have been shown to be
important determinants of survival associated with kidney diseases. Now ROD
dependent and independent of these factors is linked to survival more than just
skeletal frailty. This review focuses on recent discoveries that renal injury
impairs skeletal anabolism decreasing the osteoblast compartment of the skeleton 
and consequent bone formation. This discovery and the discovery that PTH
regulates the hematopoietic stem cell niche alters our view of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) from that of a disease to
that of a necessary adaptation to renal injury that goes awry. Furthermore, ROD
is shown to be an underappreciated factor in the level of the serum phosphorus in
CKD. The discovery and the elucidation of the mechanism of hyperphosphatemia as a
cardiovascular risk in CKD change the view of ROD. It is now recognized as more
than a skeletal disorder, it is an important component of the mortality of CKD
that can be treated.

Acute coronary care in the elderly, part I: Non-ST-segment-elevation acute

BACKGROUND: Age is an important determinant of outcomes for patients with acute
coronary syndromes (ACS); however, community practice reveals a
disproportionately lower use of cardiovascular medications and invasive treatment
even among elderly patients with ACS who would stand to benefit. Reasons include 
limited trial data to guide the care of older adults and uncertainty about
benefits and risks, particularly with newer medications or invasive treatments
and in the setting of advanced age or complex health status.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This 2-part American Heart Association scientific statement 
summarizes evidence on patient heterogeneity, clinical presentation, and
treatment of non-ST-elevation ACS in relation to age (< 65, 65 to 74, 75 to 84,
and > or = 85 years). In addition, we review methodological issues that influence
the acquisition and application of evidence to the elderly patients treated in
community practice. A writing group combining international cardiovascular and
geriatric perspectives convened to summarize available data from trials (5
combined Virtual Coordinating Center for Global Collaborative Cardiovascular
Research [VIGOUR] trials) and 3 registries (Global Registry of Acute Coronary
Events, National Registry of Myocardial Infarction, and the Can Rapid risk
stratification of Unstable angina patients Suppress ADverse outcomes with Early
implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
guidelines national quality improvement initiative [CRUSADE]) to provide a
conceptual framework for future work in the care of the elderly with acute
cardiac disease. Treatment for non-ST-segment-elevation ACS (Part I) and
ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (Part II) are reviewed. In addition,
ethical considerations pertaining to acute care and secondary prevention are
considered (Part II). The primary goal is to identify the areas in which
sufficient evidence is available to guide practice, as well as to determine areas
that warrant further study. Although treatment-related benefits should rise in an
elderly population with high disease risk, data to assess these benefits are
limited, outcomes of importance vary, and heterogeneity among the elderly
increases treatment-related risks. Although a uniform approach to care in the
oldest of the old is unlikely, understanding the major contributors to benefits
and risks from treatment will advance the ability to apply guideline-based care
in this subset of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Although a few recent trials have described treatment effects in
older patients, others continue to exclude patients on the basis of age. Going
forward, prospective trials should enroll elderly subjects proportionate to their
prevalence among the treated population to define risk and benefit. Findings from
age subgroup analyses should be reported in a consistent manner across trials,
including absolute and relative risks for efficacy and safety. Outcomes of
particular relevance to the elderly, such as quality of life, physical function, 
and independence, should also be considered. Creatinine clearance should be
calculated for every elderly patient to enable appropriate dosing. In addition,
physicians need an understanding of conditions unique to older patients (eg,
frailty, cognitive impairment) that influence treatment goals and outcomes. With 
these efforts, treatment risks can be minimized, and benefits can be placed in
the health context of the elderly patient with ACS.

In clinical and observational studies, recurrent event data (e.g.,
hospitalization) with a terminal event (e.g., death) are often encountered. In
many instances, the terminal event is strongly correlated with the recurrent
event process. In this article, we propose a semiparametric method to jointly
model the recurrent and terminal event processes. The dependence is modeled by a 
shared gamma frailty that is included in both the recurrent event rate and
terminal event hazard function. Marginal models are used to estimate the
regression effects on the terminal and recurrent event processes, and a Poisson
model is used to estimate the dispersion of the frailty variable. A sandwich
estimator is used to achieve additional robustness. An analysis of
hospitalization data for patients in the peritoneal dialysis study is presented
to illustrate the proposed method.

Estimating stage occupation probabilities in non-Markov models.

We study non-Markov multistage models under dependent censoring regarding
estimation of stage occupation probabilities. The individual transition and
censoring mechanisms are linked together through covariate processes that affect 
both the transition intensities and the censoring hazard for the corresponding
subjects. In order to adjust for the dependent censoring, an additive hazard
regression model is applied to the censoring times, and all observed counting and
"at risk" processes are subsequently given an inverse probability of censoring
weighted form. We examine the bias of the Datta-Satten and Aalen-Johansen
estimators of stage occupation probability, and also consider the variability of 
these estimators by studying their estimated standard errors and mean squared
errors. Results from different simulation studies of frailty models indicate that
the Datta-Satten estimator is approximately unbiased, whereas the Aalen-Johansen 
estimator either under- or overestimates the stage occupation probability due to 
the dependent nature of the censoring process. However, in our simulations, the
mean squared error of the latter estimator tends to be slightly smaller than that
of the former estimator. Studies on development of nephropathy among diabetics
and on blood platelet recovery among bone marrow transplant patients are used as 
demonstrations on how the two estimation methods work in practice. Our analyses
show that the Datta-Satten estimator performs well in estimating stage occupation
probability, but that the censoring mechanism has to be quite selective before a 
deviation from the Aalen-Johansen estimator is of practical importance.

Anemia, defined as a lower than normal level of serum hemoglobin, is a common
condition among the elderly, and it is often attributed to normal consequences of
aging. Anemia in older individuals is frequently undiagnosed and untreated. The
impact of untreated anemia can be severe, including increased risk of death, loss
of independent functioning, physical decline, falls and fractures, frailty,
cognitive decline, cardiovascular events and added economic burden to society.
Treatment is available for many types of anemia. For anemia caused by nutritional
deficiencies, treatments include simple dietary modifications and/or iron
supplementation (e.g., iron, vitamin B12 or folate). Transfusion or
erythropoietic agents (e.g., epoetin alfa, epoetin beta and darbepoetin alfa) are
used for anemia of chronic diseases and their treatments (e.g.,
cancer/chemotherapy and chronic kidney disease). Evidence that highlights the
benefits of erythropoietic therapies and their use in the treatment of anemia of 
chronic disease in the elderly is reviewed in this article.

This study investigated mortality in 568 individuals from the Goessel Mennonite
community in rural central Kansas. There were three main objectives to this
research: 1) characterize mortality trends within a biologically well-defined
Mennonite community; 2) determine what biochemical, morphological, and
physiological risk factors could be related to all-cause mortality, stratified by
age and sex; and 3) compare these results to previously described variables that 
were associated with both biological age and mortality in this population.
Mortality data were obtained from three sources: Kansas Vital Records, the Social
Security death index, and church records. In total, 221 (39%) individuals were
found to have died in this population between January 1980-June 2002. Analogous
to the larger US population, the three leading causes of death in this community 
were heart disease, cancer, and stroke, accounting for 60% of all deaths. Besides
advancing age, the greatest biological risk factor in this population was
decreased amounts of albumin in men (relative risk, 2.47), potentially indicating
underreported cases of either chronic kidney disease or frailty syndrome for
males. Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated that increased amounts of
total cholesterol may provide a protective effect for elderly individuals. We
conclude, based on the previously described heritability of both albumin (h(2) = 
0.40) and total cholesterol (h(2) = 0.50) in this population, that underlying
genetic factors associated with both chronic degenerative diseases and biological
aging may have important implications for understanding mortality patterns in
this community.

A gradual diminution in the physiologic reserve or functional capacity over time 
is the characteristic hallmark of aging, and this has a direct impact on the
choice of cancer therapy and its toxicity profile in elderly patients with
cancer. With the expected rapid rise of the older population as a subgroup,
oncologists will increasingly treat elderly patients. Provision of competent care
to this increasing pool of older patients with cancer necessitates that oncology 
professionals become familiar with age-associated changes in organ physiology and
their impact on cancer treatment and toxicity. In this comprehensive review, we
have listed changes in cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and renal
physiology with aging. Also enumerated is the impact of these changes on cancer
therapy and toxicity in each organ system-based section. Cardiovascular changes
primarily lead to reduction of the cardiac functional reserve, with a consequent 
increase in the risk of congestive heart failure. Changes in gastrointestinal
physiology lead to increased mucosal damage. A reduction in pulmonary reserve has
implications for postradiation complications, and a decline in renal function
leads to an increased potential for nephrotoxicity. These changes impair the
ability of older patients with cancer to tolerate cancer therapy and increase
their risk of toxicities. This may lead to an overall decline in functional
status, resulting frailty, poor quality of life, and ultimately poor outcomes.
Becoming familiar with age-related physiologic changes is the first step for
oncologists seeking to better tailor their treatments. This, combined with
adoption of some of the clinical interventions suggested in this review, can help
better manage the geriatric oncology patient. Further research is necessary for
the development of more specific evidence-based recommendations.

In medical research recurrent event times can be analysed using a frailty model
in which the frailties for different individuals are independent and identically 
distributed. However, such a homogeneous assumption about frailties could
sometimes be suspect. For modelling heterogeneity in frailties we describe
dispersion frailty models arising from a new class of models, namely hierarchical
generalized linear models. Using the kidney infection data we illustrate how to
detect and model heterogeneity among frailties. Stratification of frailty models 
is also investigated.

BACKGROUND: Physiologic changes and disease-related alterations in organ function
occur with aging. These changes can affect drug pharmacokinetics in older
persons.
OBJECTIVE: This article reviews age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and their
clinical relevance.
METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted using the terms elderly and
pharmacokinetics. Other reviews were also included for literature searching. The 
review includes literature in particular from 1990 through April 2004. Some
articles from before 1990 were included to help illustrate principles of
age-related pharmacokinetics.
RESULTS: There are minor changes in drug absorption with aging. The effect of
aging on small-bowel transporter systems is not yet fully established.
Bioavailability of highly extracted drugs often is increased with age.
Transdermal absorption may be delayed, especially in the case of water-soluble
compounds. Fat-soluble drugs may distribute more widely and water-soluble drugs
less extensively in older persons. Hepatic drug metabolism shows wide
interindividual variation, and in many cases, there is an age-related decline in 
elimination of metabolized drugs, particularly those eliminated by the cytochrome
enzyme system. Any decrement in cytochrome enzyme metabolism appears
nonselective. Synthetic conjugation metabolism is less affected by age.
Pseudocapillarization of the sinusoidal endothelium in the liver, restricting
oxygen diffusion, and the decline in liver size and liver blood flow may
influence age-related changes in rate of hepatic metabolism. Frailty,
physiological stress, and illness are important predictors of drug metabolism in 
older individuals. Inhibition of drug metabolism is not altered with aging, but
induction is reduced in a minority of studies. Renal drug elimination typically
declines with age, commensurate with the fall in creatinine clearance. Renal
tubular organic acid transport may decline with age, while the function of the
organic base transporter is preserved but may be less responsive to stimulation.
CONCLUSION: Changes in pharmacokinetics occur due to age-related physiologic
perturbations. These changes contribute to altered dose requirements in older
persons, particularly in the case of drugs eliminated by the kidney.
Interindividual variation, disease, frailty, and stress may overshadow
age-related changes.

BACKGROUND: Attention to psycho-socio-spiritual needs is considered critical by
patients with life-threatening illnesses and their caregivers. Palliative care
interventions that address these needs--particularly spirituality--are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of an innovative program to address
psycho-socio-spiritual needs in patients with life-threatening illnesses.
DESIGN: A group intervention entitled Life-Threatening Illness
Supportive-Affective Group Experience (LTI-SAGE) was developed for reducing
patient spiritual, emotional, and death-related distress.
SETTING/SUBJECTS: African American and Caucasian patients (n = 69) from two
hospitals in St. Louis, Missouri, with life-threatening medical conditions
(cancer; human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome
[HIV/AIDS]; geriatric frailty; liver, kidney, pulmonary, or cardiovascular
disease) were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Intervention
patients participated in a maximum of 12 LTI-SAGE groups over a 12-month period. 
Control patients received standard care.
MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures were depression symptoms, anxiety, spiritual
well-being, and death-related emotional distress.
RESULTS: After attrition, 51 (73.9%) patients completed the trial. At the end of 
the trial, after factoring in compliance, intervention patients had significantly
fewer depression symptoms and death-related feelings of meaninglessness and
significantly better spiritual well-being than did control patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of the LTI-SAGE model for enhancing the end-of-life illness 
experience is promising.

Analysis of clustered recurrent event data with application to hospitalization
rates among renal failure patients.

End-stage renal disease (commonly referred to as renal failure) is of increasing 
concern in the United States and many countries worldwide. Incidence rates have
increased, while the supply of donor organs has not kept pace with the demand.
Although renal transplantation has generally been shown to be superior to
dialysis with respect to mortality, very little research has been directed
towards comparing transplant and wait-list patients with respect to morbidity.
Using national data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we
compare transplant and wait-list hospitalization rates. Hospitalizations are
subject to two levels of dependence. In addition to the dependence among
within-patient events, patients are also clustered by listing center. We propose 
two marginal methods to analyze such clustered recurrent event data; the first
model postulates a common baseline event rate, while the second features
cluster-specific baseline rates. Our results indicate that kidney transplantation
offers a significant decrease in hospitalization, but that the effect is negated 
by a waiting time (until transplant) of more than 2 years. Moreover, graft
failure (GF) results in a significant increase in the hospitalization rate which 
is greatest in the first month post-GF, but remains significantly elevated up to 
4 years later. We also compare results from the proposed models to those based on
a frailty model, with the various methods compared and contrasted.

We develop a joint model for the analysis of longitudinal and survival data in
the presence of data clustering. We use a mixed effects model for the repeated
measures that incorporates both subject- and cluster-level random effects, with
subjects nested within clusters. A Cox frailty model is used for the survival
model in order to accommodate the clustering. We then link the two responses via 
the common cluster-level random effects, or frailties. This model allows us to
simultaneously evaluate the effect of covariates on the two types of responses,
while accounting for both the relationship between the responses and data
clustering. The model was motivated by a study of end-stage renal disease
patients undergoing hemodialysis, where we wished to evaluate the effect of iron 
treatment on both the patients' hemoglobin levels and survival times, with the
patients clustered by enrollment site.

There has been an increasing interest in the analysis of recurrent event data
(Cook and Lawless, 2002, Statistical Methods in Medical Research 11, 141-166). In
many situations, a terminating event such as death can happen during the
follow-up period to preclude further occurrence of the recurrent events.
Furthermore, the death time may be dependent on the recurrent event history. In
this article we consider frailty proportional hazards models for the recurrent
and terminal event processes. The dependence is modeled by conditioning on a
shared frailty that is included in both hazard functions. Covariate effects can
be taken into account in the model as well. Maximum likelihood estimation and
inference are carried out through a Monte Carlo EM algorithm with
Metropolis-Hastings sampler in the E-step. An analysis of hospitalization and
death data for waitlisted dialysis patients is presented to illustrate the
proposed methods. Methods to check the validity of the proposed model are also
demonstrated. This model avoids the difficulties encountered in alternative
approaches which attempt to specify a dependent joint distribution with marginal 
proportional hazards and yields an estimate of the degree of dependence.

Frailty models are frequently used to analyse clustered survival data. The
assumption of non-informative censoring is commonly used by these models, even
though it may not be true in many situations. This article proposes a test for
this assumption. It uses the estimated correlation between two types of
martingale residuals, one from a model for failure and the other from a model for
censoring. It distinguishes two types of censoring, namely withdrawal and the end
of the study. Simulation studies show that the proposed test works well under
various scenarios. For illustration, the test is applied to a data set for kidney
disease patients from multiple dialysis centres.

BACKGROUND: Frailty has been defined as a tool to define individuals who lack
functional reserve and are at risk for functional decline. We hypothesized that
chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) would be associated with a greater prevalence
of frailty and disability in the elderly.
METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis used baseline data collected from the
Cardiovascular Health Study, which enrolled 5,888 community-dwelling adults aged 
65 years or older from 4 clinical centers in the United States. Renal
insufficiency is defined as a serum creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL or greater (>
or =115 micromol/L) in women and 1.5 mg/dL or greater (> or =133 micromol/L) in
men. Frailty is defined by the presence of 3 of the following abnormalities:
unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, measured weakness, slow
walking speed, and low physical activity. Disability is defined as any
self-reported difficulty with activities of daily living.
RESULTS: Among 5,808 participants with creatinine levels measured at entry, 15.9%
of men (n = 394) and 7.6% of women (n = 254) had CRI. Prevalences of frailty (15%
versus 6%; P < 0.001) and disability (12% versus 7%; P = 0.001) were greater in
participants with CRI compared with those with normal renal function. After
multivariate adjustment for comorbidity, CRI remained significantly associated
with frailty (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 2.41), but not
disability (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 1.69).
CONCLUSION: Elderly persons with CRI have a high prevalence of frailty, which may
signal their risk for progression to adverse health outcomes. If confirmed in
other studies, identification of frailty in patients with CRI may warrant special
interventions to preserve their independence, quality of life, and survival.

OBJECTIVE: Dialysis is the most common renal replacement therapy for patients
with end stage renal disease. This paper considers survival of dialysis patients,
aiming to assess quality of renal replacement therapy at dialysis centers in Rio 
de Janeiro, Brazil, and to investigate differences in survival between health
facilities.
METHODS: A Cox proportional hazards model, allowing for time-varying covariates
and prevalent data, was the basic method used to analyze the survival of 11,579
patients on hemodialysis in 67 health facilities in Rio de Janeiro State from
January 1998 until August 2001, using data obtained from routine information
systems. A frailty random effects model was applied to investigate differences in
mortality between health centers not explained by measured characteristics.
RESULTS: The individual variables associated with the outcome were age and
underlying disease, with diabetes being the main isolated risk factor.
Considering covariates of the health unit, two factors were associated with
performance: bigger units had on average better survival times than smaller ones 
and units which offered cyclic peritoneal dialysis performed less well than those
that did not. There were significant frailty effects among centers, with relative
risks varying between 0.24 and 3.15, and an estimated variance of 0.43.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine assessment based on health registries of the outcome of any 
high technology medical treatment is extremely important in maintaining quality
of care and in estimating the impact of changes in therapies, units, and patient 
profiles. The frailty model allowed estimation of variation in risk between
centers not attributable to any measured covariates. This can be used to guide
more specific investigation and changes in health policies related to renal
transplant therapies.

USA. xueling@umich.edu

To account for the correlation between failure and censoring, we propose a new
frailty model for clustered data. In this model, the risk to be censored is
affected by the risk of failure. This model allows flexibility in the direction
and degree of dependence between failure and censoring. It includes the
traditional frailty model as a special case. It allows censoring by some causes
to be analyzed as informative while treating censoring by other causes as
noninformative. It can also analyze data for competing risks. To fit the model,
the EM algorithm is used with Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations in the
E-steps. Simulation studies and analysis of data for kidney disease patients are 
provided. Consequences of incorrectly assuming noninformative censoring are
investigated.

The purpose of this study was to identify demographic, disease, health care, and 
psychosocial-spiritual factors associated with death distress (death-related
depression and anxiety). Cross-sectional baseline data from a randomized
controlled trial were used. Outpatients (n=70) were recruited from an urban
academic medical centre and proprietary hospital. All patients had
life-threatening medical conditions, including cancer; pulmonary, cardiac, liver,
or kidney disease; HIV/AIDS; or geriatric frailty. Measures of death distress,
physical symptom severity, depression and anxiety symptoms, spiritual well-being,
social support, patient-perceived physician communication, and patient-perceived 
quality of health care experiences were administered. In a hierarchical multiple 
regression model, higher death distress was significantly associated with living 
alone, greater physical symptom severity, more severe depression symptoms, lower 
spiritual well-being, and less physician communication as perceived by the
patient. Death distress as a unique experiential construct was discriminable
among younger patients with specific, diagnosable life-threatening conditions,
but less so among geriatric frailty patients. The findings suggest that the
experience of death distress among patients with life-threatening medical
conditions is associated with the psychosocial-spiritual dimensions of the
patient's life. Attention to these dimensions may buffer the negative affects of 
death distress.

The emergence of the sub-speciality geriatric nephrology is an exciting
development for the future. The main objectives should be to maximise patient
independence and minimise deterioration and learn dependent behaviour in this
population. To achieve these goals a holistic approach needs to be taken, to the 
patient, their environment and the efficacy of such units, and this can only be
achieved using a multi-disciplinary team approach. In the creation of a geriatric
nephrology unit it is important to identify the factors that cause frailty and,
if possible, modify or prevent the initial decline using nutritional and other
interventions. This requires careful monitoring, not only using the traditional
markers of renal disease including urea and creatinine, but also using
instruments that measure functional ability. These issues are discussed under the
headings prevention, documentation and planning.

In this paper, we describe Bayesian modeling of dependent multivariate survival
data using positive stable frailty distributions. A flexible baseline hazard
formulation using a piecewise exponential model with a correlated prior process
is used. The estimation of the stable law parameter together with the parameters 
of the (conditional) proportional hazards model is facilitated by a modified
Gibbs sampling procedure. The methodology is illustrated on kidney infection data
(McGilchrist and Aisbett, 1991).

The accelerated failure time (AFT) model is an important alternative to the Cox
proportional hazards model (PHM) in survival analysis. For multivariate failure
time data we propose to use frailties to explicitly account for possible
correlations (and heterogeneity) among failure times. An EM-like algorithm
analogous to that in the frailty model for the Cox model is adapted. Through
simulation it is shown that its performance compares favorably with that of the
marginal independence approach. For illustration we reanalyze a real data set.

The use of frailty models in genetic studies: application to the relationship
between end-stage renal failure and mutation type in Alport syndrome. European

BACKGROUND: Alport syndrome (AS) is a severe hereditary disease usually
transmitted as an X dominant trait and involving a mutation of the COL4A5 gene.
It leads to end-stage renal failure (ESRF), but this progression is
heterogeneous. Mutations of the COL4A5 gene have been characterised in numerous
families using molecular biology. Our objective was to evaluate the interfamilial
heterogeneity of the disease and to study relationships between mutation types
and progression to ESRF in the European Community Alport Syndrome Concerted
Action group (ECASCA) registry database.
METHODS: We used the frailty model framework. Frailty models have been developed 
to analyse censored data with non-independent observations. Random effects are
introduced in a Cox proportional regression model to take into account the
intracluster correlations. In this study, ESRF is considered a censored event and
the intrafamilial correlations are taken into account in the frailty models.
RESULTS: These approaches allow us to demonstrate the existence of an
interfamilial heterogeneity; the role of the mutation type explains the
interfamilial variability. In particular, the results suggest that some mutation 
types are associated with a higher risk of ESRF for males.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the importance of characterising the mutation at
the molecular level in genetic studies, to understand the relationship between
genotype and phenotype. The frailty models constitute an attractive approach in
this context, when the phenotype is characterised by a censored end-point.

BACKGROUND: Statistical analysis for correlated censored data allows to study
censored events in clustered structure designs. Considering a possible
correlation among failure times of the same group, standard methodology is no
longer applicable. We investigated proposed models in this context to study
familial data about a genetic disease, Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome is a
severe hereditary disease due to abnormal collagenous chains. Renal failure is
the main symptom of the disease. It progresses toward end-stage renal failure
(IRT) according to a high time variability. As shown by genetic studies,
mutations of COL4A5 gene are involved in the X-linked Alport Syndrome. Due to the
large range of the mutation types, the aim of this study was to search for a
possible genetic origin of the heterogeneity of the disease severity.
METHODS: Marginal survival models and mixed effects survival models (so-called
frailty models) were proposed to take into account the possible non independence 
of the observations. In this study, time until end-stage renal failure is a
rightly censored end point. Possible intra-familial correlations due to shared
environmental and/or genetic factors could induce dependence among familial
failure times. In this paper, we fit marginal and frailty proportional hazards
models to evaluate the effect of mutation type on the risk of IRT and an
interfamilial heterogeneity of failure times.
RESULTS: In this study, the use of these models allows to show the presence of an
interfamilial heterogeneity of the failure times to IRT. Moreover, the results
suggest that some mutation types are linked to a higher risk of fast evolution to
IRT, which explains partially the interfamilial heterogeneity of the failure
times.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper shows the interest of marginal and frailty models to
evaluate the heterogeneity of censored responses and to study relationships
between a censored criterion and covariables. This study puts forward the
importance of characterizing the mutation at a molecular level to understand the 
relationship between genotype and phenotype.

This article deals with the semiparametric analysis of multivariate survival data
with random block (group) effects. Survival times within the same group are
correlated as a consequence of a frailty random block effect. The standard
approaches assume either a parametric or a completely unknown baseline hazard
function. This paper considers an intermediate solution, that is, a nonparametric
function that is reasonably smooth. This is accomplished by a Bayesian model in
which the conditional proportional hazards model is used with a correlated prior 
process for the baseline hazard. The posterior likelihood based on data, as well 
as the prior process, is similar to the discretized penalized likelihood for the 
frailty model. The methodology is exemplified with the recurrent kidney
infections data of McGilchrist and Aisbett (1991, Biometrics 47, 461-466), in
which the times to infections within the same patients are expected to be
correlated. The reanalysis of the data has shown that the estimates of the
parameters of interest and the associated standard errors depend on the prior
knowledge about the smoothness of the baseline hazard.

Frequently in the analysis of survival data, survival times within the same group
are correlated due to unobserved co-variates. One way these co-variates can be
included in the model is as frailties. These frailty random block effects
generate dependency between the survival times of the individuals which are
conditionally independent given the frailty. Using a conditional proportional
hazards model, in conjunction with the frailty, a whole new family of models is
introduced. By considering a gamma frailty model, often the issue is to find an
appropriate model for the baseline hazard function. In this paper a flexible
baseline hazard model based on a correlated prior process is proposed and is
compared with a standard Weibull model. Several model diagnostics methods are
developed and model comparison is made using recently developed Bayesian model
selection criteria. The above methodologies are applied to the McGilchrist and
Aisbett (1991) kidney infection data and the analysis is performed using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo methods.

Duration time models often should include correlated failure times, due to
clustered data. These random effects hierarchical models sometimes are called
"frailty models" when used for survival analyses. The data analyzed here involve 
such correlations because patient level outcomes (the times until graft failure
following kidney transplantation) are observed, but patients are clustered in
different transplant centers. We describe fitting such models by combining two
kinds of software, one for parametric survival regression models, and the other
for doing Poisson regression in a hierarchical setting. The latter is implemented
by using PRIMM (Poisson Regression and Interactive Multilevel Modeling) methods
and software (Christiansen & Morris, 1994a). An illustrative example for
profiling data is included with k = 11 kidney transplant centers and N = 412
patients.

Psychosocial issues in end-stage renal disease: aging.

Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients presumably encounter multiple
stressors: the need to undergo treatment for a chronic, life-threatening illness,
age-related physical frailty and comorbidities, and exposure to psychosocial
losses related to aging. However, most studies comparing older patients
(typically patients aged 60 and older) with younger patients undergoing ESRD
therapy indicate that the psychosocial well-being reported by older patients is
at least as good as, and perhaps better than, the well-being reported by younger 
patients. These data reflect a health optimism generally characteristic of older 
persons, and ESRD patients' tendency to evaluate their functional status and
their psychosocial well-being as largely independent domains. At the same time,
availability of support from dialysis caregivers and from family members is
acknowledged as a crucial variable affecting older patients' ability to
successfully comply with treatment regimens and adjust to various ESRD therapies.
Differential psychosocial outcomes related to older patients' sociodemographic
characteristics are not well studied, but data from the United States show better
perceived physical status and psychosocial well-being among older
African-American patients than among older white patients on chronic dialysis.
Suggestions are offered for methodological and conceptual refinements of research
investigating the relation of age to psychosocial outcomes in ESRD.

Older end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated by chronic dialysis have
higher mortality in the United States than in many other countries. While
increasing age, white race, male sex, and/or diabetes are considered risk factors
for survival, few studies of older dialysis patients have simultaneously
considered multiple predictor variables and their interactions. Using information
contained in the 1982 to 1986 ESRD Network 20 database for Georgia and South
Carolina, we studied hospitalizations and survival of 1,354 blacks and 965 whites
who were age 60 years or older when they began dialysis therapy. Survival time
was modeled using the Cox life-table regression method. Older blacks' median age 
at dialysis initiation was 67.4, compared with 68.7 for older whites (P = 0.001).
Blacks were more likely than whites (P < 0.001) to have hypertension-related or
diabetes-related ESRD. White patients experienced approximately 25% more
hospitalization when adjustment was made for patient-days at risk. Separate
multivariate survival models were required for patients with diabetes-related
versus non-diabetes-related ESRD. Among diabetics, mortality was higher among
whites and among patients who were older when they began dialysis. Among patients
with non-diabetes-related ESRD, mortality was higher among patients who were
older when they began dialysis, but the age effect was much stronger for white
males. Our hospitalization and mortality data support the view that unmeasured
severity (or frailty) differences characterize white as compared with black
dialysis patients. Among non-diabetes-related ESRD patients, the age effect on
survival was more severe in white males than in blacks or in white females. The
high mortality we observed among older dialysis patients in Georgia and South
Carolina warrants further study; the data may in part reflect patients' lower
socioeconomic status compared with age, race, and sex-matched controls.
