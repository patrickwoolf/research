AB  - Background: Hemodialysis patients (HD) display high rates of cardiac disease and mortality. The cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of HD patients is attributable in a significant proportion to endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and vascular calcifications.; Aim: To measure vascular reactivity in HD subjects and compare them with healthy volunteers.; Material and Methods: Forty eight non diabetic patients aged 58 ± 4.6 years (29 males) on hemodialysis for a mean lapse of 4.8 years were studied. Arterial stiffness was measured in the radial artery. Pulse wave velocity was measured by noninvasive peripheral arterial tonometry in carotid and femoral arteries. Endothelial function was assessed, measuring reactive hyperemia response after a 5 min period of ischemia. As a control, all values were also measured in age and gender-matched healthy volunteers.; Results: Arterial stiffness was significantly higher in HD patients than controls (23.9 ± 3.3 and 18.4 ± 3.4% respectively, p < 0.05). HD subjects had an increased pulse wave velocity (10.0 ± 0.8 and 7.6 ± 0.9 m/s respectively, p < 0.05). A reduction in the change in pulse amplitude pressure, as a measure of arterial dysfunction, was only observed in male patients (1.7 ± 0.4 and 2.7 ± 0.4 respectively p < 0.01).; Conclusions: Noninvasive assessment of peripheral vascular function may be useful for the identification of patients at risk for late cardiac events.;

AB  - Introduction: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA; CALCYPHILAXIS) is a syndrome that occurs prevalently in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. It is characterized by the medial calcification of skin small arteries leading to necrotic lesions. Several risk factors have been identified: obesity, female gender, diabetes mellitus, hyperphosphatemia, inflammation, treatment with vitamin D, calcium-based phosphate binders and warfarin.; Materials and Methods: We report three cases of CUA observed from October 2011 to September 2014.; Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 56 years (range 33-68). Biochemistry showed: mean levels of PTH=1277 pg/ml (range 1000-1696), serum calcium =10.2 mg/dl (range 9.4-11.1), phosphorus=4.5 mg/dl (range 3.4-5.5). All patients were taking vitamin D, two patients were on warfarin therapy. Following actions were undertaken: interruption of calcium-based phosphate binders, vitamin D and warfarin therapy, initiation of cinacalcet and sodium thiosulfate therapy, use of dialysate with lowest available calcium concentration (1.25 mmol/l), Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, surgical dressings of skin lesions three times a week. Significant improvement was observed in mean levels of PTH (331 pg/ml, range 200-465), serum calcium (8.3 mg/dl, range 7.4-9.6) and phosphorus (3.4 mg/dl, range 2.6-3.8). In two out of three patients complete healing of ulcerative lesions was obtained.; Conclusions: These cases underline the importance of early diagnosis of CUA especially in patients with concomitant risk factors and careful clinical monitoring, being CUA characterized by a rapid evolution and high mortality.;

AB  - Unlabelled: Calciphylaxis characterized by schemic skin ulceration due to subcutaneous small arterioles calcification, is a rare disease but usually fatal. Disorders of calcium metabolism and vascular calcifications are common in dialysis patients but calciphylaxis prevalence is low in patients with end stage renal disease. So we proposed other emergent factors implicated in calciphylaxis development.; Methods: We studied retrospective 8 patients who developed calciphylaxis in our service from january 2001 to december 2006.; Results: All patients were female with mean age at diagnosis 68.5+/-6.7 years. All patients were receiving hemodialysis therapy and 6 patients had been receiving hemodialysis less than four months. Six patients had diabetes mellitus type II and all patients were obese (BMI >25 kg/m2). All patients had metabolic syndrome (APTIII) with bad control hypertension and 6 (75%) were receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Patients didn t have severe alterations of calcium metabolism, all had product calcium-phosphorus <55. All patients developed low blood pressure at the beginning of dialysis treatment (98.3+/-22.7/60+/-18,29 mmHg). 7 patients present proximal lesions in fatty regions like abdomen and thighs. Histopathologic examination reveals calcium deposits in arteriole-sized and small vessels with vascular thrombosis. Prognosis was poor, seven patients died secondary to a sepsis originated in infected cutaneous ulcers.; Conclusions: calciphylaxis is a disease with poor prognosis and high mortality, without specific treatment actually. Female gender, obesity associated with diabetes mellitus and cardiometabolic syndrome, anticoagulant therapy with warfarin and low blood pressure associated with hemodialysis therapy, are risk factors to develop calciphylaxis, in absence of severe disorders of calcium metabolism. In these patients is important to avoid hypotension episodes during dialysis, dialysis hypotension appears to be an important risk factor who promotes ischemia of subcutaneous adipose tissue.;

AB  - Unlabelled: Heart failure (CHF) and diastolic dysfuction (DD) relationship has received poor attention in hemodialysis patients (HD).; Objective: To analyse the incidence of CHF in our HD patients, the relationship with DD and impact on mortality.; Methods: We studied 79 patients: 48 +/- 15 years old, mean time on HD 83 +/- 63 months. Vascular calcification (PVC) was evaluated by radiologic series (55.7%). We analyzed the presence of clinical and analytical cardiovascular factors. All patients underwent M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography. Patients were followed for two years. Clinical information collected: incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD), CHF, and mortality due to cardiovascular events.; Results: Most frequent finding was Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) (93%), followed by DD (63.5% had anormal LV relaxation) (ALVR). Incidence of CHF was 38.3%; and was significantly associated with higher: time on HD (130/72 months), Ca x P (74/65), PTH (677/376), bone alkaline phosphatase (27/16), and systolic BP (145 vs 130 mmHg); IHD, PVC, valvular calcification (VC), LVH and ALVR (p < 0.01). Systolic function was normal in both groups (with/without CHF). Logistic regression identified as risk factors for CHF: ALVR (OR: 9.5), IHD (OR: 15) and systolic BP (OR: 2.2). ALVR was associated with greater age (55/37), longer time on HD (76/60), PVC and VC (p < 0.001). Predictor factors identified were age (OR: 2.13) and PVC (OR: 3.9).; Conclusions: HD patients showed a high incidence of CHF. IHD, systolic BP and DD (ALVR) have behave as risk factors for CHF. Vascular calcifications were intimately related to these findings and, therefore, they contribute to the greater mortality of these patients.;

AB  - Introduction: Cardiovascular disease and other complications of atherosclerosis are the most common cause of death in patients with chronic renal failure in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). Carotid ultrasonography is a simple non-invasive tool to investigate the vascular system, by means of intima media thickness (IMT) measurement and carotid wall calcifications.; Objective: To determine IMT and the presence of plaques, and their possible clinical relationships; finally we tried to investigate whether they would predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients in MHD.; Methods: We studied 60 MHD patients (age 68 +/- 13 years, 48% male, 50% diabetics, time on MHD 32 +/- 11 months) and a control group of 274 people matched for age and sex. Follow-up period was 66 +/- 13 months.; Measurements: Demographic and clinical data, serum levels of homocysteine (tHcy), folic acid (FA) and B6 and B12 vitamins. IMT was measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography.; Results: IMT was higher in MHD patients than in those in the control group (0.947 +/- 0.308 vs 0.619 +/- 0.176 mm; P < 0.001). IMT was related with age (r = 0.268; P = 0.038), diabetic (r = 0.650; P < 0.001) and hypertensive condition (r = 0.333; P = 0.012), but not wih lipids, tHcy or FA. Patients who suffered from coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease or stroke had higher IMT than those without those events (1.156 +/- 0.371 vs 0.875 +/- 0.285 mm; P < 0.001; 1.205 +/- 0.374 vs 0.911 +/- 0.231 mm; P = 0.007; 1.195 +/- 0.264 vs 0.844 +/- 0.251; P < 0.001 respectively). Something similar occurred with the presence of plaques. During the follow-up period 36 patients died (60%), 67% of them due to cardiovascular causes. IMT was higher in patients who died than those who survived (1.020 +/- 0.264 vs 0.858 +/- 0.334 mm; P = 0.044). The survival rate during the observation period was significantly lower in the final IMT fourth (20%) than in the first (72%) (P = 0.014). The presence of carotid plaques was an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality.; Conclusions: These findings suggests that measurement of carotid IMT and the presence of wall plaques are useful tools to predict cardiovascular events and mortality in patients in MHD.;

AB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of end stage kidney disease in the developed countries. Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) develops with deteriorating of the renal functions. Diabetic patients on hemodialysis are characterized by low bone turnover, higher prevalence of severe and progressive vascular calcification with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The main factor which causes vascular calcification in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is poor glycemic control. The recent trial findings describe an inverse correlation between intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) serum levels and glycemic control in a group of diabetic patients on hemodialysis.; Aim: The objective of the proposed project is to access the difference of the laboratory markers MBD in the group of patients with 3rd stage DKD depending on glycemic control. We focused on the relationship between the glycemic compensation of diabetes (HbA1c) and iPTH serum level.; Patients and Method: Ninety one patients with 3rd stage DKD were investigated. There were 46 women (50.5 %) and 45 men (49.5 %), average age of patients was 71.2 ± 7.0 years, with creatinine level 128 ± 30 μmol/l and estimated glomerular filtration (eGF, MDRD) 0.82 ± 0.16 ml/s. There were 60 patients with better glycemic control of diabetes (HbA1c < 7 %) vs 29 patients with poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c > 7 %). MBD markers were compared in both groups. Patients were further stratified into subgroups based on the serum level of iPTH (iPTH < 35 pg/ml vs iPTH > 35 pg/ml) and MBD markers compared. Statistical analysis was performed using and Mann-Whitney test.; Results: We have found the statistical significance in the serum phosphate and proteinuria levels in between groups with HbA1c < 7 % vs patients with HbA1c > 7 %. Diabetics with better glycemic control had significant reduction in serum phosphate level (1.14 ± 0.20 vs 1.23 ± 0.18 mmol/l, p = 0.038) and in 24 hrs proteinuria level (0.56 ± 1.35 vs 1.30 ± 1.61 g/day, p = 0.007). In the group of presumed low bone turnover (iPTH < 35 pg/ml) we have found the trend towards increased serum calcium level (2.49 ± 0.12 vs 2.43 ± 0.10 mmol/l, p = 0.063) and increased HbA1c value (7.5 ± 1.8 vs 6.4 ± 1.6 %, p = 0.023).; Conclusion: Our results suggest the closer relationship between glycemic control of diabetes and mineral-bone disorder in earlier stages of DKD.; Key Words: diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2T) - chronic kidney disease (CKD) - mineral and bone disorder (MBD).;

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) on the atherosclerosis progress in the maintenance hemodialysis patients.; Methods: We enrolled 19 patients with maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and 11 healthy people as control. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their age above or below 40 years old (11 and 8 in each, respectively), whereas the subjects in control group were below 40 years old. All the clinical information of the research subjects was collected: including age, gender, time of hemodialysis, blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCr). Immunohistochemistry and pathological image analysis were used to investigate the pathological changes, calcification and the expression of PAI-1, t-PA, and ET-1 on the blood vessel.; Results: Compared with the age-matched healthy control group, there were higher blood vascular media thickness, blood vascular media thickness/diagmeter ratio, blood vascular media thickness area/vascular inter-wall area ratio (P<0.05) and more calcification (P<0.05) in the the internal iliac artery in the chronic renal failure MHD patients. All the results were similar when compared the above 40 years old group with the below 40 years old one in the chronic renal failure MHD patients. There were positive correlation of blood vascular media thickness with age and blood pressure (P<0.05). Expression of PAI-1, ET-1, t-PA on the internal iliac artery vessel was elevated in the chronic renal failure MHD patients compared with the health control (P<0.05). The level of PAI-1 or ET-1 was much higher in the above 40 years old group than the below 40 years old one in the chronic renal failure MHD patients, whereas there was no significant difference in the t-PA expression between the 2 groups (P<0.05). There were positive correlation of PAI-1 or ET-1 expression with age and blood pressure (P<0.05). There were positive correlation of PAI-1 or ET-1 expression with blood vascular media thickness and calcification (P<0.05 or P<0.01). There was no correlation of hemodialysis time with blood vascular media thickness, calcification, PAI-1, t-PA, or ET-1 expressions.; Conclusion: MHD patients accompany with atherosclerosis which is severer in the patients above 40 years old than the patients below 40 years old. The higher of the blood pressure, the severer of the atherosclerosis. Abnormal expression of PAI-1 plays an important role in the progress of the atherosclerosis in the chronic renal failure MHD patients, whereas t-PA has no function in this process. The level of PAI-1 and ET-1 would be helpful to evaluating the degree of atherosclerosis in the chronic renal failure MHD patients. Hemodialysis time may not be a potential accelerator for atherosclerosis progression.;

AB  - The pulse wave velocity (PWV) of the aorta, of the arm, of the leg, was measured in 90 normal subjects (N) and 92 dialysis patients (D) of the same age and blood pressure status. All patients underwent blood biochemistry, especially serum liquid concentrations, and aortic ultra-sonography. Aortic calcifications were diagnosed by echo and radiologic examination. Aortic PWV was significantly higher in D (1,113 +/- 319 cm/s) than in N (965 +/- 216 cm/s) (p = 0.0016). The aortic diameters were greater in D both at the aortic root and at the bifurcation. The pulse pressure was higher in D (76.6 +/- 23.7 vs 63.9 +/- 2 mmHg, p = 0.007). In both populations, the PWV increased with age and blood pressure but aortic calcification was only weakly correlated with this increase. These results indicate that the compliance of the aortic wall is reduced in D and leads to an increase in the pulsatile component of the blood pressure and thereby to an increase in left ventricular afterload.;

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with arterial disease and left ventricular hypertrophy being the two principal factors of the high mortality rate in this population. In addition to traditional risk factors (age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, lifestyle, hyperlipidemia, smoking, hyperhomocystinemia), inflammation, oxidative stress and disorders of mineral metabolism may contribute to cardiovascular risk in patients with uremic syndrome. High serum phosphate may influence vascular calcifications directly and indirectly, by worsening secondary hyperparathyroidism. Several treatment options are available for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with ESRD. The treatment approach includes a diet low in phosphorus, with less than 1 g/kg/day of protein. Vitamin D supplementation is an important part of treatment. Phosphate binding agents are in most of the patients necessary in addition to diet. Aluminum hydroxide has been widely used for many years. It is very potent, but also very toxic, with severe encephalopathy as the most dangerous side effect. Calcium salts are less potent, and were considered safe for use in patients on dialysis. However, improvement in the understanding of vascular calcifications has demonstrated that calcium overload significantly contributes to widespread atherosclerosis in patients with ESRD. Sevelamer-hydrochloride is a novel non-aluminum, non-calcium containing phosphate binder, which is capable of reducing the levels of phosphorus as well as of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.;

AB  - Several factors influence the choice of phosphate binder for patients, including older age, male gender, post-menopause, diabetes, low bone turnover, vascular/valvular calcification and inflammation. Unlike calcium-based phosphate binders, non-calcium-based phosphate binders, such as sevelamer and lanthanum carbonate, have been able to reduce the progression of bone disease to adynamic bone among patients with CKD. New iron-based phosphate binders are now available. With multiple options available for the reduction of phosphate, the focus has been on agents that do not contain calcium. This is because it is thought that calcium itself functions as a substrate for calcification.;

AB  - Background: Patients receiving chronic hemodialysis develop complicated coronary lesions with tortuosity and calcification, which make stent delivery or expansion difficult. Restenosis rates are also higher than in patients without hemodialysis. Furthermore, there is a risk of polymer rubbing from the surface of a sirolimus-eluting stent(SES)placed across a calcified lesion. This study investigated the efficacy of SES for patients on hemodialysis compared with bare metal stent (BMS).; Methods and Results: Forty-two patients on hemodialysis underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for 46 de novo lesions treated with SES (SES group). Seventy-four patients with 78 de novo lesions were treated with BMS (BMS group). The mean age was 65.8 +/- 9.3 yr in the SES group, and 65.0 +/- 8.7 yr in the BMS group. The mean hemodialysis period was significantly longer in the SES group (9.2 +/- 7.9 vs 6.5 +/- 7.7 yr, p < 0.01). Angiographic characteristics and acute results showed no significant difference between the two groups. At 6 months follow-up, late loss was significantly smaller in the SES group (0.60 +/- 0.97 vs 1.60 +/- 1.15 mm, p < 0.05). Binary restenosis and target lesion revascularization were similar (34% vs 43%, 25% vs 36%, respectively, p = NS). Major adverse cardiac events, composite of death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization were also similar (23% vs 36%, p = NS).; Conclusions: Our study could not demonstrate the superiority of SES implantation in patients with hemodialysis compared to BMS implantation, which suggests the limitations of using SES.;

AB  - Background: Cardiac disease remains the major cause of death among ESRD patients. Indeed, the risk of cardiovascular events in ESRD is reported to be at least 3.4 fold higher than that of the general population. Moreover, annual mortality rates among ESRD patients on hemodialysis approximate 20%, with cardiovascular disease accounting for almost half of this mortality profile. Despite this knowledge, so far we have been unable to identify treatable pathogenetic factors among ESRD patients to help reverse these poor cardiovascular outcomes. The difficulty to prognosticate cardiovascular mortality in ESRD remains elusive. However, in 2011, our group, for the first time, had demonstrated that cyclic variations of arterial stiffness as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) before and after hemodialysis determined mortality differences within an ESRD cohort. We have therefore examined the impact of individual patient-level translational PWV changes over time on mortality outcomes in an Italian ESRD cohort.; Study Design and Setting: Prospective observational study, 2007-2010, in an Italian ESRD cohort who underwent in-center outpatient conventional thrice weekly hemodialysis.; Methods: PWV was measured by the foot-to-foot method and repeated after six months. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was measured at 0, 12 and 24 months. Routine clinical data and patient demographics were recorded and mortality outcomes were analyzed.; Results: Between 2007 and 2010, 466 Italian ESRD patients, 229 males and 237 females, age 19-97 (65.6) years, were followed up for 28.9 months. 128 patients (74M:54F) died. The major causes of death were acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 47 (37%) patients (age 70, 26M:21F) and sudden death (SD) in 29 (23%) patients (age 72, 19M:10F). Paired PWV data was available in 308 surviving patients and in 106 patients who died. Baseline PWV was lower in surviving vs dead patients 8.46 +/- 1.8 vs 9.43 +/- 3.75 (p=0.0005). Repeat PWV values were unchanged in the 308 survivors (8.46 +/- 1.8 vs 8.53 +/- 1.85, p=0.5, NS). Repeat PWV values increased in the 106 patients who died from 9.43 +/- 3.75 to 12.11 +/- 4.18 (p<0.0001). Of the 29 patients who died from SD, death occurred <12 hours after the last dialysis (ATLD) in 7, >24 hours ATLD in 20 and >48 hours ATLD in 17. Of the 47 patients who died from AMI, 6 died <12 hours ATLD, 35 died >24 hours ATLD and 23 died >48 hours ATLD. Of the 14 ESRD patients in the cohort that died from hyperkalemia, 3 died <12 hours ATLD, 11 died >24 hours ATLD, and 7 died >48 hours ATLD. CAC data scatter did not allow for adequate statistical subgroup analysis but overall, baseline CAC values were higher in the AMI/SD dead patients vs surviving patients.; Conclusions: This is the first report to show a scalable and direct relationship between translational follow up PWV changes after six months versus observed cardiovascular mortality in an ESRD cohort. We have shown, for the first time, that penultimate PWV, better than baseline PWV, predicted cardiovascular mortality in this ESRD cohort. Moreover, higher proportions of the ESRD deaths from AMI, SD and hyperkalemia occurred during the long inter-dialytic (weekend) period when ESRD patients went for 3 days without hemodialysis. We propose that PWV be monitored among all new ESRD patients, and be repeated after six months of initiation of chronic hemodialysis. Our group had earlier demonstrated in 2012 that daily dialysis reduced PWV in chronic hemodialysis patients. From these study findings, we have proposed that ESRD patients who exhibit elevated initial PWV values, or more so, ESRD patients who demonstrate accelerated PWV values after six months on maintenance chronic hemodialysis should be converted to daily hemodialysis protocol. Furthermore, such patients may require more intense cardiovascular analysis by cardiologists. Further research into new preventative or therapeutic options in this area of ESRD care is warranted.;

AB  - Introduction: Vascular calcification is a common finding in patients (pts) with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).; Objective: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the prevalence and functional effect of native arteriovenous fistula AVF (feeding artery and/or arterialized vein) calcifications evaluated by spiral computed tomography (CT) in ESRD pts undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD).; Patients and Method: Forty-five upper limb AVF (radial 44.4% or brachial 55.6%, mean duration 65.3 +/- 80.9 months) without evidence of significant stenosis were evaluated by CT in 45 ESRD pts (mean age 63.8 +/- 13.1 yr; sex M: 71.1%, F: 28.9%; mean time on HD 53.1 +/- 51.9 months; diabetic nephropathy 15.6%). All AVF explorations were performed using the same multi-slice spiral CT scanner (HiSpeed Dual machine, GE Medical Systems). The severity of AVF calcifications was quantified by CT using the following criteria: grade I absence of calcifications, grade II isolated calcifications (<10 groups of calcification), grade III moderate calcifications (10-20 groups of calcification) and grade IV diffuse calcifications (>20 groups of calcification). Laboratory parameters analyzed: calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone; calcium x phosphorus product was calculated. The same week of CT scanning, we evaluated AVF function measuring the blood flow rate (QA). We determined QA (1559.3 +/- 980.6 ml/min) by the Delta-H method (ABF-mode, HemaMetrics, USA) using the Crit-Line III monitor (68.9%) or by Doppler ultrasound (31.1%) performed by the same radiologist using a 5-8 MHz linear transducer (Sequoia machine, Siemens-Acuson); mean arterial pressure MAP (94.7 +/- 16.3 mmHg) was recorded simultaneous with QA.; Results: Most pts not showed AVF calcification by CT scan (grade I: 27/45, 60%). Forty percent of pts (18/45) demonstrated any degree of AVF calcification (grade II 13.3%, grade III 8.9%, grade IV 17.8%). Pts with brachial AVF showed higher mean QA compared to pts with radial AVF (1899.1 +/- 1131.8 versus 1134.5 +/- 516.4 ml/min, p=0.005), but MAP (91.2 +/- 15.8 versus 99.0 +/- 16.2 mmHg) and the prevalence of AVF calcification (32% versus 50%) were not different between both groups (p=0.11 and p=0.24, respectively). Pts with evidence of any calcification on CT scanning (grade II, III or IV) had higher time on HD (84.6 +/- 63.1 versus 24.6 +/- 20.0 months), higher AVF duration (97.7 +/- 89.3 versus 34.6 +/- 61.2 months) and similar QA (1488.3 +/- 678.9 versus 1606.6 +/- 1148.9 ml/min) compared with pts without AVF calcification (p=0.014, p=0.001 and p=0.69, respectively); no differences in MAP (95.4 +/- 13.8 versus 94.2 +/- 17.9 mmHg), prevalence of brachial AVF (44% versus 63%) or mineral metabolism parameters were found when comparing both groups (for all comparisons, p=NS). The same results were obtained when comparing pts with a high (grade III-IV: 26.7%) and a low (grade I-II: 73.3%) AVF calcification score, or when comparing pts with diffuse (grade IV) and without (grade I) AVF calcification.; Conclusions: 1) The prevalence of AVF calcification by CT scan was 40%. 2) The AVF calcification was related with time on HD and AVF duration. 3) The function of fully developed AVF without stenosis and suitable for routine HD was not impaired by the presence of calcifications.;

AB  - Dialysis patients have bone metabolic disorders and a higher prevalence of fractures, principally peripheral fractures. However, there are few studies focusing on the prevalence of vertebral fractures. Moreover, aortic calcifications are very common and are an independent predictive factor of vascular morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications in haemodialysis (HD) patients (n = 99), in comparison with a random sample of general population of similar age and from the same geographical area (n = 624) and study their relationship with clinical, biochemical and therapeutical data. The prevalence of vertebral fractures in HD patients and general population was 19.1% and 24.1% respectively (non-significant statistical differences). In both, sexes, the presence of vertebral fractures was positively associated with age, mean maximum Ca, mean maximum CaxP. In women, time in HD was positively associated as well. On the other hand, the prevalence of aortic calcifications was much higher in HD patients (77.9% vs 37.5%, p < 0.001). HD was a risk factor for aortic calcification in women [OR = 7.7 (IC 95% = 2.6-22.9)] as in men [OR = 5 (IC 95% = 1.9-12.9)]. Severe vascular calcifications were more frequent in HD patients, it reached 57.4% compared with 17% of general population (p < 0.001). Both, in women (64.5% vs 13.3% p < 0.001) and in men (51.4% vs 20.9%), respectively (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the prevalence of vertebral fractures was similar in HD patients and in general population. Nevertheless, frequency and severity of aortic calcifications was higher in HD patients.;

AB  - Aim: To study the prevalence of and risk factors (RF) associated with cardiovascular system damage in patients with predialysis diabetic and nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD).; Subjects and Methods: The investigation enrolled 317 patients with CKD of various etiologies. In Group 1 (165 patients with CKD: 54% of men, 46% of women; mean age 46 +/- 15 years), the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 37.2 ml/min; the serum creatinine level was 2.9 mg/dl. Group 2 included 152 (41%) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (41% of men and 59% of women; mean age 57.3 +/- 7.1 years). The duration of DM averaged 10.4 +/- 7.1 years. All the patients underwent physical examination; the levels of glycated hemoglobin and adipose tissue hormones, urinary albumin excretion were additionally determined in the diabetic patients. Echocardiography was performed in 172 patients. The influence of populationwide and renal failure-associated RFs on the cardiovascular system was evaluated in CKD.; Results: Clinical and instrumental examinations of 165 patients with Stages II-IV nondiabetic CKD revealed atherosclerosis of the aorta and the vessels of the heart, brain, kidney, and lower extremities in 60 (37%), 35 (24%), 30 (18%), 23 (14%), and 8 (5%), respectively. As atherosclerotic vascular lesion progressed, the incidence of cardiovascular events (CVE) increased. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was diagnosed in 37.3% of the patients with nondiabetic CKD. Along with traditional cardiovascular RFs (age, smoking, gender, arterial hypertension), the renal dysfunction-related factors (anemia, diminished glomerular filtration rate, elevated creatitine levels, and abnormal phosphorus and calcium metabolism) are of importance. An association was found between LVH, atherosclerotic vascular lesion, and heart valve calcification. According to EchoCG data, 36% of the patients with type 2 DM were diagnosed as having LVH. The RFs of the latter were albuminuria, obesity, and abnormal carbohydrate and purine metabolisms. There was an association of diabetic nephropathy with left ventricular remodeling processes and a history of CVE.; Conclusion: The development of cardiorenal syndrome is observed in early-stage CKD and related to both traditional and renal RFs.;

AB  - Unlabelled: AIM. To analyze changes in the serum concentrations of the morphogenetic proteins fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and Klotho, as well as sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted glycoprotein, in relation to the degree of hypertension, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and arterial stiffness in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at its different stages.; Subjects and Methods: Sixty-five patients (33 men and 32 women) aged 20-65 years, including 25 with chronic glomerulonephritis, 15 with tubulointerstitial nephritis, and 25 with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, were examined. A control group consisted of 15 healthy volunteers matched to the study group patients for age and gender. Serum FGF-23 concentrations and blood pressure (BP) were measured in the all subjects. Patients with BPs > 140/80 mm Hg underwent echocardiography, followed by determination of LV mass (LVM) and calculation of LVM index. Vascular circulation, pulse wave velocity, cardiac and vascular calcifications, and vascular functional properties were estimated.; Results: There was a strong direct Correlation between the serum concentration of FGF-23 and the stage of CKD and an inverse correlation between the levels of Klotho and sclerostin and the stage of CKD. As the glomerular filtration rate became lower, the concentration of FGF-23 increased and that of Klotho and sclerostin decreased just in Stage III CKD while hyperphosphatemia and elevated parathyroid hormone levels were noted in Stages IV-V CKD. As CKD progressed, the serum concentrations of Klotho and sclerostin were inversely correlated with the levels of phosphorus and parathyroid hormone. The degree of blood pressure elevation correlated positively with serum FGF-23 concentrations and inversely with Klotho levels. There was no significant correlation of the level of sclerostin with the degree of BP increase. The direct correlation between higher FGF-23 level and higher VLM is most pronounced in hypertensive patients. There was a strong direct relationship between FGF-23 and Klotho levels and a strong inverse relationship between sclerostin levels and pulse wave velocity. Lower Klotho concentrations were associated with the detection rate of calcifications in the heart valves and large arteries (the abdominal aorta). The reduced serum levels of Klotho and sclerostin were also correlated with concentric LV remodeling.; Conclusion: It was demonstrated that there was a clear link between increased serum FGF-23 and decreased Klotho concentration as CKD progressed, and that between arterial stiffness and calcification and myocardial remodelling regardless of traditional risk factors. More experimental and clinical studies are required to clarify the role of sclerostin in CKD.;

U3  - Local Abstract: [Publisher; Russian] Цель исследования. Проанализировать изменения концентрации в сыворотке крови морфогенетических белков FGF-23 и Klotho, а также склеростина (гликопротеин, секретируемый остеоцитами) в зависимости от выраженности артериальной гипертонии, гипертрофии левого желудочка (ЛЖ) сердца и ригидности артерий у больных хронической болезнью почек (ХБП) на разных ее стадиях. Материалы и методы. Обследовали 65 пациентов: 25 с хроническим гломерулонефритом, 15 с тубулоинтерстициальным нефритом, 25 с гипертензивным нефросклерозом - всего 33 мужчины и 32 женщины в возрасте 20-65 лет. В контрольную группу вошли 15 здоровых волонтеров, сопоставимых по возрасту и полу с пациентами основной группы. У всех определяли концентрацию в сыворотке крови FGF-23, измеряли артериальное давление (АД). Больным с АД >140/80 мм рт.ст. проводили эхокардиографию с последующим определением массы миокарда ЛЖ (ММЛЖ) и расчетом индекса ММЛЖ. Оценивали кровоток в сосудах, скорость пульсовой волны, наличие кальцификатов в сердце и сосудах и функциональные свойства сосудов. Результаты. Между концентрацией в сыворотке крови FGF-23 и стадией ХБП выявлена сильная прямая корреляция, между концентрацией Klotho, склеростином и стадией ХБП - обратная корреляция. По мере снижения скорости клубочковой фильтрации (СКФ) концентрация FGF-23 повышалась, а Klotho и склеростина - снижалась уже при ХБП III стадии, в то время как гиперфосфатемия и повышение концентрации паратиреоидного гормона отмечены с IV-V стадии ХБП. Концентрации в сыворотке крови Klotho и склеростина по мере прогрессирования ХБП обратно коррелировали с уровнем фосфора и паратиреоидного гормона. Степень повышения АД позитивно коррелировала с концентрацией FGF-23 и обратно - с уровнем Klotho. Существенной корреляции уровня склеростина со степенью повышения АД не получено. Прямая связь между повышенным уровнем FGF-23 и увеличением ММЛЖ наиболее выражена у пациентов с АГ. Выявлена сильная корреляция: прямая между уровнем FGF-23 и уровнем Klotho и обратная между уровнем склеростина и скоростью пульсовой волны. Сниженная концентрация Klotho ассоциирована с частотой обнаружения кальцификатов в клапанах сердца и крупных артериях (абдоминальная аорта). Снижение концентрации в сыворотке крови Klotho и склеростина также коррелировало с ремоделирования миокарда ЛЖ концентрического типа. Заключение. Продемонстрирована четкая взаимосвязь повышенной FGF-23 и сниженной концентрации в сыворотке крови Klotho по мере прогрессирования ХБП, а также жесткостью и кальцификацией артерий, ремоделированием миокарда, независимо от наличия традиционных факторов риска. Для верификации роли склеростина при ХБП требуются дополнительные экспериментальные и клинические исследования.

AB  - Unlabelled: Osteocalcin (OC) is witamino-K dependent calcium-binding protein comprising three gamma carboxy glutamic acid residues (Gla) which determines a strong bond with hydroxyapatite. In vitamin K deficiency and/or increased bone resorption undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu-OC) appears in the blood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of Glu-OC and markers of bone metabolism and their impact on coronary artery calcification in patients with end-stage renal failure treated with repeated hemodialysis. The study included 68 patients (29 women and 39 men) aged 60.3 +/- 12.3 years hemodialysis period 24.5 +/- 4.8 months. Control group consisted of 35 healthy volunteers comparable in terms of age and gender. CACS was evaluated based on multislice spiral computed tomography (MSCT). Measurement of carboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-OC) and Glu-OC, bone alkaline phosphatase (bALP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5) were assessed by ELISA and iPTH by Nichols method. Present study demonstrated that the Gla-OC and Glu-OC in hemodialysis patients were significantly higher than the control group 116.37 +/- 70.01 ng/ml and 93.72 +/- 112.63 ng/ml versus 19.51 +/- 3.78 ng/ml and 4.88 +/- 2.63 ng/ ml; p <0.001. Glu-OC level correlated significantly with iPTH, bALP, TRAP5 (p <0.001) and CaSc (p <0.014).; Conclusions: 1. The results indicate a significant correlation between Glu-OC and assessed markers of bone metabolism. 2. Research has indicated a link between bone metabolism and the degree of calcification in the coronary arteries.;

AB  - Background: Expression of bone proteins resulting from transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblasts suggests that vascular calcifications are a bioactive process. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) could play a key role in bone-vascular calcification imbalance and could be a marker of vascular calcification extent and progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate relationships between vascular risk biomarkers (including classic risk factors and OPG) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) extent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and to establish within the markers the appropriate cut-off value to predict CAC.; Methods: A total of 133 non-dialyzed CKD patients at various stages of kidney disease [75 males/58 females, median age: 69.9 (27.4-94.6)] were enrolled, excluding extrarenal replacement therapy patients. All underwent chest multidetector computed tomography for CAC scoring. Blood samples were collected for measurement of vascular risk markers (kidney disease, inflammation, nutrition, calcium phosphate and OPG). A potential relationship between CAC and these biological markers was investigated, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was designed thereafter to identify a cut-off value of involved markers that best predicted the presence of CAC.; Results: After adjustment for age, diabetes, smoking and gender, among biological markers, only low-estimated glomerular filtration rate using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [OR = 3.63 (1.10-12.02)], high FEPO(4) [OR = 3.99 (1.17-13.6)] and high OPG levels [OR = 8.54 (2.14-34.11)] were associated with the presence of CAC. A protective effect of 1.25(OH)(2) vitamin D [OR = 0.20 (0.05-0.79)] and LDL cholesterol [OR = 0.27 (0.08-0.94)] on CAC was also observed. ROC curve analysis showed that the OPG best cut-off value predicting CAC was 757.7 pg/mL.; Conclusion: These results suggest that a CAC increase is strongly associated with a plasma OPG increase in CKD patients. The values of OPG >757.7 pg/mL allow us to predict the presence of CAC in these patients.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality rates in chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23 levels and impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC. Therefore, their relative contribution to abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was examined in patients CKD stages 3-4.; Methods: Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila Index (KI), were studied in 178 patients.; Results: In multivariate linear analysis, AAC associated positively with age, male gender, CKD-stage, presence of carotid plaques (CP) and also with FGF23, but negatively with fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP). Intriguingly, FEP increased with similar slopes with elevations in PTH, with reductions in GFR, and also with elevations in FGF23 but the latter only in patients with none (KI = 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack of a FEP-FGF23 correlation in patients with severe AAC (KI > 5) suggested a role for an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 but not to PTH in AAC. Logistic and zero-inflated analysis confirmed the independent association of age, CKD stage, male gender and CP with AAC, and also identified a threshold FEP/FGF23 ratio of 1/3.9, below which the chances for a patient of presenting severe AAC increased by 3-fold. Accordingly, KI remained unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9 but markedly increased in parallel with further reductions in FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9.; Conclusions: In CKD 3-4, an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 with FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9 associates with severe AAC independently of age, gender or CP.;

AB  - Purpose: Vascular calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and predicts poor patient outcomes. While computed tomography is the gold standard for evaluation of vascular calcification, plain radiograph offers a simpler and less costly alternative. The calcification of abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral arteries has been evaluated by plain radiograph, but the data on their outcome predictabilities are still limited. The present study investigated the role of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and pelvic arterial calcification (PAC) in predicting overall morality in non-dialysis CKD stages 2-5 (CKD 2-5), maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and long-term kidney transplant (KT) patients.; Methods: Four hundred and nineteen patients were included. Lateral abdominal and pelvic radiographs were obtained. The degree of AAC and PAC was evaluated according to the methods described previously by Kaupplia et al. and Adragao et al. Patients were followed prospectively for 5 years.; Results: AAC and PAC scores correlated well with the correlation coefficients of 0.442 for CKD 2-5, 0.438 for HD and 0.586 for KT (p < 0.001). Patients with AAC score > 6 or PAC score > 1 were older, showed higher prevalence of DM and had higher serum phosphate and PTH but lower serum albumin and eGFR. A more severe degree of AAC was associated with an increase in KT duration, whereas a more severe degree of PAC was associated with worsening kidney function and prolonged dialysis vintage. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed AAC score > 6 as a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in CKD 2-5 but not in HD or KT, whereas PAC score > 1 was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in all three populations. After adjusting for age, the predictability of AAC was lost, whereas PAC remained an independent predictor of mortality in all three populations. Adjustments for cardiovascular and CKD risk factors including age, gender, BMI, DM, serum albumin, calcium and phosphate attenuated the predictability of PAC in HD but not in CKD 2-5 or KT patients.; Conclusion: PAC was better than AAC in predicting mortality in CKD, HD and KT patients.;

AB  - Objective: This study assesses the association between abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and renal function of living kidney donors and evaluate AAC as a surrogate marker for nephrosclerosis.; Methods: Between January 2010 and March 2013, 287 donors who underwent living donor nephrectomy were enrolled. We analyzed computed tomography angiographies and quantified AAC scores by calculating the Agatston score for the abdominal aorta. The donors were stratified into the non-AAC group (AAC score = 0; n = 238) and the AAC group (AAC score >0; n = 49). The relationship between AAC and perioperative estimated glomerular filtration rate was analyzed. For the 180 donors consenting to implantation biopsy, the nephrosclerosis score was defined as the sum of abnormalities, including glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and arteriosclerosis.; Results: The mean AAC score was 185.5 ± 263.3 in the AAC group. The AAC group was older than the non-AAC group (51.1 ± 6.1 vs 37.9 ± 11 years; P < .001). Perioperative renal function was not different between the 2 groups. However, among the AAC group, donors with an AAC score of >100 were associated with delayed renal function recovery (P = .035). Donors with AAC were more likely to have glomerulosclerosis (50.0% vs 29.1%; P = .022), tubular atrophy (62.5% vs 33.1%; P = .002), and a higher nephrosclerosis score (P = .002).; Conclusions: Living donors with an AAC score of >100 require close observation because they have a higher probability of delayed renal function recovery after donation. AAC is associated with nephrosclerosis in healthy adults.; Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients and plays an important role in their poor survival. Early identification of these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce mortality. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated with CAD in autopsy studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a lateral lumbar X-ray we hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray might be predictive of the presence of significant CAD in dialysis patients.; Methods: All patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial without a history of CABG or a PCI with stent implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified using a previously validated scoring system whereupon the association between AAC and the presence of significant CAD was assessed.; Results: A total of 90 patients were included in this study (71% male, 67 ± 7 years old). Forty-six patients were found to have significant CAD. AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with CAD (10.1 ± 4.9 vs 6.3 ± 4.6 (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that AAC score is an independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold higher risk per point increase (p < 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD.; Conclusion: This study shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray is predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening method could contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further screening of CAD.; Trial Registration: NTR948 , registered 10-4-2007 ; ISRCTN20479861 , registered 2-5-2007.;

AB  - Introduction:: Several histologic features have been identified in the upper-extremity arteries and veins of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, which may affect arteriovenous fistula maturation. However, it is unclear whether these chronic kidney disease vascular features are abnormal.; Methods:: We obtained upper-extremity arterial and venous specimens from 125 advanced chronic kidney disease patients undergoing arteriovenous fistula creation and from 15 control subjects. We quantified medial fibrosis, micro-calcification, and intimal hyperplasia with appropriate histology stains. We characterized medial collagen fiber configuration in second-harmonic-generation microscopy images for the fiber anisotropy index and the dominant fiber direction.; Results:: The advanced chronic kidney disease patients were significantly younger than control subjects (53 ± 14 years vs 76 ± 11 years, p < 0.001). After controlling for age, the chronic kidney disease patients had greater arterial medial fibrosis (69% ± 14% vs 51% ± 10%, p < 0.001) and greater arterial micro-calcification (3.03% ± 5.17% vs 0.01% ± 0.03%, p = 0.02), but less arterial intimal thickness (30 ± 25 µm vs 63 ± 25 µm, p < 0.001), as compared to control subjects. The anisotropy index of medial collagen fibers was lower in both arteries (0.24 ± 0.10 vs 0.44 ± 0.04, p < 0.001) and veins (0.28 ± 0.09 vs 0.53 ± 0.10, p < 0.001) in chronic kidney disease patients, indicating that orientation of the fibers was more disordered. The dominant direction of medial collagen fibers in chronic kidney disease patients was greater in the arteries (49.3° ± 23.6° vs 4.0° ± 2.0°, p < 0.001) and the veins (30.0° ± 19.6° vs 3.9° ± 2.1°, p < 0.001), indicating that the fibers in general were aligned more perpendicular to the lumen.; Conclusion:: Advanced chronic kidney disease is associated with several abnormalities in vascular histology and collagen fiber configuration. Future research is needed to investigate whether these abnormalities affect the maturation outcomes of arteriovenous fistulas.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification and low bone turnover with a relatively low parathyroid hormone (PTH) often coexist in diabetic patients undergoing haemodialysis. Since calcium salts (CaS) are used extensively as primary phosphate binders and have been associated with progressive vascular calcification, we studied the effects of CaS on coronary arteries and parathyroid activity in incident haemodialysis diabetic patients.; Methods: We measured the change in coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) with sequential electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) in 64 diabetic and 45 non-diabetic patients, randomized to CaS or sevelamer within 90 days of starting haemodialysis. CACS measurements were repeated after 6, 12 and 18 months. Serum intact PTH (iPTH), calcium and phosphorus were serially tested.; Results: During the study period, serum phosphate was similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Serum calcium levels were similar at baseline (2.3+/-0.25 mmol/l for both) and increased significantly with CaS treatment (P<0.05) both in diabetic and non-diabetic patients but not with sevelamer. Diabetic patients treated with CaS showed a significantly greater CACS progression than sevelamer-treated patients (median increase 177 vs 27; P=0.05). During follow-up, diabetic patients receiving CaS were significantly more likely to develop serum iPTH values<16 pmol/l than diabetic patients treated with sevelamer (33% vs 6%, P=0.005) and had a lower mean iPTH level (24+/-16 vs 31+/-14 pmol/l; P=0.038).; Conclusions: The management of hyperphosphataemia with CaS in haemodialysis diabetic patients is associated with a significantly greater progression of CACS than with sevelamer. These effects are accompanied by iPTH changes suggestive of low bone turnover.;

AB  - Background: We hypothesized that high-dose active vitamin D therapy in the form of alphacalcidol (α-calcidol), used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease, could lead to vascular calcification and accelerated progression of aortic stiffness.; Methods: We conducted an observational study in 85 patients on chronic hemodialysis, among which 70 were taking a weekly dose of α-calcidol of <2 µg and 15 were taking a weekly dose of ≥2 µg (pharmacological dose). Parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23, and α-klotho were determined. Aortic stiffness was assessed by determination of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV) at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 1.2 years. A multivariable regression model was used to evaluate the impact of pharmacological dose of α-calcidol on the progression of aortic stiffness.; Results: At baseline, clinical, biological, and hemodynamic parameters were similar. At follow-up, cf-PWV increased more in patients with pharmacological dose of α-calcidol (0.583±2.291 m/s vs. 1.948±1.475 m/s; P = 0.04). After adjustment for changes in mean blood pressure and duration of follow-up, pharmacological dose of α-calcidol was associated with a higher rate of progression of cf-PWV (0.969 m/s; 95% confidence interval = 0.111-1.827; P = 0.03), and this association persisted after further adjustments for parameters of mineral metabolism.; Conclusions: In this study, pharmacological dose of α-calcidol was associated with accelerated progression of aortic stiffness. This study suggest that the vascular safety of active vitamin D posology may need to be specifically addressed in the treatment of chronic kidney disease-related bone mineral disorder.; © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2014.

AB  - Introduction: The correction of metabolic acidosis caused by renal failure is achieved by adding bicarbonate during dialysis. In order to avoid the precipitation of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate that takes place in the dialysis fluid (DF) when adding bicarbonate, it is necessary to add an acid, usually acetate, which is not free of side effects. Thus, citrate appears as an advantageous alternative to acetate, despite the fact that its acute effects are not accurately known.; Objective: To assess the acute effect of a dialysis fluid containing citrate instead of acetate on acid-base balance and calcium-phosphorus metabolism parameters.; Material and Methods: A prospective crossover study was conducted with twenty-four patients (15 male subjects and 9 female subjects). All patients underwent dialysis with AK-200-Ultra-S monitor with SoftPac® dialysis fluid, made with 3 mmol/L of acetate and SelectBag Citrate®, with 1 mmol/L of citrate and free of acetate. The following were measured before and after dialysis: venous blood gas monitoring, calcium (Ca), ionic calcium (Cai), phosphorus (P) and parathyroid hormone (PTH).; Results: Differences (p<0.05) were found when using the citrate bath (C) compared to acetate (A) in the postdialysis values of: pH, C: 7.43 (0.04) vs. A: 7.47 (0.05); bicarbonate, C: 24.7 (2.7) vs. A: 27.3 (2.1) mmol/L; base excess (BEecf), C: 0.4 (3.1) vs. A: 3.7 (2.4) mmol/L; corrected calcium (Cac), C: 9.8 (0.8) vs. A: 10.1 (0.7) mg/dL; and Cai, C: 1.16 (0.05) vs. A: 1.27 (0.06) mmol/L. No differences were found in either of the parameters measured before dialysis.; Conclusion: Dialysis with citrate provides better control of postdialysis acid-base balance, decreases/avoids postdialysis alkalaemia, and lowers the increase in Cac and Cai. This finding is of special interest in patients with predisposing factors for arrhythmia and patients with respiratory failure, carbon dioxide retention, calcifications and advanced liver disease.; Copyright © 2015.

AB  - Vascular calcification is a frequent complication of uremic patients. In addition to classical risk factors such as age, male gender, smoking, inflammation, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, which also exist in the general population, patients with chronic renal failure have other risk factors such as oxidative stress, inflammation, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and overtreatment with calcium and vitamin D. These latter risk factors may even have a better predictive value than classical risk factors for coronary heart disease in uremic patients.; Copyright 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Bone changes in 138 patients under hemodialysis were evaluated by radiological methods. Bone mass as was assessed by clavicular score was reduced in patients with chronic renal failure compared with control subjects, especially in male patients, and showed the gradual decrease with aging in both sexes. The incidence of disappearance of lamina dura and that of vascular calcification increased with aging in chronic renal failure. Although serum PTH did not show much difference among various age groups, serum CT and calcium were significantly elevated in 20--24 years of age group compared with other age groups. The etiology of decrease of bone mass in male subjects was discussed from the standpoint of decreased gonadal activity.;

AB  - Background: Extracellular pyrophosphate is a potent endogenous inhibitor of vascular calcification, which is degraded by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and generated by hydrolysis of ATP via ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (eNPP1). ALP activity (as routinely measured in clinical practice) represents the maximal activity (in ideal conditions), but not the real activity (in normal or physiological conditions). For the first time, the present study investigated extracellular pyrophosphate metabolism during hemodialysis sessions (including its synthesis via eNPP1 and its degradation via ALP) in physiological conditions.; Methods and Findings: 45 patients in hemodialysis were studied. Physiological ALP activity represents only 4-6% of clinical activity. ALP activity increased post-hemodialysis by 2% under ideal conditions (87.4 ± 3.3 IU/L vs. 89.3 ± 3.6 IU/L) and 48% under physiological conditions (3.5 ± 0.2 IU/L vs. 5.2 ± 0.2 IU/L). Pyrophosphate synthesis by ATP hydrolysis remained unaltered post-hemodialysis. Post-hemodialysis plasma pH (7.45 ± 0.02) significantly increased compared with the pre-dialysis pH (7.26 ± 0.02). The slight variation in pH (~0.2 units) induced a significant increase in ALP activity (9%). Addition of phosphate in post-hemodialysis plasma significantly decreased ALP activity, although this effect was not observed with the addition of urea. Reduction in phosphate levels and increment in pH were significantly associated with an increase in physiological ALP activity post-hemodialysis. A decrease in plasma pyrophosphate levels (3.3 ± 0.3 μmol/L vs. 1.9 ± 0.1 μmol/L) and pyrophosphate/ATP ratio (1.9 ± 0.2 vs. 1.4 ± 0.1) post-hemodialysis was also observed.; Conclusion: Extraction of uremic toxins, primarily phosphate and hydrogen ions, dramatically increases the ALP activity under physiological conditions. This hitherto unknown consequence of hemodialysis suggests a reinterpretation of the clinical value of this parameter.;

AB  - Objective: We evaluated short-term prognosis and resource utilization of consecutive patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as a function of fluoroscopy time.; Background: Advances in interventional cardiology are reflected in the growing complexity of PCI leading to an increasing use of fluoroscopic guidance. The relationship between fluoroscopy time and in-hospital outcomes after PCI has not been addressed.; Methods: In a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database including a total of 9,650 patients, the mean fluoroscopy time was 18.3 +/- 12.2 minutes. Outcomes were stratified by fluoroscopy time.; Results: Compared to patients within the 75th percentile, those with prolonged fluoroscopy time were older and had a higher prevalence of prior coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral arterial disease, type B2/C lesions, and baseline TIMI flow 0-2. Patients with prolonged fluoroscopy time had higher rates of in-hospital death (3.3% vs. 0.3%; p <0.0001), emergent CABG (2.1% vs. 0.3%; p = 0.0001), stent thrombosis (2.9% vs. 1.3%; p = 0.17), retroperitoneal hematoma (0.9% vs. 0.2%; p = 0.01), and contrast-induced nephropathy (6.7% vs. 4.5%; p = 0.03). Resource utilization was significantly higher (p <0.0001) in patients with prolonged fluoroscopy time. By multivariate analysis, prolonged fluoroscopy time was most strongly associated with prior CABG (OR = 2.39), ostial lesion (OR = 2.87), severe lesion calcification (OR = 2.14), baseline TIMI flow 0-2 (OR = 3.71) (all p <0.0001), lesion eccentricity (OR = 1.96; p = 0.0063), and peripheral arterial disease (OR = 1.91; p = 0.0068).; Conclusions: Prolonged fluoroscopy time is associated with higher complexity of treated lesions and increased rates of periprocedural complications including early mortality, emergent CABG, contrast-induced nephropathy, and increased resource utilization.;

AB  - The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on function and structure of the aorta was studied in the Lewis polycystic kidney (LPK) rat model of cystic renal disease and Lewis controls. Pulse-wave velocity (PWV) was recorded under urethane anesthesia (1.3 g/kg ip) in mixed-sex animals aged 6 and 12 wk and in 12-wk-old animals treated with perindopril (3 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) po) from age 6-12 wk. Tail-cuff systolic pressures were recorded over the treatment period. After PWV measurements, animals were euthanized and the aorta was removed for histomorphological and calcium analysis. Hypertension in LPK at 6 and 12 wk was associated with a shift of the PWV curve upward and to the right, indicating a decrease in aortic compliance, which was significantly reduced by perindopril. LPK demonstrated greater aortic calcification (6 wk: 123 ± 19 vs. 65 ± 7 and 12 wk: 406 ± 6 vs. 67 ± 6 μmol/g, P < 0.001, LPK vs. Lewis, respectively). This was reduced by treatment with perindopril (172 ± 48 μmol/g, 12 wk LPK P < 0.001). Medial cross-sectional area and elastic modulus/wall stress of the aorta were greater in LPK vs. Lewis control animals at 6 and 12 wk of age and showed an age-related increase that was prevented by treatment with perindopril (P < 0.001). Perindopril also ameliorated the degradation of elastin, increase in collagen content, and medial elastocalcinosis seen in 12-wk LPK. Overall, perindopril improved the structural and functional indices of aortic stiffness in the LPK rats, demonstrating a capacity for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition to limit vascular remodeling in chronic kidney disease.;

AB  - Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured in the aorta, right leg and arm of 90 control subjects (CS) and 92 hemodialysis patients (HD) of the same age and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Blood chemistry, including blood lipids, and echographic dimensions of the aorta, were measured in all subjects. Presence of aortic calcification was evaluated by abdominal X-ray and echography. Whereas femoral and brachial PWV were only slightly increased in HD (P less than 0.05), the aortic PWV was significantly elevated (1113 +/- 319 cm/sec) in comparison with CS (965 +/- 216 cm/sec; P = 0.0016). Aortic diameters were larger in HD, both at the root of aorta (32.7 +/- 4 vs. 28.2 +/- 2.8 mm; P less than 0.0001) and aortic bifurcation (16.9 +/- 3.1 vs. 14.6 +/- 2.2 mm; P less than 0.0001). Although the MAP was similar in HD (109.9 +/- 19.3 mm Hg) and CS (110.2 +/- 17.2 mm Hg), the pulse pressure was significantly increased in HD patients (76.6 +/- 23.7 vs. 63.9 +/- 22 mm Hg; P = 0.007). In the two populations, aortic PWV was found to increase with age (P less than 0.0001) and MAP (P less than 0.0001). The presence of aortic calcification showed only a borderline relationship with the increase in aortic PWV (P = 0.050 in CS and P = 0.069 in HD). As change in PWV is directly related to change in distensibility, and the aortic diameters were increased in HD, these results indicate that aortic wall compliance is decreased in HD, resulting in an increase in the pulsatile component of arterial pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS);

AB  - Studies on aortic arch calcification (AAC) and mortality risk in maintenance dialysis patients have yielded conflicting findings. We conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the association between the presence of AAC and cardiovascular or all-cause and mortality risk in maintenance dialysis patients. Observational studies evaluating baseline AAC and cardiovascular or all-cause mortality risk in maintenance dialysis patients were searched through the PubMed and Embase, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang databases until January 2016. A total of 8 studies with 3,256 dialysis patients were identified. Compared with patients without AAC, the presence of AAC was associated with greater risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard risk [HR] 2.30; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.78-2.97) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.44; 95% CI 1.19-1.75). Subgroup analyses indicated that the pooled HR for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was 2.31 (95% CI 1.57-3.40) and 1.45 (95% CI 1.08-1.96) for the grade 2/3 AAC. Peritoneal dialysis patients with AAC had greater cardiovascular (HR 3.93 vs. HR 2.10) and all-cause mortality (HR 2.36 vs. HR 1.33) than hemodialysis patients. The AAC appears to be independently associated with excessive cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in maintenance dialysis patients. Regular follow-up AAC might be helpful to stratify mortality risk in dialysis patients.;

AB  - Background/aim: Vascular calcification is associated with cardiovascular risk in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Previous reports have shown that simple assessment of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) using plain radiography is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the general population. We conducted a prospective study to investigate factors associated with the presence at baseline and progression of AoAC in MHD patients and examined its prognostic value in a short-term outcome.; Methods: We prospectively evaluated chest X-rays in 301 asymptomatic MHD patients. The extent of AoAC was divided into three Grades (0, 1, 2+3). Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and biochemical data were assessed and the patients were then followed for 3 years.; Results: AoAC was observed in 126 patients (41.9%) as Grade 0, in 112 patients (37.2%) as Grade 1, and in 63 patients (20.9%) as Grade 2 and 3 at baseline. An increase in the severity of calcification was associated with older male patients who had lower serum albumin levels. During the follow-up period of 3 years, multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients with AoAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis and the grade of AAC also influenced their survival. Moreover, all-cause death rates were significantly higher in the progression groups than in the non-progression groups.; Conclusions: The presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest X-ray were independently associated with mortality in MHD patients. Regular follow-up by chest X-ray could be a simple and useful method to stratify mortality risk in MHD patients.;

AB  - Introduction: In the presence of severe aorto-iliac calcification, aortic bypass surgery can be mandatory to allow kidney transplantation. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and outcomes of this strategy among asymptomatic patients.; Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the files of all patients that had undergone vascular bypass surgery prior to kidney transplantation between November 2004 and March 2016. All patients undergoing aortic bypass surgery prior to kidney transplantation without any vascular-related symptoms were included.; Results: Twenty-one asymptomatic patients were included. Ten patients (48%) have not received a kidney transplant. Four patients died before kidney transplantation, including 2 deaths related to the bypass surgery (9.5%). Early post-operative morbidity involved 11 cases. Eleven patients (52%) were transplanted. Transplanted patients were significantly younger (median age 60 [56-61] vs 67 [60-72] years, P = .04) at the time of bypass and were less frequently treated for coronary heart disease (9% vs 50%, P = .06).; Conclusion: Aortic bypass surgery performed prior to kidney transplantation among asymptomatic patients has significant mortality and morbidity rates. When transplantation is possible, the results are satisfying. Larger studies are required to define the selection criteria, such as age and coronary heart disease.; © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification and reduced bone density are prevalent in chronic kidney disease and linked to increased cardiovascular risk. The mechanism is unknown. We assessed the relationship between vascular calcification, femoral bone density and left ventricular mass in patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease in a cross-sectional observational study.; Methodology and Principal Findings: A total of 120 patients were recruited (54% male, mean age 55 ± 14 years, mean glomerular filtration rate 50 ± 13 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed using lateral lumbar spine radiography and was present in 48%. Mean femoral Z-score measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was 0.60 ± 1.06. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine left ventricular mass. One patient had left ventricular hypertrophy. Subjects with aortic calcification had higher left ventricular mass compared to those without (56 ± 16 vs. 48 ± 12 g/m(2), P = 0.002), as did patients with femoral Z-scores below zero (56 ± 15 vs. 49 ± 13 g/m(2), P = 0.01). In univariate analysis presence of aortic calcification correlated with left ventricular mass (r = 0.32, P = 0.001); mean femoral Z-score inversely correlated with left ventricular mass (r = -0.28, P = 0.004). In a multivariate regression model that included presence of aortic calcification, mean femoral Z-score, gender and 24-hour systolic blood pressure, 46% of the variability in left ventricular mass was explained (P<0.001).; Conclusions: In patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, lower mean femoral Z-score and presence of aortic calcification are independently associated with increased left ventricular mass. Further research exploring the pathophysiology that underlies these relationships is warranted.;

AB  - Background: Certain metabolic disorders, such as hyperphosphatemia induce vascular calcification in haemodialysis patients; it is unclear, however, whether these disorders contribute to aortic calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients. This study examined the risk factors of aortic calcification in a large number of haemodialysis patients, and compared risk factors between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.; Methods: The subjects were 667 patients on maintenance haemodialysis: 184 with type 2 diabetes and 483 without. Aortic calcification was measured semi-quantitatively using a plain computed tomography image of the abdominal aorta, and an aortic calcification index (ACI) was calculated.; Results: The ACI of the diabetic subjects was significantly higher than that of those without diabetes (57.3+/-22.1 vs 44.8+/-28.3%, P < 0.0001), although the dialysis vintage of the former was significantly shorter (P < 0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed that diabetes was a significant independent risk factor for increased ACI. Multiple regression analyses, performed separately in diabetics and non-diabetics, revealed that advanced age, higher systolic blood pressure, smoking and longer haemodialysis vintage were common independent risk factors significantly associated with increased ACI in both patient groups (R2 = 0.296, P < 0.0001 for non-diabetics; R2 = 0.193, P < 0.0001 for diabetics). Higher serum phosphate concentration was not significantly associated with increased ACI in diabetic patients (P = 0.429), although it was a significant independent factor in non-diabetic patients (beta = 0.150, P < 0.0005).; Conclusion: Aortic calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients is more advanced, compared with non-diabetic patients, even with short haemodialysis vintage. Since disorders of mineral metabolism are not significantly associated with aortic calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients, aortic calcification in these patients could be affected by metabolic abnormalities associated with the diabetic state per se, independent of other confounding factors; and aortic calcification may be advanced even before haemodialysis induction.;

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among renal transplant recipients. Aortic calcification is associated with increased mortality in dialysis subjects. The significance of aortic calcification among renal transplant recipients is unknown. Our objective was to prospectively examine the association of aortic calcification with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality among asymptomatic incident renal transplant recipients.; Methods: One hundred and twelve renal transplant recipients underwent electron beam computed tomography. Aortic calcification was scored by the Agatston method. The mean follow-up time was 5.1 years. Cardiovascular events (heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke) and all-cause mortality were recorded.; Results: The cohort consisted of 62% Caucasians, 38% African Americans and 62% male gender. The mean age was 49.0 +/- 12.5 years. Thirty-four percent had aortic calcification. During follow-up, 12 cardiovascular events and 10 deaths were recorded. Subjects with aortic calcification had more cardiovascular events compared to those without aortic calcification (23.7 versus 4.1%, P = 0.001). Recipients with aortic calcification had higher mortality compared to those without aortic calcification but it did not reach statistical significance (15.8 versus 5.4%, P = 0.07). The univariate hazard ratio of aortic calcification score in a proportional hazard Cox model to assess event-free survival was 1.15 (1.04-1.27, P = 0.01). Diabetes and aortic calcification score were independently associated with survival. In addition to the predictors above, dialysis vintage was an independent predictor for combined future cardiovascular event and mortality.; Conclusions: In conclusion, aortic calcification is prevalent among renal transplant recipients and is predictive of future cardiovascular events. Aortic calcification is easily identified by non-invasive testing, and should be considered when assessing cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic renal transplant recipients.;

AB  - Renal transplant recipients have an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease. Arterial stiffness (AS) and aortic calcifications (ACs) are well-known CV risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of AS and AC in incident renal transplant recipients (RTRs). We conducted a prospective study in 253 single RTR. AC were scored by means of lumbar X-ray. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed in a subgroup of 115 patients. AC were present in 61% of patients. After a mean follow-up of 36 months, 32 CV events occurred in the overall group and 13 events in the PWV subgroup. When we accounted for age, gender, and CV history, AC score (HR, hazard ratio 1.09 per 1 unit increase; 95% CI 1.02-1.17) and PWV (HR 1.45 per 1 m/s; 95% CI 1.16-1.8) remained an independent predictor of CV events in Cox-regression analyses. Using receiver operating characteristics, the area under the curve for predicting CV events amounted to 0.80 and 0.72 for sum AC and PWV, respectively. Both AS and AC are strong predictors of future CV events in an incident RTR population. These vascular assessments are readily available and easy to perform, making them ideal tools for further risk stratification. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00547040).; © 2013 Steunstichting ESOT.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the presence and extent of cardiac calcifications and aortic stiffness in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).; Patients and Methods: The study group consisted of 60 patients with ESRD with a mean age of 51.7 years, treated with peritoneal dialysis. In all patients transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to assess the following parameters: left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), interventricular septum end-diastolic diameter (IVSDd), posterior wall end-diastolic diameter (PWDd), ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), aortic maximal and minimal diameter, aortic valve area, mitral valve area (MVA), left ventricular ejection time (LVET), maximal aortic velocity. Aortic stiffness index (AS) was calculated. Aortic and mitral valve calcifications were assessed.; Results: Patients with ESRD had a larger left ventricle (LVEDd 5.4 cm vs. 4.76 cm) and its wall was thicker (IVSDd 1.36 cm vs. 1.02 cm; PWDd 1.31 cm vs. 0.94 cm). Patients had poorer left ventricle contractility (EF 56.1 vs. 61.6%; FS 28.5 vs. 33.2%). Atherosclerotic plaques, calcified plaques and valvular calcifications were more frequently detected in patients with ESRD. Patients with ESRD had significantly higher values of the AS index: (5.34 vs. 3.24). Among ESRD subjects with the stiffer aorta, atherosclerotic plaques including calcificones and the aortic valve damage were more frequently detected.; Conclusions: Patients with ESRD are characterized by increased aortic stiffness. Atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta as well as cardiac and large vessels calcifications are more common among patients with ESRD. In patients with ESRD there is a correlation between an increase in aortic stiffness and damage of aortic valvular leaflets as well as calcifications of atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta. The degree of aortic stiffness is not related to impairment of mitral valvular leaflets and extravalvular calcifications. A relationship between aortic stiffness and aortic or aortic valve calcifications suggest a different pathogenesis of aorta calcification as compared to that underlying calcifications of other localizations.;

AB  - Increased aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV) reflects increased arterial stiffness and is a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We examined functional and structural correlations among PWV, aortic calcification, and vascular remodeling in a rodent model of CKD, the Lewis polycystic kidney (LPK) rat. Hemodynamic parameters and beat-to-beat aortic PWV were recorded in urethane-anesthetized animals [12-wk-old hypertensive female LPK rats (n = 5)] before the onset of end-stage renal disease and their age- and sex-matched normotensive controls (Lewis, n = 6). Animals were euthanized, and the aorta was collected to measure calcium content by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. A separate cohort of animals (n = 5/group) were anesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium and pressure perfused with formalin, and the aorta was collected for histomorphometry, which allowed calculation of aortic wall thickness, medial cross-sectional area (MCSA), elastic modulus (EM), and wall stress (WS), size and density of smooth muscle nuclei, and relative content of lamellae, interlamellae elastin, and collagen. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PWV were significantly greater in the LPK compared with Lewis (72 and 33%, respectively) animals. The LPK group had 6.8-fold greater aortic calcification, 38% greater aortic MCSA, 56% greater EM/WS, 13% greater aortic wall thickness, 21% smaller smooth muscle cell area, and 20% less elastin density with no difference in collagen fiber density. These findings demonstrate vascular remodeling and increased calcification with a functional increase in PWV and therefore aortic stiffness in hypertensive LPK rats.;

AB  - Objective: The objective of our study was to assess whether the degree and distribution of iliac artery calcifications as determined by a CT-based calcium scoring system correlates with outcomes after renal transplant.; Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of renal transplant recipients who underwent CT of the pelvis within 2 years before surgery yielded 131 patients: 75 men and 56 women with a mean age of 52 years. Three radiologists assigned a separate semiquantitative score for calcification length, circumferential involvement, and morphology for the common iliac arteries and for the external iliac arteries. The operative and clinical notes were reviewed to determine which iliac arterial segment was used for anastomosis, the complexity of the operation, and whether delayed graft function (DGF) occurred. Renal allograft survival and patient survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique.; Results: Excellent interobserver agreement was noted for each calcification score category. The common iliac arteries showed significantly higher average calcification scores than the external iliac arteries for all categories. Advanced age and diabetes mellitus were independently predictive of higher scores in each category, whereas hypertension, cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, and sex were not. Based on multivariate analysis, only the calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis was independently predictive of a higher rate of surgical complexity and of DGF. None of the scores was predictive of graft or patient survival. However, patients with CT evidence of iliac arterial calcification had a lower 1-year survival after transplant than those who did not (92% vs 98%, respectively; p = 0.05).; Conclusion: Only the calcification morphology score of the arterial segment used for anastomosis was significantly predictive of surgical complexity and of DGF. Routine pretransplant CT for calcification scoring in patients of advanced age or those with diabetes mellitus may enable selection of the optimal artery for anastomosis to optimize outcomes.;

AB  - Objective: In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), aortic calcification is more frequent and severe and it is also predictive of adverse cardiovascular outcome. The aim of the present study was to characterize aortic calcification in renal compared with non-renal patients.; Methods: Aortas of 31 patients with advanced CKD and of 31 age-and gender-matched controls were obtained at autopsy. Calcium and phosphorus content in the aorta was quantitated using x-ray analysis. The expression of calcification-promoting and calcification-inhibiting proteins was assessed using immunohistochemistry.; Results: The calcium and phosphorus content of the aorta was higher in CKD patients than in controls. Even in non-calcified aortic specimens of CKD, staining for Msx-2, BMP-2, bone sialo-protein, TNF-alpha and nitrotyrosine was significantly more marked compared to controls. The same proteins were immunodetected in calcified aortic specimens of both CKD and controls. In contrast, staining for transglutaminase-2 and Fetuin A was significantly reduced in CKD. Higher expression of cbfa-1 and Pit-1 was observed in all calcified aortas with no difference between CKD and controls. The expression of TNF-alpha, phospho-p38 and Msx-2 was correlated to the intensity of upregulation of BMP-2 and osteoblastic transdifferentiation by VSMC even in non-calcified areas of the aortas of CKD.; Conclusion: The expression of markers characteristic for calcification is not different in calcified aorta of CKD patients compared to controls, but in CKD patients, evidence of inflammation, transformation to an osteoblastic phenotype and reduced expression of transglutaminase are also found even in non-calcified aorta.;

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine if significant differences in plaque composition exist between the popliteal and tibial vessels in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Forty-four patients with PAD required either above-knee (n = 38), below-knee (n = 5), or through-knee (n = 1) amputation for pedal sepsis/gangrene. The 51 vessels (anterior tibial, n = 9; posterior tibial, n = 10; peroneal, n = 3; popliteal, n = 29) were obtained and underwent intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) evaluation ex vivo within 24 hr of amputation. Sequential IVUS data were obtained at known intervals throughout the vessel length and then analyzed with radiofrequency techniques for quantification of plaque composition, plaque volume, and total vessel volume. Plaque composition was categorized as fibrous, fibro-fatty, necrotic core, and dense calcium. Clinical data were obtained via review of electronic records at the time of amputation. Two-sided t-tests were performed to compare components within each plaque. Results are expressed as mean percentage +/- standard error of the mean. Tibial vessels had more dense calcium within these plaques than popliteal arteries (33.8 +/- 5.6% vs. 10.6 +/- 1.9%, p < 0.001). Consequently, distal vessels had less fibro-fatty and fibrous plaque than popliteal arteries (7.7 +/- 1.4% vs. 13.1 +/- 1.2%, p < 0.005; 42.4 +/- 4.7% vs. 61.4 +/- 2.2%, p < 0.001, respectively). Necrotic core plaque composition was found to be similar when comparing tibial versus popliteal arteries (16.1% vs. 14.9%, p = nonsignificant). Clinical factors including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and chronic renal insufficiency were not associated with plaque composition differences using a univariate analysis. As we progress distally in the arterial tree of patients with PAD, calcium plaque content increases with decreasing burden of fibro-fatty plaque. Clinical and demographic factors, with the exception of smoking, were not found to be associated with atherosclerotic plaque composition.;

AB  - Objective: A low ankle-brachial index is associated with cardiovascular disease and reduced arterial compliance. A high ankle-brachial index is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. We tested the hypothesis that subjects with a high ankle-brachial index demonstrate a lower arterial compliance. In addition, we assessed whether pulse pressure amplification is increased among subjects with a high ankle-brachial index.; Methods: We studied 6814 adults enrolled in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis who were, by definition, free of clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline. Differences in total arterial compliance (ratio of stroke volume to pulse pressure), aortic and carotid distensibility (measured with magnetic resonance imaging and duplex ultrasound, respectively) were compared across ankle-brachial index subclasses (≤0.90, 0.91-1.29; ≥1.30) with analyses adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical atherosclerosis.; Results: Peripheral arterial disease was detected in 230 (3.4%) and high ABI in 648 (9.6%) of subjects. Those with high ankle-brachial index demonstrated greater aortic/radial pulse pressure amplification than those with a normal ankle-brachial index. In adjusted models aortic and carotid distensibility as well as total arterial compliance, were lowest among those with ankle-brachial index≤0.9 (p<0.01 vs. all), but were not reduced in subjects with an ankle-brachial index≥1.3.; Conclusion: Lower aortic, carotid and total arterial compliance is not present in subjects free of overt cardiovascular disease and with a high ankle-brachial index. However, increased pulse pressure amplification contributes to a greater ankle-brachial index in the general population and may allow better characterization of individuals with this phenotype.; Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Several risk factors for arterial calcification have been reported but controversial. The aim of this study was to clarify the interactions among chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and dyslipidemia in altering the risk of arterial calcification in the three different arterial locations and the intramural location at the internal carotid artery (ICA) origins. Calcified burdens at the ICA origins, the aortic arch, and its orifices were evaluated in a retrospective fashion by using computed tomography angiography in 397 patients. The multivariate analyses were adjusted for age, gender, CKD, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and current smoking status. Additionally, subgroup analyses in each variable were conducted. Our multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that CKD was significantly associated with the outside-wall calcification at the ICA origins, whereas DM was only associated with the inside-ICA-wall calcification. Additionally, we found that DM increased the association between CKD and arterial calcification at the aortic arch and its orifices, and the outside-wall at the ICA origins. Hypertension was significantly associated with the calcification at the orifices of the aortic arch branches synergistically with CKD. Dyslipidemia did not have any significant association with calcification in any of the three vascular beds. CKD had the highest prevalence risk of calcification in common with the three different vascular beds. CKD in combination with DM, as well as hypertension in combination with CKD, were key relationships affecting the risk of arterial calcification, especially at the aortic arch and its orifices.;

AB  - Background: Cross-sectional and follow-up studies on end-stage renal disease patients showed that arterial calcifications are associated with cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and are an independent predictor of all-cause and CV mortality. However, these studies did not examine the impact on prognosis according to the type of calcification, i.e. intimal vs medial. Arterial media calcification (AMC), a non-occlusive condition, affects haemodynamics differently from arterial intima calcification (AIC), which occurs in atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of AMC in relationship to all-cause or CV mortality for stable haemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods: We included 202 such patients in the present study. At baseline, soft-tissue native radiograms of the pelvis and the thigh were analysed for the presence and type (AMC vs AIC) of arterial calcifications. All patients underwent B-mode ultrasonography of the common carotid artery to determine the presence of atherosclerotic calcified plaques, measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity and echocardiography.; Results: AIC was usually observed in older patients with a clinical history of atherosclerosis before starting HD treatment and typical risk factors associated with atherosclerotic disease. AMC was observed in young and middle-aged patients without conventional atherosclerotic risk factors. AMC was closely associated with the duration of HD and calcium-phosphate disorders, including the oral dose of elemental calcium prescribed as phosphate binder (CaCO(3)). Compared to patients with AIC, patients with AMC had a longer survival, but in turn their survival was significantly shorter than that of patients without calcifications.; Conclusions: AMC is a strong prognostic marker of all-cause and CV mortality in HD patients, independently of classical atherogenic factors. The principal effect of AMC on arterial function is increased arterial stiffness.;

AB  - Vascular calcification, albeit heterogeneous in terms of biological and physicochemical properties, has been associated with ageing, lifestyle, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unknown whether or not moderately impaired renal function (CKD stages 2-4) affects the physiochemical composition and/or the formation of magnesium-containing tricalcium phosphate ([Ca,Mg](3)[PO(4)](2), whitlockite) in arterial microcalcification. Therefore, a high-resolution scanning X-ray diffraction analysis (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France) utilizing histological sections of paraffin-embedded arterial specimens derived from atherosclerotic patients with normal renal function (n = 15) and CKD (stages 2-4, n = 13) was performed. This approach allowed us to spatially assess the contribution of calcium phosphate (apatite) and whitlockite to arterial microcalcification. Per group, the number of samples (13 vs. 12) with sufficient signal intensity and total lengths of regions (201 vs. 232 μm) giving rise to diffractograms ("informative regions") were comparable. Summarizing all informative regions per group into one composite sample revealed calcium phosphate/apatite as the leading mineral phase in CKD patients, whereas in patients with normal renal function the relative contribution of whitlockite and calcium phosphate/apatite was on the same order of magnitude (CKD, calcium phosphate/apatite 157 μm, whitlockite 38.7 μm; non-CKD, calcium phosphate/apatite 79.0 μm, whitlockite 94.1 μm; each p < 0.05). Our results, although based on a limited number of samples, indicate that chronic impairment of renal function affects local magnesium homeostasis and thus contributes to the physicochemical composition of microcalcification in atherosclerotic patients.;

AB  - Vascular calcification of the coronary arteries or aorta is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular outcome, but clinical significance of arterial micro-calcification (AMC) of vascular access is unclear in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Sixty-five patients awaiting vascular access operation were enrolled. We compared surrogate markers of cardiovascular morbidity such as aortic arch calcification (AoAC) by chest radiography, arterial stiffness by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and endothelial dysfunction by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) between patients with and without AMC of vascular access on von Kossa staining. AMC of vascular access was detected in 36 (55.4%). The AMC-positive group had significantly higher incidence of AoAC (63.9% vs. 20.7%, p < 0.001) and higher baPWV (26.5 ± 9.4 m/s vs. 19.8 ± 6.6 m/s, p = 0.006) than the AMC-negative group. There was no significant difference in FMD between the two groups (5.4 ± 2.6% vs. 5.7 ± 3.5%, p = 0.764). The AMC-positive group had higher incidence of diabetes mellitus, higher systolic blood pressure and wider pulse pressure than the AMC-negative group. This study suggests that AMC of vascular access may be associated with cardiovascular morbidity via AoAC and arterial stiffness in HD patients.; © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Most studies have focused on evaluating the association between the presence of small bowel vascular lesions (SBVLs) and patients' comorbidities.; Aims: We sought to uncover a more fundamental indicator that may predict the presence of SBVLs by considering atherosclerosis qualitatively and quantitatively.; Methods: We enrolled 79 consecutive patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding who had undergone computed tomography (CT) and capsule endoscopy or double-balloon endoscopy from January 2015 to June 2017. The SBVL frequency, type, and location, and the relationship between the presence of SBVLs and the patients' clinical characteristics were evaluated. Arterial wall calcification was assessed on unenhanced CT images, and a modified Agatston scoring system was used to determine the abdominal aorta calcium scores.; Results: Of the 27 (34%) patients with SBVLs, 15 (19%) had type 1a, 12 (15%) had type 1b, and 2 (3%) had type 2a SBVLs. Most of the lesions were located in the jejunum. Cardiovascular disease (P = .017), chronic kidney disease (P = .025), and arteriosclerosis (P = .0036) were associated with the presence of SBVLs. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that arteriosclerosis (odds ratio [OR] 7.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-143.9) and superior mesenteric artery calcification (OR 16.3; 95% CI 3.64-118.6) were independent predictors of the presence of SBVLs. The modified Agatston score was significantly higher in SBVL cases than in non-SBVL cases (6384 vs. 2666, P = .0023).; Conclusions: Arteriosclerosis, especially increased superior mesenteric artery calcification, is associated with an increased likelihood of SBVLs.;

AB  - Background: Dialysis patients have increased vascular calcification of the coronary arteries and aorta by electron beam CT scan. The purpose of the present study was to utilize an alternative machine, spiral CT, to assess calcification in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.; Methods: Two groups of patients with ESRD were evaluated: group 1, those receiving a renal transplant (n=38); and group 2, those remaining on dialysis (n=33). All patients underwent quad-slice spiral CT with retrospective gating to evaluate coronary artery and aorta calcification scores. Both area (Agatston method) and volume calculations were utilized, with retrospective gating in all but 16 subjects. Laboratory tests, medications and clinical characteristics were analysed.; Results: Using spiral CT, the intra-reader variability for coronary artery calcification (after correction for very low scores) was 0.9% mean / 0% median using the area (Agatston method) and 2.9% mean / 0% median using volume calculations. Group 1 patients were younger, more likely to be Caucasian and on peritoneal dialysis, had lower serum calcium and higher C-reactive protein levels than group 2. In patients without vs those with coronary artery calcification, only longer duration of dialysis (34+/-64 vs 55+/-50 months, P=0.004; r=0.39, P=0.005) and increasing age (39+/-13 vs 54+/-10 years, P<0.001; r=0.29, P=0.039) were associated, whereas only increasing age was associated with aorta calcification.; Conclusion: In ESRD patients, the factors correlating with coronary calcification were duration of dialysis and advancing age, whereas only age correlated with aorta calcification. Spiral CT offers an alternative technique for the assessment of these changes.;

AB  - Patients with end-stage renal disease have a very high prevalence and extent of arterial calcification. A number of studies suggest that similar pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for development and progression of calcification of atherosclerotic plaque and bone formation. Fetuin-A is a potent calcification inhibitor and is expressed in bone, with not-yet well-defined functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between bone mineral densitometry parameters, coronary artery calcification, and serum fetuin-A levels. In a cross-sectional design, we included 72 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Serum fetuin-A levels were studied both in maintenance HD patients and healthy controls. Maintenance HD patients had radius, hip, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) measured by electron-beam computed tomography. The associations between site-specific BMD parameters, CACS, and serum fetuin-A levels were studied in maintenance HD patients. CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries were significantly higher in patients with a T-score below -2.5 than above in the proximal region of the radius, neck and trochanter of the femur, and the lumbar spine. Mean serum fetuin-A concentration was 0.636 +/- 0.118 g/L in maintenance HD patients and it was less than healthy controls (0.829 +/- 0.100 g/L, P < 0.0001). CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries correlated significantly with the serum fetuin-A levels. Moreover, significant positive correlations were shown between the serum fetuin-A levels, BMD values, and T-scores of proximal radius, neck, and trochanter of the femur, but not with the lumbar spine. The present study demonstrates an association between serum fetuin-A levels, coronary artery calcification, and bone mineral densities--except for the lumbar spine, in maintenance HD patients. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the cross-sectional design of the study.;

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in kidney and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients. Assessing abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), using lateral spine x-rays and the Kaupilla 24-point AAC (0-24) score, may identify transplant recipients at higher CV risk.; Methods: Between the years 2000 and 2015, 413 kidney and 213 SPK first transplant recipients were scored for AAC at time of transplant and then followed for CV events (coronary heart, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease), graft-loss, and all-cause mortality.; Results: The mean age was 44 ± 12 years (SD) with 275 (44%) having AAC (26% moderate: 1-7 and 18% high: ≥8). After a median of 65 months (IQR 29-107 months), 46 recipients experienced CV events, 59 died, and 80 suffered graft loss. For each point increase in AAC, the unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) for CV events and mortality were 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) and 1.11 (1.08-1.15). These were similar after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, transplant type, dialysis vintage, and diabetes: aHR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.12) and 1.09 (1.04-1.13). For recipients with high versus no AAC, the unadjusted and fully-adjusted HRs for CV events were 5.90 (2.90-12.02) and 3.51 (1.54-8.00), for deaths 5.39 (3.00-9.68) and 3.38 (1.71-6.70), and for graft loss 1.30 (0.75-2.28) and 1.94 (1.04-3.27) in age and smoking history-adjusted analyses.; Conclusion: Kidney and SPK transplant recipients with high AAC have 3-fold higher CV and mortality risk and poorer graft outcomes than recipients without AAC. AAC scoring may be useful in assessing and targeted risk-lowering strategies.; © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification is associated with mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. AST-120, which adsorbs uremic toxins, is reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and death in chronic kidney disease patients. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association between abdominal aortic calcification and the use of AST-120 in predialysis chronic kidney disease patients.; Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted including 199 predialysis chronic kidney disease patients (stages 4 and 5) who underwent abdominal plain computed tomography in our institution between 2005 and 2010. Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed by aortic calcification index (ACI). Patients were divided into two groups based on whether or not AST-120 was administered for at least six months, and ACI was compared between the two groups.; Results: The aortic calcification index was significantly lower in patients taking AST-120 [12.2 (2.5-30.3) vs. 25.7 (13.4-45.3) %, P < 0.001]. According to multivariate linear regression analysis, the use of AST-120 was independently and significantly correlated with ACI after adjusting for confounding factors.; Conclusions: The use of AST-120 was independently associated with less aortic calcification in predialysis chronic kidney disease patients.;

AB  - Background: Despite marked advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the coronary slow flow phenomenon (CSFP), the exact mechanism remains unclear. Previous studies have suggested that CSFP might be associated with generalized atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and low-grade chronic inflammation. High serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels are associated with vascular calcification, atherosclerotic disease, and an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, the relationship between ALP and CSFP is unclear.; Methods: We investigated 64 patients with angiographically proven CSFP and 50 with normal coronary flow. Serum ALP levels were measured in all studied individuals.; Results: Serum ALP levels in patients with CSFP were significantly higher than those in the control group (70.5 ± 17.1 vs. 61.9 ± 16.1 U/L, P = 0.007). A positive association was observed (r = 0.42, P = 0.032) between serum ALP levels and the mean thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame count (mTFC). Regression analysis showed a high serum ALP level was the only independent predictor of the mTFC (β = 0.309, P < 0.001). Moreover, our study showed that a serum ALP level > 67.5 U/L was a predictor of CSFP (sensitivity = 83.3%, specificity = 84.1%).; Conclusions: Patients with CSFP show high serum ALP levels, which may be associated with the pathogenesis of CSFP. A high serum ALP level is a predictor of CSFP. Future studies are needed to clarify the role of ALP in patients with CSFP.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in type 2 diabetes, and is associated with cardiovascular complications. Recent preclinical data suggest that metformin inhibits VC both in vitro and in animal models. However, metformin's effects in patients with diabetic VC have not previously been characterized. The present study investigated the association between metformin use and lower-limb arterial calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk.; Methods: The DIACART cross-sectional cohort study included 198 patients with type 2 diabetes but without severe chronic kidney disease. Below-the-knee calcification scores were assessed by computed tomography and supplemented by colour duplex ultrasonography. Data on anti-diabetic drugs were carefully collected from the patients' medical records and during patient interviews. Biochemical and clinical data were studied as potential confounding factors.; Results: Metformin-treated patients had a significantly lower calcification score than metformin-free patients (mean ± standard deviation: 2033 ± 4514 and 4684 ± 9291, respectively; p = 0.01). A univariate analysis showed that metformin was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of severe below-the-knee arterial calcification (p = 0.02). VC was not significantly associated with the use of other antidiabetic drugs, including sulfonylureas, insulin, gliptin, and glucagon like peptide-1 analogues. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the association between metformin use and calcification score (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.11-0.98]; p = 0.045) was independent of age, gender, tobacco use, renal function, previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes duration, neuropathy, retinopathy, HbA1c levels, and inflammation.; Conclusions: In patients with type 2 diabetes, metformin use was independently associated with a lower below-the-knee arterial calcification score. This association may contribute to metformin's well-known vascular protective effect. Further prospective investigations of metformin's potential ability to inhibit VC in patients with and without type 2 diabetes are now needed to confirm these results.;

AB  - Background/aims: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors associated with AoAC and analyzed the relationship between the factors including bone-derived biomarkers and AoAC.; Methods: We enrolled 389 stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using chest-X ray examination. Demographic data was collected in addition to serum levels of biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23).; Results: Two hundred sixteen patients (55.5%) had AoAC. Patients with AoAC score ≥ 4 were older, with a higher percentage being male, and exhibited lower serum levels of albumin and triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely associated with AoAC severity, and FGF-23was directly related to vascular calcification. Age, gender, and dialysis vintage were independent predictors of AoAC.; Conclusion: MHD patients have a high prevalence of AoAC. The grade of AoAC was dependent on older age in association with longer dialysis vintage. Levels of circulating FGF-23 but not sclerostin were related to AoAC severity. Serum FGF-23 levels were independently associated with AoAC.; © 2018 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is one of the factors associated with cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recommendations concerning screening for VC differ. Possible ability to prevent and reversibility of VC are major subjects on debate whether screening for VC could improve outcomes of renal patients. The objective of the study was to evaluate the significance of simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) based on plane radiographic films and to test its association with non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients on chronic HD.; Methods: A study population consisted of 95 prevalent HD patients in the HD unit of Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health sciences Kaunas Clinics. Clinical data and laboratory tests information were collected from medical records. SVCS was evaluated as it is described by Adragao et al. After measurement of VC, HD patients were observed for novel non-fatal cardiovascular events.; Results: Patients were divided into two groups: SVCS≥3 (57 patients [60%]) and <3 (38 patients [40%]). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves show a significant difference in non-fatal cardiovascular events in the group with SVCS≥3 vs. <3 group (26.3% vs. 7.8%; log rank 5,49; P=0.018). Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed a negative impact of VC, hyperphosphatemia, and lower ejection fraction on cardiovascular events. No statistically significant differences were observed comparing parameters of Ca-P metabolism disorders between groups with different SVCS. On separate analysis, the presence of VC in hands was also associated with higher rate of novel cardiovascular events (score 0 goup-5 events [10.6%] vs. score≥1 group-13 events [27%], log rank P=0.035).; Conclusion: VC assessed by simple and inexpensive radiological method was an independent predictor of novel non-fatal cardiovascular events in HD patients.; Copyright Â© 2016 Association Société de néphrologie.

AB  - Introduction: A very low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (VLPL) is associated with an increased risk of adynamic bone disease, vascular calcification, and mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the frequency, the associated factors, and the prognosis of non-surgical VLPL in a cohort of prevalent HD patients.; Methods: In July 2005, a cross-sectional study was performed on the French ARNOS cohort in 1,348 prevalent HD patients from 24 dialysis centres in the Rhône-Alpes area. Patients with a baseline intact PTH level <50 pg/ml (VLPL, Group 1) and ≥ 50 pg/ml (Group 2) were compared and a 42-month survival analysis was performed. Patients with prevalent or incident parathyroidectomy were excluded.; Results: We studied 1,138 prevalent HD patients. As compared to patients of Group 2 (n = 1,019), patients with VLPL (Group 1, n = 119) had lower serum albumin levels (34.5 ± 5 vs. 36.4 ± 5 g/l, p < 0.0001), less protein intake (nPCR 0.99 ± 0.28 vs. 1.1 ± 0.28 g/kg/day, p = 0.01), higher calcaemia (2.30 ± 0.2 vs. 2.26 ± 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.01) and were more frequently treated with calcium carbonate (67 vs. 54%, p < 0.001). Patients with VLPL had a higher mortality rate (HR: 1.4 (1.07-1.8), p = 0.006) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, and dialysis vintage. The odds ratios of mortality for patients with VLPL remained higher in all calcaemia and serum albumin quartiles. Only 3/119 patients in Group 1 did not receive any PTH-lowering therapies (i.e. calcium carbonate (67%), alfacalcidol (38%), cinacalcet (10.1%), and dialysate calcium ≥ 1.5 mmol/l (94%)).; Conclusion: In this observational French cohort, VLPL was observed in 10% of prevalent HD patients and was associated with poor survival rates. An inadequate therapeutic strategy could be responsible for this observation. The real consequences of this iatrogenic adynamic bone disease remain hypothetical, but it may be related to the risk of developing vascular calcification. It is hypothesized that a more adequate strategy, using fewer PTH-lowering therapies in cases of VLPL, may help in improving the poor prognosis.; Copyright © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Peripheral artery occlusive disease and vascular calcification are highly prevalent in hemodialysis (HD) patients, however the association of the combination of ankle-brachial index (ABI) and aortic arch calcification (AoAC) with clinical outcomes in patients undergoing HD is unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the combination of ABI and AoAC is independently associated with overall and cardiovascular mortality in HD patients. The median follow-up period was 5.7 years. Calcification of the aortic arch was assessed by chest X-ray. Forty-seven patients died including 24 due to cardiovascular causes during the follow-up period. The study patients were stratified into four groups according to an ABI < 0.95 or ≥0.95 and an AoAC score of >4 or ≤4 according to receiver operating characteristic curve. Those with an ABI < 0.95 and AoAC > 4 (vs. ABI ≥ 0.95 and AoAC score ≤ 4) were associated with overall (hazard ratio [HR], 4.913; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.932 to 12.497; p = 0.001) and cardiovascular (HR, 3.531; 95% CI, 1.070 to 11.652; p = 0.038) mortality in multivariable analysis. The combination of a low ABI and increased AoAC was associated with increased overall and cardiovascular mortality in patients undergoing HD.;

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in CKD and leads to increased vascular stiffness and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors include abnormal bone turnover and/or dysregulation of the calcification inhibitors, although their relative contribution remains unclear. We investigated the association between bone turnover, the calcification inhibitors (matrix gla protein; MGP and Fetuin-A), and the phosphate regulating hormone; fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD patients. One hundred and forty-five patients with CKD stages 1-4 (74 M, 71 F) aged (mean [SD]) 53 [14] years were studied. Bone turnover markers (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 were determined. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), forearm (FARM) and total hip (TH). Arterial stiffness was assessed by contour analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a significant positive correlation between TRACP:BALP ratio and SI(DVP) ( r=0.19, p=0.023). Following multi-linear regression analysis, significant associations were seen between serum BALP (p=0.037), TRACP (p=0.009) and TRACP:BALP ratio (p=0.001) and SI(DVP) independently of traditional CVD risk factors. No significant relationship between SI(DVP) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 was observed. A significant negative correlation was seen between BMD at the FARM and SI(DVP) in CKD stage 4 (r=-0.35, p=0.024). The association remained significant following correction for age, gender and cardiovascular risk factors (p=0.029). Our data suggest a link between imbalances in bone turnover and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of these bone turnover markers as predictors of CVD in CKD.; Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The cardiovascular risk factors that contribute to coronary calcification have been extensively studied while those related to tibial artery calcium are less well defined. We sought to determine the associations between cardiovascular risk factors and tibial artery calcification in a cohort of patients with and without significant peripheral atherosclerosis. A total of 222 patients without end-stage renal disease were identified in a prospectively maintained database containing tibial artery calcification (TAC) scores, and demographic, cardiovascular, and biochemical risk factor information. Patients with prevalent tibial artery calcification were more likely to be older, male, and have a history positive for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and tobacco use. Patients with an abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) or symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) were also more likely to have higher calcium values. In analyses using multivariable logistic regression, age, gender, diabetes, and tobacco use maintained their association with prevalent tibial calcification while hypertension, hyperlipidemia and body mass index did not. These associations remained when PAD was added to the model. After adjusting for relevant cardiovascular risk factors, we found that only abnormal ABI, current PAD symptoms, and lower serum calcium values were associated with the presence of tibial artery calcification. In conclusion, in patients without end-stage renal disease, tibial artery calcification has risk factors that are similar but not identical to those for coronary artery calcification and peripheral atherosclerosis.; © The Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Long-term hemodialysis patients are prone to an exceptionally high burden of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The novel temperature-based technology of digital thermal monitoring (DTM) of vascular reactivity appears associated with the severity of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic population. We hypothesized that in hemodialysis patients, the DTM and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score have a gradient association that follows that of subjects without kidney disease. We examined the cross-sectional DTM-CAC associations in a group of long-term hemodialysis patients, and their 1:1 matched normal counterpart. Area under the curve for temperature (TMP-AUC), the surrogate of the DTM index of vascular function, was assessed after a 5-minute arm-cuff reactive hyperemia test. Coronary calcium score was measured via electron beam computed tomography or multidetector computed tomography scan. We studied 105 randomly recruited hemodialysis patients (age: 58 ± 13 years, 47% men) and 105 age- and gender-matched controls. In hemodialysis patients vs. controls, TMP-AUC was significantly worse (114 ± 72 vs. 143 ± 80, P = 0.001) and CAC score was higher (525 ± 425 vs. 240 ± 332, P < 0.001). Hemodialysis patients were 14 times more likely to have CAC score >1000 as compared with controls. After adjustment for known confounders, the relative risk for case vs. control for each standard deviation decrease in TMP-AUC was 1.46 (95% confidence interval: 1.12-1.93, P = 0.007). Vascular reactivity measured via the novel DTM technology is incrementally worse across CAC scores in hemodialysis patients, in whom both measures are even worse than their age- and gender-matched controls. The DTM technology may offer a convenient and radiation-free approach to risk-stratify hemodialysis patients.; © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Serum fetuin A has been shown to be associated with the risk of vascular calcification and atherosclerosis, and it can predict the onset of cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is an accessible and reliable method to identify the subclinical atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between dialysate calcium concentrations and fetuin A or cIMT in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Forty patients, newly diagnosed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and undergoing peritoneal dialysis, were enrolled in the study, with a calcium content of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution of 1.25 mmol/L in 20 patients (low-Ca group) and 1.75 mmol/L in 20 patients (standard-Ca group). The patients were followed up for 12 months after the PD conducted. Serum fetuin A was determined using a human fetuin A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and cIMT was detected using ultrasonic wave. We observed no difference between two groups with regard to the baseline data of fetuin A, cIMT, calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product, high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), or lipid parameters. After 12 months follow-up, fetuin A (263.92 ± 16.1 vs. 282.76 ± 21.0, p = 0.017) and calcium-phosphorus product (39.85 ± 7.76 vs. 47.50 ± 6.65, p = 0.009) were obviously lower in the low-Ca group than standard-Ca group, the other serum parameters were not different between these two groups. Compared with baseline data, serum fetuin A concentration significantly reduced in low-Ca group ( p < 0.05). The number of patients with increased cIMT and newly occurring cardiovascular events in the low-Ca group were significantly reduced than standard-Ca group ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, our data suggest that low calcium dialysate treatment is associated with the decreased serum fetuin A concentration and serum calcium-phosphorus product, and it is associated with the reduced number of PD patients with increased cIMT or with newly occurring cardiovascular events. However, more studies with lager sample size should be performed in the future.;

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease--mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) are associated with vascular calcification and abnormal electrolytes that lead to cardiovascular disease and mortality. CKD-MBD is identified by imbalances in serum calcium (Ca), phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Although the relation of phosphate and PTH with the prognosis of HF patients has been reported, the association of Ca with prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) and CKD remains unclear.; Methods and Results: We examined 191 patients admitted for HF and CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL min(-1) 1.73 m(-2)), and they were divided into 2 groups based on levels of corrected Ca: low Ca (Ca <8.4 mg/dL; n = 32) and normal-high Ca (8.4 ≤Ca; n = 159). We compared laboratory and echocardiographic findings, as well as followed cardiac and all-cause mortality. The low-Ca group had 1) higher levels of alkaline phosphatase (308.9 vs. 261.0 U/L; P = .026), 2) lower levels of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (26.1 vs. 45.0 pg/mL; P = .011) and hydrogen carbonate (22.4 vs. 24.5 mmol/L; P = .031), and 3) a tendency to have a higher PTH level (87.5 vs. 58.6 pg/mL; P = .084). In contrast, left and right ventricular systolic function, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein, phosphate, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and zinc did not differ between the 2 groups. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, cardiac and all-cause mortality were significantly higher in the low-Ca group than in the normal-high-Ca group (P < .05). In the multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, hypocalcemia was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in HF and CKD patients (P < .05).; Conclusions: Hypocalcemia was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in HF and CKD patients.; Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification is the most prominent underlying pathological finding in patients with uraemia, and is a predictor of mortality in this population. Fetuin-A (alpha2-Heremans Schmid glycoprotein; AHSG) is an important circulating inhibitor of calcification in vivo, and is downregulated during the acute-phase response. We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that AHSG deficiency is directly related to uraemic vascular calcification.; Methods: We did a cross-sectional study in 312 stable patients on haemodialysis to analyse the inter-relation of AHSG and C-reactive protein (CRP) and their predictive effect on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, over a period of 32 months. Subsequently, we tested the capacity of serum to inhibit CaxPO4 precipitation in patients on long-term dialysis (n=17) with apparent soft-tissue calcifications, and in those on short-term dialysis (n=8) without evidence of calcifications and cardiovascular disease.; Findings: AHSG concentrations in serum were significantly lower in patients on haemodialysis (mean 0.66 g/L [SD 0.28]) than in healthy controls (0.72 [0.19]). Low concentrations of the glycoprotein were associated with raised amounts of CRP and with enhanced cardiovascular (p=0.031) and all-cause mortality (p=0.0013). Sera from patients on long-term dialysis with low AHSG concentrations showed impaired ex-vivo capacity to inhibit CaxPO4 precipitation (mean IC50: 9.0 microL serum [SD 3.1] vs 7.5 [0.8] in short-term patients and 6.4 [2.6] in controls). Reconstitution of sera with purified AHSG returned this impairment to normal. Interpretation AHSG deficiency is associated with inflammation and links vascular calcification to mortality in patients on dialysis.

AB  - Unlabelled: Two matrix Gla protein (MGP) polymorphisms were associated with progression of aortic calcification and femoral neck bone loss in men. All these findings were also functionally corroborated in two vascular and bone in vitro systems indicating that MGP genetic variations can be partly responsible of higher risk of bone loss and vascular calcification.; Introduction: MGP plays an important role in bone and vascular mineralization as confirmed by MGP-deficient murine model. We therefore aimed to find a genetic association among -138T>C, -7G>A, and Thr83Ala MGP single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), bone loss, and progression of aortic calcification in a randomly selected general population of 296 individuals who participated in the European Vertebral Osteoporosis Study.; Methods: To evaluate the rate of change in bone mineral density (BMD) and the progression of aortic calcification, dual X-ray absorptiometry and lateral spine X-rays were performed at baseline and after 4 years of follow-up. Genotyping for the three polymorphisms was carried out using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length analysis. In addition, functional studies of MGP-7G>A and Thr83Ala SNPs were performed on transiently transfected osteoblast-like UMR-106 and vascular smooth muscle A7r5 cells.; Results: The proportion of men who had lost BMD in the femoral neck was higher among homozygous -7AA and 83Ala-Ala (p = 0.039 and p = 0.009, respectively), and also featured a higher risk of progression of aortic calcifications (OR = 5.6, 95% CI = 1.2-27.8 and OR = 6.8, 95% CI = 1.4-32.3, respectively). No effect was observed in women. The MGP-7A allele produced a reduction in luciferase activity compared to MGP-7G: 47% less in vascular cells and 34% less in bone cells (p = 0.001 and 0.012, respectively). In vascular cells under calcifying conditions, the MGP 83Thr allele showed a slightly higher, although not significant, inhibition than the MGP 83 Ala allele in calcium content suggesting functional differences between both variants.; Conclusion: These results suggest that MGP genetic variations could predict a higher risk of bone loss and progression of vascular calcification in men.;

AB  - Background: Arterial calcification is a common problem in patients with chronic kidney disease, and has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The goal of the present study was to evaluate whether pelvic artery calcifications are associated with technical failure of arteriovenous thigh grafts in haemodialysis patients.; Methods: From 1 January 1999 to 30 June 2002, thigh grafts were placed in 54 haemodialysis patients who had exhausted all options for permanent vascular access in the upper extremities. Perioperative computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained in 32 of the patients for diagnostic purposes unrelated to vascular access planning. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the graft outcomes, scored the vascular calcifications on CT of the distal aorta, common iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries on a semi-quantitative 5-point scale. The association between technical graft failure (inability to complete the anastomosis) and the vascular calcification score was analysed.; Results: There was a high inter-observer agreement in scoring vascular calcification (kappa = 0.801). Among 26 patients with absent or mild pelvic arterial calcifications (grade 1-2) on CT, none (0%) experienced technical graft failure. In contrast, three of six patients (50%) with moderate to severe calcification (grade 3-5) had technical graft failures (P = 0.004 by Fisher's exact test). The cumulative 1 year graft patency was lower in the group with grade 3-5 calcification (33 vs 81%, P = 0.09). The two groups were similar in age, gender, race, diabetes, duration of dialysis, serum calcium, serum phosphorus and serum parathyroid hormone.; Conclusion: There is a strong association between pelvic artery calcifications and technical failure of thigh grafts. The presence of moderate to severe vascular calcification is predictive of poor cumulative 1 year graft patency.;

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent data implicate disordered bone and mineral metabolism, including changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and fetuin A, as novel risk factors for arterial calcification. The potential role of calcitonin, another hormonal regulator of mineral and bone metabolism, has not been studied in detail.; Materials and Methods: We investigated the link between serum calcitonin and the total burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) using the validated Gensini score, in a cross-sectional study of 88 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) between 46 and 87 ml/min/1.73 m² who underwent coronary angiography. We evaluated the associations between serum calcitonin, minerals (calcium, phosphate), calcium × phosphate product, and other factors that regulate mineral metabolism (intact PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D, FGF-23, and fetuin A) and the severity of CAD.; Results: The mean serum calcitonin was 11.5 ± 7.8 pg/ml. In univariate analysis, the Gensini CAD severity score correlated significantly with male gender, eGFR, and serum levels of 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF-23, fetuin A, and calcitonin (R = 0.474, P = 0.001 for the latter). In multivariate analysis adjusted for calcium, phosphate, 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF 23, fetuin A, and calcitonin, only calcitonin (β = 0.20; P = 0.03), FGF-23, fetuin A, and 25-OH-vitamin D emerged as independent predictors of Gensini score. In the second step, we adjusted for the presence of traditional risk factors, proteinuria, and GFR. After these adjustments, the FGF-23 and fetuin A remained statistically significant predictors of the Gensini score, while calcitonin did not.; Conclusions: Our study suggests that, in addition to other well-known components of mineral metabolism, increased calcitonin levels are associated with greater severity of CAD. However, this relation was not independent of traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. Longitudinal studies in larger populations including patients with more advanced CKD are needed.;

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) and linked to arterial calcification. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein coupled receptor, plays a pivotal role in extracellular calcium homeostasis and is expressed in the intimal and medial layers of the arterial wall. We investigated whether common CASR gene variants are predictors for aortic and coronary artery calcification or influence risk factors such as serum calcium, phosphate and glucose concentrations in RTRs.; Methods: Two hundred and eighty four RTRs were investigated for associations between three CASR promoter region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs115759455, rs7652589, rs1501899), three non-synonymous CASR coding region SNPs (A986S, R990G, Q1011E), and aortic and coronary artery calcium mass scores, cardiovascular outcomes and calcification risk factors that included serum phosphate, calcium, total cholesterol and glucose concentrations.; Results: Multivariate analysis revealed that RTRs homozygous for the minor allele (SS) of the A986S SNP, when compared to those homozygous for the major allele (AA), had raised serum glucose concentrations (8.7±5.4 vs. 5.7±2.1 mmol/L, P<0.05). In addition, RTRs who were heterozygous (CT) at the rs115759455 SNP, when compared to those homozygous for the major allele (CC), had higher serum phosphate concentrations (1.1±0.3 vs. 1.0±0.2 mmol/L, P<0.05). CASR SNPs were not significant determinants for aortic or coronary artery calcification, and were not associated with cardiovascular outcomes or mortality in this RTR cohort.; Conclusions: Common CASR SNPs may be independent predictors of serum glucose and phosphate concentrations, but are not determinants of vascular calcification or cardiovascular outcomes.;

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains excessive in patients with chronic kidney disease. The association of vascular changes with regulators of extraosseous calcification in this patient population is still under investigation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations of the calcification inhibitor fetuin-A, and the anti-osteoclastic factor osteoprotegerin (OPG) with vascular pathology in chronic hemodialysis patients.; Methods: In this cross-sectional study including 81 stable chronic hemodialysis patients, we measured carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) with applanation tonometry, reflecting arterial stiffness, and common carotid intima-media thickness (ccIMT), a surrogate of early atherosclerosis, as well as serum levels of fetuin-A and OPG. Co-morbidities, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, inflammatory markers and mineral-bone disease serology parameters were also recorded.; Results: cfPWV correlated inversely with fetuin-A (r=-0.355, p=0.001) and positively with OPG (r=0.584, p<0.001). In multilinear regression analysis including age, gender, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, pulse pressure, LDL, logCRP, both fetuin-A and OPG were independently associated with cfPWV (p=0.024 and p=0.041 respectively). ccIMT was negatively associated with fetuin-A (r=-0.312, p=0.005) and positively with OPG (r=0.521, p<0.0001); however these associations lost statistical significance after adjustment for age.; Conclusion: In chronic hemodialysis patients both fetuin-A and OPG levels are independently associated with arterial stiffness but not with early atherosclerotic vascular changes.;

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD), and particularly kidney failure, is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and approximately a 20-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death. The majority of these patients die from complications directly attributed to atherosclerosis and their life expectancy is decreased. Established risk factors are involved in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. Age, gender, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus are among the established risk factors. Inflammation, qualitative lipid disorders (e.g. small dense low density lipoprotein), vascular calcification and oxidative stress represent emerging risk factors. The precise mechanism of atherosclerosis in patients with kidney failure is not yet known. CKD might represent a clinical model of atherogenesis. Thus, the evidence obtained from investigating "renal" atherogenesis could be of interest in improving our understanding of this disease process in the non-renal population. We review the relationship between "renal" and non-renal atherosclerosis focusing on pathogenesis, risk factors and clinical events and how they interact with treatment options. Overall, the "later" stages of CKD may eventually be considered as a coronary heart disease equivalent condition.;

AB  - Background: Accelerated atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are common in chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in HD patients and atherosclerosis and vascular calcification measured by electron beam computed tomography (EBCT).; Methods: In a cohort of 118 HD patients (52 male, 66 female, mean age: 46+/-13 years), we measured biochemical parameters, including BUN, creatinine, albumin, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels, and performed echocardiography, high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasonography and EBCT in 85 of them. The degree of stenosis was measured at four different sites (communis, bulbus, interna and externa) in both carotid arteries. Carotid plaque scores were calculated by summing the degrees of stenosis measured at all locations.; Results: LVH was detected in 89 of the patients (75%). Plaque-positive patients had higher left ventricular mass index (LVMI) than plaque-negative patients (175+/-59 vs 143+/-46 g/m2, P = 0.003). LVMI was correlated with systolic blood pressure (r = 0.62, P<0.001), pulse pressure (r = 0.58, P<0.001), haemoglobin levels (r = - 0.25, P = 0.008), carotid plaque score (r = 0.32, P = 0.001) and coronary (CACS) and aortic wall calcification score (AWCS) (r = 0.34, P = 0.002 and r = 0.43, P<0.001, respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis (model r = 0.76) showed the independent factors related to LVMI to be systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, CACS and presence of carotid plaques.; Conclusion: Extra-coronary atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are associated with LVH in HD patients. Whether the treatment of atherosclerosis or vascular calcification may cause regression of or even prevent LVH in HD patients remains to be seen.;

AB  - Background: This study aimed to evaluate the degree and incidence of atherosclerosis in internal thoracic (ITA) and radial arteries (RA) harvested for coronary bypass grafting.; Materials and Methods: The association of major clinical events and etiological factors for atherosclerosis was investigated in 770 arterial segments obtained prospectively from 480 patients. Potential risk factors for atherosclerosis were age, gender, smoking, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal failure, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, hypertension, and a positive family history.; Results: Six types of histological lesions have been defined; grade III or more was present in the RA in 47 (16%) patients and in the ITA in 30 (7%). The mean grade was 1.6 +/- 0.6 in the ITA and 2.1 +/- 0.9 in the RA (p < 0.001).; Conclusion: RA had a significantly greater prevalence of atherosclerosis than the same patients' ITA. There was a strong correlation between ITA atherosclerosis and age. The presence of calcification may lead surgeons to avoid an extra incision according to risk factors, although most of these are not predictive.;

AB  - Background/aims: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and fractures are major complications of chronic kidney disease. Hemodialysis patients have a high prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and an increased risk of thromboembolism, which should be prevented with warfarin, a drug potentially causing increased risk of VCs and fractures. Aim of this study is evaluating, in hemodialysis patients with and without AF, the prevalence of VCs and fractures, as well as identifying the associated risk factors.; Methods: A total of 314 hemodialysis patients were recruited, 101 with documented AF and 213 without AF. Comorbidities, chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder blood tests and therapies were collected. Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for the detection of fractures, defined as vertebral body reduction by ≥20 %. In the same radiograph, the length of aortic calcification was also measured. Logistic regression models were applied for evaluating the independent predictors of presence of VCs and vertebral fractures.; Results: In our population VCs were very common (>85 %). Severe VCs (>10 cm) were more common in patients with AF (76 %) than in patients without (33 %). Vertebral fractures were present in 54 % of patients. Multivariable analysis showed that AF (OR 5.41, 95 % CI 2.30-12.73) and 25(OH) vitamin D <20 ng/mL (OR 2.05, 95 % CI 1.10-3.83) were independent predictors of VCs. Age (OR 1.04/year, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07) and male gender (OR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.07-2.90) predicted vertebral fractures.; Conclusions: Hemodialysis patients had an elevated prevalence of severe VCs, especially when affected by AF. Low vitamin D levels were strongly associated with severe VCs. Prevalence of vertebral fractures was also remarkably high and associated with older age and male gender.;

AB  - Background: The 2009 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder clinical practice guideline suggests correcting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D) levels<30ng/mL in patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis, but does not provide a specific treatment protocol.; Study Design: 2-center, double-blind, randomized, 13-week, controlled trial followed by a 26-week open-label study.; Setting& Participants: 55 adult maintenance hemodialysis patients with 25(OH)D levels<30ng/mL were recruited from June 2008 through October 2009.; Intervention: Cholecalciferol, 25,000IU, per week orally versus placebo for 13 weeks, then 26 weeks of individualized cholecalciferol prescription based on NKF-KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines.; Outcomes: Primary end point was the percentage of patients with 25(OH)D levels≥30ng/mL at 13 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of patients with normal calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) blood levels. Safety measures included incidence of hypercalcemia and hypervitaminosis D.; Measurements: Blood calcium and phosphate were measured weekly; iPTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D), and bone turnover markers, trimonthly; fetuin A and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) serum levels and aortic calcification scores were determined at weeks 0 and 39.; Results: The primary end point significantly increased in the treatment group compared with the placebo group (61.5% vs 7.4%; P<0.001), as well as 1,25(OH)2D levels (22.5 [IQR, 15-26] vs 11 [IQR, 10-15]pg/mL; P<0.001) and the proportion of patients achieving the target calcium level (76.9% vs 48.2%; P=0.03). Incidence of hypercalcemia and phosphate and iPTH levels were similar between groups. The second 26-week study phase did not significantly modify the prevalence of 25(OH)D level≥30ng/mL in patients issued from the placebo group.; Limitations: Small size of the study population.; Conclusions: Oral weekly administration of 25,000IU of cholecalciferol for 13 weeks is an effective, safe, inexpensive, and manageable way to increase 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D levels in hemodialysis patients. Further evaluation of clinical end points is suggested.; Copyright © 2014 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Accelerated vascular calcification contributes to cardiovascular disease burden in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized that bisphosphonate therapy would reduce the risk of mortality and cardiovascular events in this population.; Study Design: Retrospective cohort study.; Setting& Participants: Adult women with stage 3 or 4 CKD receiving primary care in a large rural integrated health care system in 2004-2010.; Exposure: Time-dependent exposure status based on outpatient prescription for any medication within the bisphosphonate class, obtained from electronic health records.; Outcomes: Time to death and first cardiovascular event (composite of myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke).; Results: Data from 9,604 eligible female patients with CKD were analyzed; 3,234 were treated with bisphosphonate therapy. During a median follow-up of 3.9 (25th-75th percentile, 2.3-5.4) years, there were 286 versus 881 deaths and 206 versus 571 cardiovascular events (treated vs not-treated groups, respectively). In a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, the adjusted HR for death (treated vs not treated) was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67-0.91; P = 0.003). In Cox modeling adjusted for similar baseline covariates, treatment with bisphosphonates was not associated with a lower risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome (adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.94-1.39; P = 0.2).; Limitations: Residual confounding by unidentified factors, exclusion of male patients, and lack of information about longitudinal drug adherence.; Conclusions: For female patients with CKD, treatment with bisphosphonates is associated with a lower risk of death, but not cardiovascular events. Confirmatory studies and investigations of potential causal mechanisms are warranted.; Copyright © 2012 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether body mass index (BMI) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) are risk factors for kidney function decline in predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.; Design: Prospective cohort study of 125 stage 3 to 5 predialysis CKD patients.; Subjects and Setting: CKD patients receiving care in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.; Methods: BMI, CAC, and kidney function were measured at baseline. CAC was measured by multislice computed tomography scan. Kidney function was determined by the 4-variable reexpressed Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. At study end, kidney function decline among patients was compared according to baseline BMI and CAC.; Main Outcome: Kidney function decline was defined as a 1-year decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 5%.; Results: Individuals with a decline in eGFR of ≥ 5% at 1 year had higher baseline BMI (33.5 ± 8.3 vs. 28.4 ± 4.9 kg/m(2); P = .0001) and higher baseline median CAC scores (239 vs. 25 Agatston units; P = .01) compared with subjects without such a decline. BMI (r = 0.35; P < .0001) and logarithmically transformed CAC score (r = 0.22; P = .01) correlated with an eGFR decline of ≥ 5%. Both crude and adjusted logistic regression analyses showed escalating CAC (with CAC reported in quintiles and CAC score = 0 Agatston unit as the reference group) was associated with an increased risk of eGFR decline of ≥ 5%.; Conclusions: CAC and BMI were associated with kidney function decline over 1 year. The risk of kidney function decline was greater in those with increasing burden of CAC, which remained robust in the adjusted analysis accounting for the risk factors for CKD progression. Larger studies will be required for independent validation of the associations of BMI, CAC, and kidney function decline, and to investigate whether obesity and CAC treatment strategies are efficacious in attenuating kidney function decline in predialysis CKD patients.; Copyright © 2013 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) may lead to low bone mineral density (BMD) and vascular calcification (VC), but links to the latter are unclear. Here we investigated associations between BMD, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, and histological signs of VC in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing living-donor kidney transplantation (LD-Rtx). In 66 ESRD patients (median age 45 years, 68% males), BMD (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA), CAC score (by computed tomography, CT; n = 54), and degree of VC score (graded by histological examination of epigastric artery specimens collected at LD-Rtx; n = 55) were assessed at the time of LD-Rtx. Of the patients, 26% had osteopenia and 7% had osteoporosis. Of those undergoing artery biopsy, 16% had extensive VC, and of those undergoing CT 28% had high CAC score (>100 Agatston units). CAC scores correlated with BMD of legs and pelvis. BMDs of leg and pelvic sub-regions were significantly lower in patients with extensive VC. In multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age and gender, lower BMD of leg sub-region was associated with CAC score >100 AUs and extensive VC, and patients with extensive VC had significantly higher CAC score. Both high CAC and extensive VC were independently predicted by low BMD of legs. Low BMD has the potential to identify ESRD patients at risk of vascular calcification.;

AB  - Purpose: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis. The impact of vascular calcification process on AVF survival remains unclear and results of several studies about this issue are controversial. In the light of the new knowledge about the different susceptibility for calcification process in different blood vessels, the aim of our study was to analyze whether the calcification of AVF-blood vessels may have an impact on AVF longevity.; Methods: The study included 90 patients, 49 males and 41 females, all of them Caucasians, with a mean age 62 ± 11 years, on regular hemodialysis for more than 1 year with patent primary AVFs. Vascular calcification in AVF-blood vessels or in the anastomotic region was detected using X-ray examination.; Results: Calcification in AVF-blood vessels was found in 62% of patients. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that male gender, presence of diabetes mellitus and longer duration of AVF before calcification determination were associated with calcification of AVF-blood vessels. Using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for these standardized predicted values revealed that patients with present AVF-blood vessels calcification had increased risk to develop AVF failure with a hazard rate of 3.42 (95% confidence interval 1.00-11.67; P = 0.049).; Conclusions: Calcifications of AVF-blood vessels are found frequently among dialysis patients and may jeopardize the survival of native AVF. We suggested the local X-ray as simple and valid method for detection of patients that are at risk for AVFs failure which should be monitored more closely.;

AB  - Coronary calcification is a potent predictor of cardiac events. In patients with chronic renal disease, both prevalence and intensity of coronary calcification are increased. It has remained uncertain whether it is the intima of the coronaries or the media that is calcified and whether the morphologic details of calcified plaques differ between renal and nonrenal patients. Autopsy samples of coronaries were obtained from standard sites in 23 renal and 23 age- and gender-matched nonuremic patients. Specimens were examined using light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, backscatter imaging, and x-ray analysis. In coronaries, calcified plaques occupied a similar proportion of the intima area in renal versus nonrenal patients (17.3 +/- 11.9 versus 18.1 +/- 11.9%) but occupied a significantly higher proportion of the media (16.6 +/- 10.6 versus 3.8 +/- 2.31%). Expression of the proteins osteocalcin, C-reactive protein, TGF-beta, and collagen IV was significantly more intensive around coronary plaques of renal compared with nonrenal patients. The non-plaque-bearing intima of renal patients showed minimal staining for fetuin, but fetuin staining was seen surrounding calcified plaques. In addition, more pronounced deposition of C5b-9 was found around coronary plaques of renal patients, and glycophorin deposition pointed to more past intraplaque hemorrhage in renal patients. Calcification by electron backscatter analysis is more intense in the coronary media, but not if the intima is more intense in renal compared with nonrenal patients. A more marked inflammatory response in renal patients is suggested by more frequent presence and greater intensity of markers of inflammation.;

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular calcification represents a marker of cardiovascular risk in chronic dialysis patients. In the general population, aortic arch calcification (AAC) can predict cardiovascular mortality. We conducted a prospective study to investigate factors associated with AAC in hemodialysis patients and examined its prognostic value in long-term outcome.; Methods: A total of 712 hemodialysis patients were enrolled. AAC was identified on postero-anterior chest X-ray films and classified as grade (Gr.) 0, 1, 2 or 3. Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and biochemical data were reviewed and recorded. The patients were followed for 10 years.; Results: AAC was present in 164 patients (23%) as Gr. 1, in 116 patients (16.3%) as Gr. 2 and in 126 patients (17.7%) as Gr. 3. An increase in the severity of calcification was associated with older patients who had lower albumin, higher calcium and glucose levels. During the follow-up period of 10 years, we found that the grade of AAC was directly related to cardiovascular mortality (Gr. 0: 5.3%; Gr. 1: 12.7%; Gr. 2: 18.9%, and Gr. 3: 24.4%; p < 0.05) and all-cause mortality (Gr. 0: 19.9%; Gr. 1: 31.1%; Gr. 2: 44.8%, and Gr. 3: 53.2%; p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients with AAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis. The severity of AAC also influenced their survival.; Conclusion: Calcification of the aortic arch detected in plain chest radiography was an important determinant of cardiovascular as well as all-cause mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients. The presence and severity of AAC predicted long-term survival.;

AB  - Purpose: In patients on dialysis, the most common cause of death is cardiovascular disease. This is caused, at least in part, by excessive vascular calcification. Studies that have examined coronary calcification have been published, but these measurements require expensive equipment. Here, we used computed tomography to determine aortic calcification and evaluated these data as prognostic markers for cardiovascular disease.; Methods: Computed tomography with contrast medium was performed on 49 patients undergoing hemodialysis (29 males and 20 females; average age, 68.9 ± 11.0 years). A calcification score (CS) was defined as the ratio of the volume of vascular calcification to the volume of the thoracic aorta. All patients were monitored for cardiovascular end points, which included cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic, or echocardiographic abnormalities that suggested myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery, leg amputation, and hospitalization or death due to heart failure.; Results: Patients were followed for 3 years, with 12 patients reaching the end point. Both high CS (p = 0.007) and male gender (p = 0.009) were significantly associated with cardiovascular events. In contrast, events were not related to age, dialysis duration, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, pulse-wave velocity, maximum intima-media thickness of the carotid artery wall, systolic blood pressure, or left ventricular hypertrophy. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a high baseline CS was a significant predictor for cardiovascular events (p < 0.05).; Conclusions: Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional computed tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients on hemodialysis.;

AB  - Based on native CT scans of the pelvic region using a standardized calcification score, evaluation of iliac vascular calcification was performed between 2008 and 2012 prior to listing for renal transplantation in 205 patients with chronic kidney disease. Vascular calcification showed a decrease from proximal to distal. The difference between the degree of calcification in the common iliac artery and in the external iliac artery was significant (P<.001). Risk factors for total iliac vascular calcification were age, smoking, sex, underlying renal disease, and diabetes. Multivariate analysis revealed age to be the most relevant risk factor (P<.001). The duration of hemodialysis correlated significantly with total iliac vascular calcification. As the introduction of the standardized surgical evaluation protocol, no transplantation has had to be broken off and no early graft loss due to calcification has occurred. Thus, careful scoring of vascular calcification prior to transplantation may be a valuable tool to support surgical decisions and to improve patient safety and outcome in increasingly older transplant recipients.; © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Matrix Gla protein (MGP) and bone Gla protein (BGP) are two vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs) involved in the regulation of vascular calcification (VC). We carried out a secondary analysis of the VIKI study to evaluate associations between drug consumption and VKDP levels in 387 hemodialyzed patients. The VIKI study assessed the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency in hemodialysis patients. We evaluated drug consumption, determined BGP and MGP levels, and verified the presence of any vertebral fractures (VF) and VC by spine radiographs. Total BGP levels were twice as high with calcimimetics versus no calcimimetics (290 vs. 158.5 mcg/L, p < 0.0001) and 69 % higher with vitamin D analogs (268 vs. 159 mcg/L, p < 0.0001). Total MGP was 19 % higher with calcimimetics (21.5 vs. 18.1 mcg/L, p = 0.04) and 54 % higher with calcium acetate (27.9 vs. 18.1 mcg/L, p = 0.003); no difference was found with vitamin D analogs (21.1 vs. 18.3 mcg/L, p = 0.43). Median Total BGP level was 29 % lower in patients with ≥1 VF (151 vs. 213 mcg/L, p = 0.0091) and 36 % lower in patients with VC (164 vs. 262.1 mcg/L, p = 0.0003). In non-survivors, median BGP and MGP were lower, but only for MGP this difference reached the statistical significance (152 vs. 191 mcg/L, p = 0.20 and 15.0 vs. 19.7 mcg/L, p = 0.02, respectively). Pending studies on vitamin K supplementation, calcimimetics, and vitamin D analogs may play a role in preserving vitamin K-dependent protein activity, thus contributing to bone and vascular health in CKD patients.;

AB  - Background: In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), disorders of mineral metabolism are associated with vascular calcifications and mortality. Microvascular dysfunction, by affecting flow resistance and tissue perfusion, may explain the cardiovascular sequelae of CKD-associated disorders of mineral metabolism. We investigated whether advanced CKD is associated with a decrease in the functional and structural number of capillaries in skin and subsequently whether capillary rarefaction is related to mineral metabolism.; Methods: Capillary density was measured by nailfold microscopy in 19 predialysis and 35 CKD Stage 5 (CKD5) patients and 19 controls. In CKD patients, calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitaminD3 (25vitD3) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (1,25vitD3) were analysed as well.; Results: Capillary density at baseline was 42 ± 15/mm(2) in predialysis patients, 45 ± 17/mm(2) in CKD5 patients and 56 ± 20/mm(2) in controls (patients versus controls, respectively, P < 0.05 and P = 0.05). Absolute capillary recruitment during post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia was 17 ± 7/mm(2), 14 ± 6/mm(2) and 23 ± 8/mm(2), respectively (P < 0.05 for both patients and controls). Capillary density during venous occlusion was 59 ± 20/mm(2), 59 ± 21/mm(2) and 77 ± 21/mm(2), respectively (P < 0.05 for both patients and controls). In multiple regression analysis, both serum phosphorus and bicarbonate values were independently and inversely associated with capillary density at baseline (r(2) of model = 19%) as well as during venous occlusion (r(2) of model = 28%). Furthermore, both serum phosphorus and bicarbonate were inversely and female gender positively correlated with capillary density during recruitment (r(2) of model = 37%).; Conclusion: Advanced CKD is characterized by an impaired functional and structural capillary density in skin, which is related to both high phosphorus and bicarbonate values.;

AB  - Background: In recipients with type 1 diabetes, we aimed to determine whether long-term normoglycemia achieved by successful simultaneous pancreas and kidney (SPK) transplantation could beneficially affect progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) when compared with transplantation of a kidney-alone from a living donor (LDK).; Methods: In 42 kidney transplant recipients with functioning grafts who had received either SPK (n = 25) or LDK (n = 17), we studied angiographic progression of CAD between baseline (pretransplant) and follow-up at 7 years or older. In addition, computed tomography scans for measures of coronary artery calcification and echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular systolic function were addressed at follow-up.; Results: During a median follow-up time of 10.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 9.1-11.5) progression of CAD occurred at similar rates (10 of 21 cases in the SPK and 5 of 14 cases in the LDK group; P = 0.49). Median coronary artery calcification scores were high in both groups (1767 [IQR, 321-4035] for SPK and 1045 [IQR, 807-2643] for LDK patients; P = 0.59). Left ventricular systolic function did not differ between the 2 groups. The SPK and LDK recipients were similar in age (41.2 ± 6.9 years vs 40.5 ± 10.3 years; P = 0.80) and diabetes duration at engraftment but with significant different mean HbA1c levels of 5.5 ± 0.4% for SPK and 8.3 ± 1.5% for LDK patients (P < 0.001) during follow-up.; Conclusions: In patients with both type 1 diabetes and end-stage renal disease, SPK recipients had similar progression of CAD long-term compared with LDK recipients. Calcification of coronary arteries is a prominent feature in both groups long-term posttransplant.;

AB  - Objectives: We sought to determine clinical and laboratory correlates of calcification of the coronary arteries (CAs), aorta and mitral and aortic valves in adult subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis.; Background: Vascular calcification is known to be a risk factor for ischemic heart disease in non-uremic individuals. Patients with ESRD experience accelerated vascular calcification, due at least in part to dysregulation of mineral metabolism. Clinical correlates of the extent of calcification in ESRD have not been identified. Moreover, the clinical relevance of calcification as measured by electron-beam tomography (EBT) has not been determined in the ESRD population.; Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 205 maintenance hemodialysis patients who received baseline EBT for evaluation of vascular and valvular calcification. We compared subjects with and without clinical evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and determined correlates of the extent of vascular and valvular calcification using multivariable linear regression and proportional odds logistic regression analyses.; Results: The median coronary artery calcium score was 595 (interquartile range, 76 to 1,600), values consistent with a high risk of obstructive coronary artery disease in the general population. The CA calcium scores were directly related to the prevalence of myocardial infarction (p < 0.0001) and angina (p < 0.0001), and the aortic calcium scores were directly related to the prevalence of claudication (p = 0.001) and aortic aneurysm (p = 0.02). The extent of coronary calcification was more pronounced with older age, male gender, white race, diabetes, longer dialysis vintage and higher serum concentrations of calcium and phosphorus. Total cholesterol (and high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein subfractions), triglycerides, hemoglobin and albumin were not significantly related to the extent of CA calcification. Only dialysis vintage was significantly associated with the prevalence of valvular calcification.; Conclusions: Coronary artery calcification is common, severe and significantly associated with ischemic cardiovascular disease in adult ESRD patients. The dysregulation of mineral metabolism in ESRD may influence vascular calcification risk.;

AB  - Background: Children receiving maintenance dialysis exhibit high cardiovascular (CV) associated mortality. We and others have shown high prevalence of cardiac calcifications (CC) in children with endstage renal disease (ESRD). However, no pediatric study has examined modality difference in CC prevalence. The current study was conducted to assess for a difference in CC prevalence between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) in children with ESRD.; Methods: 38 patients (19 female, 19 male; mean age 15.5 ± 4.1 years) receiving dialysis (21 HD, 17 PD) were included in the study. CC were assessed by ultrafast gated CT and quantified by Agatston score. Patients received thrice weekly HD for 3 - 3.5 hours or daily continuous cycler PD (CCPD). FGF 23, IL-6, IL-8, and CRP levels were obtained at time of CT. Time-averaged (6 months prior to CT) serum Ca, P, Alb, iPTH, and cholesterol levels were obtained. Patients on aspirin, with evidence of infection, underlying collagen vascular disease were excluded.; Results: CC were present in 11/38 patients, but more prevalent in HD vs. PD (9/21 vs. 2/17, p = 0.04). Subjects with CC were older (p = 0.0003), had longer dialysis vintage (p = 0.02) and higher serum phosphorus (p = 0.02) and FGF 23 levels (p = 0.03). HD patients also had significantly higher phosphorus (p = 0.02), FGF 23 (p = 0.009), and IL-8 levels (p = 0.02) when compared to PD patients. Residual renal function was not different between modalities or patients with CC. On a multinomial regression model, modality, and age remained independent associations for CC prevalence.; Conclusion: We have shown that pediatric patients receiving CCPD have lower CC prevalence conferring lower CV risk. The better control of mineral imbalance in patients receiving PD may play an important role in lower CC prevalence.;

AB  - Aim: Cardiac disease is a major cause of mortality in uremic patients. The aim of this paper was to evaluate cardiac calcium content in uremic patients with multislice computed tomography (MSCT).; Methods: The study has been carried out on 120 uremic and 28 nonuremic patients affected by cardiovascular disease. Serum calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphate product, intact PTH were assayed. Several lipidic and nutritional parameters were measured. Calcification values obtained with the MSCT were reported in terms of Agatson scores.; Results: We found that the average score values in cohort on uremic was 10 times higher than in nonuremic patients (score values 3.389 vs 328). Cardiac calcification score was found to be correlated significantly to age (P=0.006), HD age (P=0.010), serum calcium (P=0.006), iPTH (P=0.004). Multiregression analysis (MRA) with the cardiac score as dependent variable selected the following variables (R(2) 0.612): age (P=0.002), HD age (P=0.010), serum cholesterol (P<0.000), triglycerides (P=0.001) and inversely HDL cholesterol (P=0.001) and non-HDL cholesterol (P=0.001) as predictive variables for cardiac score. By comparing patients with scores lower and higher than 400, the group with score <400 showed a significantly lower age (P=0.0001), HD vintage (P=0.01) and a significantly higher serum cholesterol (P=0.009), HDL cholesterol (P=0.05) and non-HDL cholesterol (P=0.05).; Conclusions: The MSCT could help in identifying and stratifying high-risk patients to implement preventive strategies. The control of mineral metabolism and of lipid levels is important in prevention of arterial calcification in uremic patients.;

AB  - Background: Calcium deposits in the aortic valve and mitral annulus have been associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. However, there is no accepted standard method for scoring such cardiac calcifications, and most existing methods are simplistic. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a semiquantitative score, one that accounts for all visible calcium on echocardiography, could predict all-cause mortality and stroke in a graded fashion.; Methods: This was a retrospective study of 443 unselected subjects derived from a general echocardiography database. A global cardiac calcium score (GCCS) was applied that assigned points for calcification in the aortic root and valve, mitral annulus and valve, and submitral apparatus, and points for restricted leaflet mobility. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was stroke.; Results: Over a mean 3.8 ± 1.7 years of follow-up, there were 116 deaths and 34 strokes. Crude mortality increased in a graded fashion with increasing GCCS. In unadjusted proportional hazard analysis, the GCCS was significantly associated with total mortality (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.17-1.35; P < .0001) and stroke (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07-1.40; P = .003). After adjusting for demographic and clinical factors (age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, family history of coronary disease, chronic kidney disease, history of atrial fibrillation, and history of stroke), these associations remained significant.; Conclusions: The GCCS is easily applied to routinely acquired echocardiograms and has clinically significant associations with total mortality and stroke.; Copyright Â© 2016 American Society of Echocardiography.

AB  - Calcification complications are frequent among long-term dialysis patients. However, the prognostic implication of cardiac valve calcification in this population is not known. This study aimed to determine if cardiac valve calcification predicts mortality in long-term dialysis patients. Baseline echocardiography was performed in 192 patients (mean +/- SD age, 55 +/- 12 yr) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (mean +/- SD duration of dialysis, 39 +/- 31 mo) to screen for calcification of the aortic valve, mitral valve, or both. Valvular calcification was present in 62 patients. During the mean follow-up of 17.9 mo (range, 0.6 to 33.9 mo), 46 deaths (50% of cardiovascular causes) were observed. Overall 1-yr survival was 70% and 93% for patients with and without valvular calcification (P < 0.0001, log-rank test). Cardiovascular mortality was 22% and 3% for patients with and without valvular calcification (P < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that cardiac valve calcification was predictive of an increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.50; 95% CI, 1.32 to 4.76; P = 0.005) and cardiovascular death (HR 5.39; 95% CI, 2.16 to 13.48; P = 0.0003) independent of age, male gender, dialysis duration, C-reactive protein, diabetes, and atherosclerotic vascular disease. Eighty-nine percent of patients with both valvular calcification and atherosclerotic vascular disease, 23% of patients with valvular calcification only, 21% of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease only, and 13% of patients with neither complication died at 1-yr (P < 0.0005). The cardiovascular death rate was 85% for patients with both complications, 13% for patients with valvular calcification only, 14% for patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease only, and 5% for those with neither complication (P < 0.0005). The number of calcified valves was associated with all-cause mortality (P < 0.0005) and cardiovascular death (P < 0.0005). One-year all-cause mortality was 57% for patients with both aortic and mitral valves calcified, 40% for those with either valve calcified, and 15% for those with neither valve calcified. In conclusion, cardiac valve calcification is a powerful predictor for mortality and cardiovascular deaths in long-term dialysis patients. Valvular calcification by itself has similar prognostic importance as the presence of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Its coexistence with other atherosclerotic complications indicates more severe disease and has the worst outcome.;

AB  - Background: Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has been detected with increased frequency in haemodialysis (HD) patients, making it necessary to determine the potential pathogenic factors in uraemic patients.; Methods: A total of 92 chronic HD patients (39 female, 53 male) and 92 age and gender-matched nondialysis control subjects were evaluated by echocardiography and a severity score for VC was determined. Calcium phosphate metabolism was evaluated at the beginning of haemodialysis.; Results: We found a greater prevalence of VC in dialysis patients than in normal patients (mitral annulus 44.5% vs 10%, P = 0.02; aortic annulus 52% vs 4.3%, P = 0.01). HD patients with mitral calcification were found to be older than patients without calcification, were on long-term renal replacement therapy, had longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension, had greater values of the highest value of mean calcium phosphate product in 6 successive months (CaxP) and the highest absolute value of calcium-phosphate product (CaxPmax). We also found a positive correlation between calcification score, age, and CaxP. No correlation was found between actual VC and arterial hypertension or parathyroid hormone. Multiple stepwise regression analysis selected age and CaxP as the most predictive parameters for mitral calcification (r = 0.47). Mitral calcification was associated more frequently with rhythm and cardiac conduction defects, valvular insufficiency and with peripheral vascular calcification. Aortic calcification was correlated with age (r = 0.42) and longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension.; Conclusion: Our study confirmed an increased prevalence of VC in HD patients and selected age and calcium phosphate product as the most predictive parameters. These findings support careful monitoring of calcium metabolism beginning at the early stages of end-stage renal failure to reduce the risk of heart disease.;

AB  - Background: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk for tissue calcifications as a result of deranged mineral metabolism. We tested the hypothesis that valvular calcification is a marker of atherosclerosis in patients with ESRD.; Methods: Echocardiography was performed in 92 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis with no background atherosclerotic vascular complications to detect valvular calcification. We used B-mode ultrasonography to determine carotid artery intima-media thickness and the presence of plaque and calcification.; Results: Compared with patients without valvular calcification (n=66), those with valvular calcification (n=26) had higher C-reactive protein levels (P=.01) and greater mean +/- SE carotid intima-media thickness (1.12 +/- 0.06 vs 0.88 +/- 0.04 mm; P=.003). Carotid artery calcification was present unilaterally and bilaterally in 4 patients (15%) and 17 patients (65%) with valvular calcification vs 11 (17%) and 14 (21%) without, respectively (P<.001). Carotid artery plaque was present unilaterally and bilaterally in 11 patients (12%) and 16 patients (65%) with valvular calcification vs 3 (17%) and 17 (24%) without, respectively (P=.001). Using multiple logistic regression analysis, every 1-mm increase in carotid intima-media thickness was independently associated with a 6.51-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.58-26.73; P=.009) increased risk of valvular calcification, and calcification and plaque in the carotid arteries were associated with a 7.18-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.39-21.51; P<.001) and a 5.00-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.77-14.13; P=.002) increased risk of valvular calcification, respectively.; Conclusion: The associations among valvular calcification, inflammation, carotid atherosclerosis, and arterial calcification suggest that valvular calcification is a marker of atherosclerosis and arterial calcification in patients with ESRD.;

AB  - We will present our experience and our preliminary data about the correlation between cardiac calcification and QT interval (and QT dispersion) in uraemia. We studied 32 haemodialysis (HD) patients (age 69 +/- 16 years, time on dialysis 32 +/- 27 months) and 12 chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD-4) patients (age 66 +/- 17 years, uraemia duration 38 +/- 16 months). The patients were characterized by a good mineral control, as shown by serum phosphate levels (3.6 +/- 1.3 mg/dl in CKD-4 and 4.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl in HD patients) and Ca x P product (46 +/- 17 and 49 +/- 16 mg(2)/dl(2), respectively). The parathyroid hormone levels were higher in HD than CKD-4 patients (p < 0.0001). A TC score >400 was found to be highly prevalent in both groups. Significantly more HD patients (62.5%) showed cardiac calcification than CKD-4 patients (33%; p = 0.01). The patients were matched for TC scores higher or lower than 400. The two groups differed by gender (p < 0.05), age (p = 0.026), frequency of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), uraemia follow-up period (p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (p = 0.009), Ca x P product (p = 0.002), parathyroid hormone level (p < 0.0001), and corrected QT dispersion (p < 0.0001). The QT interval was higher in HD and CKD-4 patients with higher TC scores (approximately 11%), but QT interval dispersion was significantly higher in patients with TC scores >400. QT dispersion showed a linear correlation with TC scores in both groups (r = 0.899 and p < 0.0001 and r = 0.901 and p < 0.0001). Male gender, age, time (months) of uraemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin, calcium x phosphorus product, parathyroid hormone, and TC score are important determinants of QT dispersion. Our data show that it is possible to link dysrhythmias and cardiac calcification in uraemic patients.;

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular calcification (CVC) is common and severe in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. However, the prevalence and severity of CVC is less well documented in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet on dialysis.; Methods: Fifty-eight nondialyzed HA with type 2 diabetes and CKD were enrolled. They comprise 29 patients with stages 1 and 2 CKD (early CKD group) and 26 patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD (advanced CKD group). Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was measured by ultrafast spiral computed tomography, while peripheral artery calcification (PAC) was evaluated by plain x-ray of the chest, pelvis, thighs, and lower extremities.; Results: The prevalence of CAC and PAC were significantly higher in the advanced CKD group compared to the early CKD group (73% vs. 38%; P < 0.01 and 85% vs. 35%; P < 0.0001, respectively). The median CAC scores were 18-fold greater in the advanced CKD group (138.9 vs. 7.8, respectively). By linear regression analysis, a strong association was found between the level of renal function and ln total volume of CAC.; Conclusion: Our data indicate that CAC and PAC are common and severe in HA diabetic patients with CKD not previously treated with dialysis, calcium-based phosphate binders, or vitamin D analogues. Lower level of renal function is associated with increased burden of vascular calcification in predialysis patients with CKD.;

AB  - Objective: To determine the ability of Coronary Artery Calcification Score (CACS) and carotid ultrasonography in detecting subclinical atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).; Methods: A set of 104 consecutive RA patients without history of cardiovascular (CV) events were studied to determine CACS, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and plaques. Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) modified according to the EULAR recommendations (mSCORE) was also assessed.; Results: The mean disease duration was 10.8 years, 72.1% had rheumatoid factor and/or anti-CCP positivity and 16.4% extra-articular manifestations. Nine were excluded because they had type 2 diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. CV risk was categorised in the remaining 95 RA patients according to the mSCORE as follows: low (n=21), moderate (n=60) and high/very high risk (n=14). Most patients with low mSCORE (16/21; 76.2%) had normal CACS (zero), and none of them CACS>100. However, a high number of patients with carotid plaques was disclosed in the groups with CACS 0 (23/40; 57.5%) or CACS 1-100 (29/38; 76.3%). 72 (75.8%) of the 95 patients fulfilled definitions for high/very high CV as they had an mSCORE ≥5% or mSCORE <5% plus one of the following findings: severe carotid ultrasonography findings (cIMT>0.9 mm and/or plaques) or CACS>100. A CACS>100 showed sensitivity similar to mSCORE (23.6% vs 19.4%). In contrast, the presence of severe carotid ultrasonography findings allowed identifying most patients who met definitions for high/very high CV risk (70/72; sensitivity 97.2% (95% CI 90.3 to 99.7)).; Conclusions: Carotid ultrasonography is more sensitive than CACS for the detection of subclinical atherosclerosis in RA.;

AB  - Aims: Vascular calcification and atherosclerosis frequently develop in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although several reports have investigated both carotid artery calcification (CAAC) and carotid atherosclerosis in ESRD patients, the relationship between the two vascular conditions has remained unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of CAAC and carotid artery plaque (CAP) in patients with ESRD and to investigate potential factors contributing to the development of CAAC and CAP.; Material and Method: This cross-sectional study assessed CAAC and CAP using multidetector computed tomography and high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, respectively, in 135 patients with ESRD at the start of hemodialysis. The prevalence of CAAC and CAP was examined. The risk factors associated with CAAC and CAP were also evaluated using a logistic regression model.; Results: CAAC and CAP were found in 71% and 65%, of the patients, respectively. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and gender showed that CAAC was significantly associated with age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, serum albumin, calcium-phosphorus product, proteinuria and CAP. In contrast, in the same analysis, CAP was significantly correlated with age, male gender, diabetes, intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria and CAAC. In the multivariate analysis, CAAC was independently associated with age, hypertension, and calcium-phosphorus product. Male gender was identified as an independent determinant for CAP. Furthermore, CAP remained as an independent risk factor of CAAC (odds ratio (OR): 13.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.08-47.29), and CAAC also showed a high OR for having CAP (OR: 11.74; 95% CI: 4.12-33.51).; Conclusion: Both CAAC and CAP were associated with traditional and/or non-traditional risk factors. The risk factors of CAAC were different from those of CAP. CAAC or CAP was identified to be an independent risk factor for each other with a high OR, thus suggesting a strong relationship between carotid calcification and atherosclerosis.;

AB  - Background: To determine the underlying conditions that affect the degree of calcification of carotid arterial plaques, measured quantitatively using multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT), and to study the association of carotid calcification with clinical symptomatology.; Methods: We measured the calcification volume of stenotic lesions at the carotid bifurcation using MDCT in 84 consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo carotid revascularization. These results were compared with the clinical and radiological characteristics of the patients.; Results: On MDCT, calcification in the carotid plaques was present in 78 patients (93%). Compared to the other patients, patients in the highest quartile of calcification volume (quartile 4) had higher serum creatinine levels (p < 0.001) and tended to have fewer symptomatic ischemic events in the territory of the affected carotid artery in the preceding 6 months (29 vs. 49%, p = 0.099); in particular, there were fewer transient symptoms (5 vs. 27%, p = 0.032) and symptoms possibly occurring due to local embolism (14 vs. 37%, p = 0.045). On ultrasound, plaque ulceration was less prevalent in patients in quartile 4 than in the remaining patients (5 vs. 29%, p = 0.026), although the severity of carotid stenosis was similar among all the quartiles.; Conclusions: Renal dysfunction was associated with enhanced carotid plaque calcification. Patients with severe carotid calcification were found to have a low risk of recent ischemic stroke, presumably due, in part, to a lower prevalence of emboligenic carotid ulceration. MDCT was valuable for the quantitative evaluation of carotid calcification.;

AB  - Studies on carotid artery atherosclerosis have been performed in order to understand the high risk for cardiovascular disease in chronic renal failure (CRF). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent and nature of carotid artery atherosclerosis in patients with CRF. Of the 135 patients with CRF (52 +/- 11 years), 58 had moderate to severe predialysis CRF (PR), 36 were on dialysis treatment (DI), and 41 were renal transplant recipients (TR). In addition, 58 control subjects (CO) were examined. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), plaque prevalence, plaque score, and stiffness index beta were determined. Furthermore, plaque calcification and internal carotid artery stenoses were classified. Plaque prevalence (PR 64%, DI 61%, TR 51%, CO 28%; P < 0.001) and plaque score (PR 3.3 +/- 4.3, DI 3.0 +/- 3.4, TR 2.5 +/- 3.2, CO 0.8 +/- 1.7 mm; P < 0.001) were significantly greater in the CRF patient groups compared to the controls, whereas no difference in IMT was noted between the study groups. The prevalences of plaque calcification and internal carotid artery stenoses were higher among the CRF patient groups. In addition, the stiffness index beta was higher in the CRF patient groups. The present study shows that the characteristic alterations of the carotid arteries in CRF include increased plaque burden, calcification and increased arterial stiffness.; Copyright 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: Calcified plaques are suggested to represent atherosclerotic lesions with stabilising properties. However, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) frequently have calcified plaques but significant higher prevalence of cardiovascular complications. The aim of our study was therefore to analyse the effect of CKD in patients with advanced carotid stenosis (>70%) on plaque composition, lesion stability and risk of rupture.; Methods: We investigated retrospectively, by histology, carotid plaques of patients with high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Comparison of plaque morphology was performed on 41 patients with CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml min(-1) (according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, MDRD-eGFR) and 56 patients with normal renal function.; Results: Patients with CKD had significantly higher percentage of total calcification (17% vs. 7%, p<0.001), unstable and ruptured plaques (83% vs. 52%, p=0.001 and 59% vs. 36%, p=0.039, respectively) compared with patients with normal renal function. By contrast, the content of collagenous fibres was significantly reduced in CKD patients (40% vs. 57%, p=0.011). No significant differences were found for neurological symptoms and soft plaque content.; Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that CKD significantly affects plaque composition in patients with advanced carotid artery stenosis. Enhanced calcification and reduced collagenous plaque may lead to plaque instability and rupture.; Copyright 2009 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Abnormalities of bone metabolism and increased vascular calcification are common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and important causes of morbidity and mortality. The Wnt signaling pathway may play a role in the bone and vascular disturbances seen in CKD, termed collectively "CKD-MBD." The aim of the study was to investigate the possible association of circulating concentrations of the secreted Wnt signaling inhibitors DKK1 and sclerostin with BMD and arterial stiffness in predialysis CKD. Seventy-seven patients (48 M, 29 F), mean age 57 (SD = 14) years with CKD stages 3B (n = 32) and 4 (n = 45) were studied. Sclerostin, DKK1, PTH, and 1,25(OH)(2)D were analyzed. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH), and forearm (FARM). Arterial stiffness index was determined by contour analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a positive correlation between sclerostin and age (r = 0.47, p < 0.000). Sclerostin was higher in men than women (p = 0.013). Following correction for age and gender, there was a negative association between GFR and sclerostin (p = 0.002). We observed a positive association between sclerostin and BMD at the LS (p = 0.0001), FN (p = 0.004), and TH (p = 0.002). In contrast, DKK1 was negatively associated with BMD at the FN (p = 0.038). A negative association was seen between DKK1 and SI(DVP) (p = 0.027). Our data suggest that the Wnt pathway may play a role in CKD-MBD. Prospective studies are required to establish the clinical relevance of sclerostin and DKK1 as serological markers in CKD.;

AB  - Background: Sclerostin is a potent inhibitor of bone formation, but the meaning of its serum levels remains undetermined. We evaluated the association between sclerostin levels and clinical or biological data in hemodialyzed patients (HD), notably parathormone (PTH), biomarkers of bone turnover, vascular calcifications and mortality after 2 years.; Methods: 164 HD patients were included in this observational study. The calcification score was assessed with the Kauppila method. Patients were followed for 2 years.; Results: Median sclerostin levels were significantly (p < 0.0001) higher in HD versus healthy subjects (n = 94) (1,375 vs. 565 pg/ml, respectively). In univariate analysis a significant association (p < 0.05) was found between sclerostin and age, height, dialysis vintage, albumin, troponin, homocysteine, PTH, C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteoprotegerin, but not with the calcification score. In a multivariate model, the association remained with age, height, dialysis vintage, troponin, homocysteine, phosphate, PTH, but also with vascular calcifications. Association was positive for all variables, except PTH and vascular calcifications. The baseline sclerostin concentration was not different in survivors and non-survivors.; Conclusions: We confirm a higher concentration of sclerostin in HD patients, a positive association with age and a negative association with PTH. A positive association with phosphate, homocysteine and troponin calls for additional research. The clinical interest of sclerostin to assess vascular calcifications in HD is limited and no association was found between sclerostin and mortality.; © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background and Aims: Retinopathy and vascular calcification (VC) are representative markers of microvascular and macrovascular dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, their relationship and combined effects on clinical outcomes remain undetermined.; Methods and Results: We included 523 patients with nondialysis-dependent CKD stage 3-5 who had been examined with fundus photography for diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy. Simple radiographs were analyzed for the presence of VC. The clinical significance of VC of the abdominal aorta and iliofemoral artery (apVC) and retinopathy was evaluated in terms of the rate of renal function decline and composite of any cardiovascular event or death. CKD patients with retinopathy showed higher prevalence of apVC than those without retinopathy (25.6% vs. 12.5%, P < 0.001).The presence of retinopathy was independently associated with apVC (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.31, 3.49). In multivariate analysis, compared with subjects with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the coexistence of both apVC and retinopathy were independently associated with rapid renal function decline (β = -1.51; 95% CI -2.40, -0.61), whereas apVC or retinopathy alone were not. Compared with subjects with neither apVC nor retinopathy, the HRs for composite end points were 1.05 (95% CI 0.48, 2.27), 1.79 (95% CI 1.14, 2.80), and 2.07 (95% CI 1.17, 3.67) for patients with apVC only, those with retinopathy only, and those with both apVC and retinopathy, respectively.; Conclusion: The coexistence of VC and retinopathy was independently associated with CKD progression and cardiovascular events or deaths, and its combined effect was stronger than any separate condition.; Copyright © 2016 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

AB  - Background: Vascular calcifications (VC) are a well-known cardiovascular risk factor (CVRF) in uremic patients. However, their role on mortality after renal transplantation (RT) is unclear.; Methods: In 1117 RT recipients, we investigated the association between long-term survival and the presence of VC, evaluated by preoperative posteroanterior plain radiography from aorto-iliac region, at the time of RT. The primary study outcome was all-cause mortality. Other perioperative CVRF were also collected.; Results: VC were observed in 273 patients (24.4%) before RT; additionally, 132 (12%) patients died during follow-up, due, mainly, to cardiovascular (39%) or infectious (24%) complications. As expected, patients with VC showed a higher age and a greater number of CVRF than those without VC. Overall mortality rate was also higher in VC group (19 vs. 9.5%; P= 0.0001), as well as cardiovascular mortality (9.5 vs. 3.1; P= 0.048). Multivariate Cox model showed that VC were predictor of overall mortality [relative risk (RR) 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-2.8; P= 0.015] and cardiovascular mortality (RR 2.6; 95%CI 1.1-6); P= 0.033), independently of other CVRF. An interaction between the presence of VC and diabetes was found. The effect of VC on mortality was evident in nondiabetic patients, that is, those with VC had a significantly higher mortality rate than patients without VC (21 vs. 9%; P= 0.0001). By contrast, these differences were not observed in diabetic patients (16.5 vs. 14.3%; P= 0.656).; Conclusion: VC evaluated by a simple and inexpensive plain radiography are an independent predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality following RT. This finding may encourage the implementation of appropriate therapeutic strategies after RT.;

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of atherectomy devices in obese patients with coronary artery calcification (CAC).; Background: Atherectomy is an important tool for lesion preparation in patients with CAC undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There have been no studies that compared the outcomes of orbital atherectomy (OA) and rotational atherectomy (RA) in obese patients.; Methods: A total of 35,590 patients from five tertiary-care hospitals who underwent PCI between January 2011 to April 2016 were identified. All adult patients with body mass index ≥30 kg/ m2 who had OA or RA prior to PCI were included in this analysis. A total of 91 patients were included in the OA arm and 131 patients in the RA arm prior to the matching. To remove potential selection bias, a propensity-score matched analysis was performed, and 69 patients were included in each group.; Results: The primary endpoint, composite of safety outcomes, did not occur in any patient of either group. The secondary endpoints - death on discharge (0.0% vs 1.5%; P=.48) and myocardial infarction (2.9% vs 6.4%; P=.42) - were similar between groups, as were individual outcomes including cardiogenic shock, bleeding complications, and congestive heart failure. Stroke, vascular complications, and the requirement for dialysis initiation did not occur in any of the patients.; Conclusion: In this study assessing atherectomy in obese patients, OA and RA demonstrated comparable outcomes with complication rates within an acceptable range. It demonstrates that OA and RA can be safely performed in this high-risk patient subset with CAC.;

AB  - Background: The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical relevance of aortic calcification in urolithiasis patients.; Methods: Between January 2010 and September 2014, 1221 patients with urolithiasis were treated in Oyokyo Kidney Research Institute and Hirosaki University Hospital. Among these, 287 patients (Stone group) on whom adequate data were available were included in this retrospective study. We also selected 148 subjects with early stage (pT1N0M0) renal cell carcinoma from 607 renal cell carcinoma patients who underwent radical nephrectomy at Hirosaki University Hospital (Non-stone group) as control subjects. Validity of the Non-stone group was evaluated by comparison with pair-matched 296 volunteers from 1166 subjects who participated in the Iwaki Health Promotion Project in 2014. Thereafter, age, body mass index, aortic calcification index (ACI), renal function, serum uric acid concentrations, and comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease) were compared between the Non-stone and Stone groups. Independent factors for higher ACI and impaired renal function were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis.; Results: We confirmed relevance of Non-stone group patients as a control subject by comparing the pair-matched community-dwelling volunteers. Backgrounds of patients between the Non-stone and Stone groups were not significantly different except for the presence of hypertension in the Stone group. ACI was not significantly high in the Stone group compared with the Non-stone group. However, age-adjusted ACI was greater in the Stone group than the Non-stone group. Among urolithiasis patients, ACI was significantly higher in uric acid containing stone patients. The number of patients with stage 3B chronic kidney disease (CKD) was significantly higher in the Stone group than in the Non-stone group (12% vs. 4%, P = 0.008). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed higher aortic calcification index (>13%), and being a stone former were independent factors for stage 3B CKD at the time of diagnosis.; Conclusion: Aortic calcification and being a stone former had harmful influence on renal function. This study was registered as a clinical trial: UMIN: UMIN000022962.;

AB  - Objective: Subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are exposed to increased morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular events. The primary underlying mechanism has been suggested as accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients. Our aim was to compare the atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification in subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis to that in normal controls utilizing fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT).; Subjects and Methods: Forthy two subjects who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging were retrospectively studied. Twenty one were subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis (67±11 years old; 14 male, 7 female) and 21 were age- and gender-matched controls. Average standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) and SUVmean for 4 segments of the aorta (ascending, arch, descending, abdominal) and for the common iliac arteries and common femoral arteries were measured. Standardized uptake value maximum and SUVmean for right atrial blood pool were also measured as the background. Average SUVmax, average SUVmean, average SUVmax/background ratio, and average SUVmean/background ratio were compared between subject groups for all segments. Presence or absence of macroscopic calcification on CT images for each arterial segment based on visual qualitative assessment was also noted and compared. For statistical analysis, two-sided t-test was used for continuous variables, and chi-square test was used for categorical variables. We considered a P value of <0.05 as statistically significant.; Results: Average SUVmax and SUVmean were statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD than in controls in all arterial segments. Average SUVmax/background ratios were statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD compared to normal controls in all arterial segments except for the left femoral artery. Average SUVmean/background ratios were statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD compared to normal controls in all arterial segments except for the right and left femoral arteries. Presence of calcification on CT was more frequently encountered in all arterial segments in subjects with ESRD, and was statistically significantly greater for the aortic arch, descending aorta, and right and left femoral arteries.; Conclusion: SUV measurements representing the atherosclerotic inflammatory changes and macroscopic atherosclerotic calcifications appear to be accelerated in subjects with ESRD on hemodialysis compared to normal controls. Fluorine-18 FDG PET/CT is a valuable diagnostic tool for verifying and quantifying accelerated atherosclerosis secondary to ESRD.;

AB  - Gender differences exist in clinical outcomes after routine percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but studies reporting such outcomes after chronic total occlusion (CTO) PCI are limited. We assessed the characteristics and outcomes of female patients undergoing CTO PCI. We retrospectively analyzed a dedicated national (United Kingdom) prospective CTO database from 2011 to 2015 for outcomes and characteristics of female patients undergoing CTO PCI (unmatched and propensity matched). Female patients constituted 20.5% (n = 260 of 1,271) of the unmatched cohort and 33.3% (n = 233 of 699) of the matched cohort and were more likely to be older (women aged >70 years, 48% in the unmatched and 45% in the matched cohort). An increased inhospital complication rate was observed in female patients (unmatched: 10% women vs 4.45% men, p = 0.0012, and matched 9.87% women vs 3.86% men, p = 0.0032). Coronary perforation, bleeding, and contrast-induced nephropathy were more frequently observed in female patients. Femoral access site with >6 French sheath was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Presence of calcification in the CTO artery was associated with coronary perforation (grade III) in female patients in the matched cohort (p = 0.007). Female patients undergoing CTO PCI were older and experienced increased of inhospital complications. Increased awareness of these complications could influence the selection of access site and sheath size, the need for prehydration, judicious choice of balloon size, collateral selection, and wire placement in female patients undergoing CTO PCI.; Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The impact of lesion calcium on long-term outcomes after drug-eluting stent implantation has not been adequately addressed. In 10,595 patients (16,803 lesions) who were exclusively treated with sirolimus-eluting stents in the j-Cypher registry, 5-year outcomes were compared between patients with ≥1 lesion with moderate or severe calcification (the calcium group) and those with noncalcified lesions only (the noncalcium group). Analyses were stratified by hemodialysis (HD) status (non-HD stratum [calcium n = 3,191, noncalcium n = 6,824] and HD stratum [calcium n = 415, noncalcium n = 165]). Adjusted risk in the calcium group for death and target lesion revascularization was significant in the non-HD stratum (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.52, p <0.0001, and HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.36, p = 0.003) and the HD stratum (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.86, p = 0.02, and HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.36, p <0.0001). Risk for definite stent thrombosis tended to be higher in the calcium group in the HD stratum (HR 5.05, 95% CI 0.66 to 38.9, p = 0.12) but not in then non-HD stratum (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.67, p = 0.41). The use of rotational atherectomy in patients with severe calcification did not have a significant impact on the cumulative incidence of target lesion revascularization in the non-HD stratum (17.7% [n = 268] with vs 18.2% [n = 588] without rotational atherectomy, p = 0.68) and the HD stratum (54.7% [n = 115] with vs 51.9% [n = 118] without rotational atherectomy, p = 0.19). In conclusion, regardless of HD status, patients with calcified lesions have increased long-term risk for death and target lesion revascularization after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation.; Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Administration of a large amount of contrast volume during chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may lead to contrast-induced nephropathy.; Methods: We examined the association of clinical, angiographic and procedural variables with contrast volume administered during 1330 CTO-PCI procedures performed at 12 experienced United States centers.; Results: Technical and procedural success was 90% and 88%, respectively, and mean contrast volume was 289 ± 138 mL. Approximately 33% of patients received >320 mL of contrast (high contrast utilization group). On univariable analysis, male gender (P=.01), smoking (P=.01), prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (P=.04), moderate or severe calcification (P=.01), moderate or severe tortuosity (P=.04), proximal cap ambiguity (P=.01), distal cap at a bifurcation (P<.001), side branch at the proximal cap (P<.001), blunt/no stump (P=.01), occlusion length (P<.001), higher J-CTO score (P=.02), use of antegrade dissection and reentry or retrograde approach (P<.001), ad hoc CTO-PCI (P=.04), dual arterial access (P<.001), and 8 Fr guide catheters (P<.001) were associated with higher contrast volume; conversely, diabetes mellitus (P=.01) and in-stent restenosis (P=.01) were associated with lower contrast volume. On multivariable analysis, moderate/severe calcification (P=.04), distal cap at a bifurcation (P<.001), ad hoc CTO-PCI (P<.001), dual arterial access (P=.01), 8 Fr guide catheters (P=.02), and use of antegrade dissection/reentry or the retrograde approach (P<.001) were independently associated with higher contrast use, whereas diabetes (P=.02), larger target vessel diameter (P=.03), and presence of "interventional" collaterals (P<.001) were associated with lower contrast utilization.; Conclusions: Several baseline clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics are associated with higher contrast volume administration during CTO-PCI.;

AB  - Background: Decreased coronary flow reserve (CFR) is a marker of endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery calcification and inflammation, well-known cardiovascular risk factors in haemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation of coronary artery calcification scores (CACS) with CFR in HD patients.; Methods: Sixty-four end-stage renal failure patients were enrolled in this study (38 males, 26 females). Thirty-nine healthy subjects (22 males, 17 females) were included in the control group. Biochemical parameters and acute-phase inflammation marker [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] of patients were recorded before dialysis. The CACS were measured by electron beam computerized tomography method. CFR recordings were performed by trans-thoracic Doppler echocardiography. The relationship between CACS and CFR was evaluated.; Results: The mean CACS was 281 +/- 589 and 29 patients had CACS < 10. Patients with CACS > 10 had significantly lower CFR values compared to patients with CACS < 10 (1.56 +/- 0.38 vs 1.84 +/- 0.53, P = 0.024). However, there was no difference in hs-CRP values between the groups. CFR was negatively correlated with CACS (r = -0.276, P = 0.030). In multiple stepwise regression analysis, CACS was found to be an independent variable for predicting CFR (P = 0.048). During a follow-up of 18 months, 10 patients had experience of cardiovascular events. Patients with CACS > 10 had significantly higher event rate [34.5% (10/29) vs 0% (0/24)] compared to those with CACS < 10 (P = 0.001). Patients who developed cardiovascular events had significantly higher mean CACS and lower CFR values than the remaining group (P = 0.019 and P = 0.039). All of four patients who died during follow-up were in the CFR < 2 and CACS > 10 groups.; Conclusions: CACS was associated with CFR in HD patients. However, we did not find any association of inflammation with CACS and CFR. This association between CFR and CACS might indicate two different (anatomical and functional) aspects of the common pathophysiology of the arterial system in HD patients.;

AB  - Purpose: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular (CV) events in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), a non-invasive measure of large artery stiffness, also predicts CV events in RTR. The study investigated the relationship between CAC and PWV in RTR and assessed the performance of PWV measurement in predicting CAC.; Patients/methods: The study was performed as cross-sectional analysis in 104 RTR. CAC was determined as total calcium score (CS) and calcium mass (CM). Carotid-femoral PWV was also measured. Sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to assess the performance of PWV as diagnostic test for presence of CAC.; Results: CAC was found in 69% of participants. PWV was higher in RTR with CAC than in RTR without CAC (10.2±2.2 vs. 8.6±15; p<0.001). In univariate analysis CS was significantly correlated with age, duration of hypertension, waist circumference, PWV, hemoglobin concentration, and serum glucose. In multiple linear regression analysis CS was independently associated with age only, but not with PWV. Sensitivity and specificity of PWV>7.6m/s as cut-off for detecting CAC>0 was 0.889 and 0.406, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of PWV>10.2m/s as cut-off for detecting severe CAC (CS>400) was 0.319 and 0.969, respectively.; Conclusions: The study confirmed high prevalence of coronary artery calcification in renal transplant recipients. The study does not support the hypothesis that aortic stiffness is independently associated with coronary artery calcification in RTR. PWV measurement may be useful in excluding severe CAC in RTR.; Copyright © 2015 Medical University of Bialystok. Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no studies on the prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a median urine protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification, measured by electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, male gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the severity of calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies need to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery calcification in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.;

AB  - Objectives: Kidney transplantation (KT) is associated with increased incidence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and posttransplant diabetes mellitus that promote the development of coronary artery calcification (CAC). The aim of the current study was to elucidate the extent of CAC and its risk factors among KT patients.; Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the severity of CAC in our KT patients. Multidetector computed tomography was performed to assess the coronary artery calcium score (CACS). Patients were further stratified according to the CACS as: group 1: 0-10, group 2: 11-100, group 3: 101-300, group 4: 301-1000, and group 5: >1000. Clinical as well as demographic data were compared among groups. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine factors that were associated with CAC.; Results: A total of 99 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 53.5 ± 11.8 years and duration of follow-up post-KT was 11.2 ± 5.9 years. The distribution of CACS in groups 1 through 5 was: 41.4%, 20.2%, 11.1%, 15.2%, and 12.1%, respectively. A significantly higher CACS was found in males, patients with pretransplant diabetes mellitus, older current age, older age at KT, hypertension, higher body weight, higher fasting plasma sugar level and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Twenty-nine (29.3%) patients fulfilled criteria for metabolic syndrome (MS). The CACS was significantly higher in patients with MS than in those without MS. An incremental CACS was found to be correlated with increasing number of MS components (P = .003). Multivariate linear regression revealed that female gender, current age, hypertension, and HDL cholesterol were associated with CAC.; Conclusion: KT was associated with high CACS in a significant proportion of patients with long-term follow-up. Several risk factors were identified. Some of them were potentially treatable and should be taken into consideration in the management of KT recipients.; Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in renal transplant recipients. Although renal transplant recipients frequently undergo cardiac functional tests prior to surgery, coronary atherosclerosis can remain undetected. Coronary artery calcification (CAC), an early marker of atherosclerosis can be quantified using EBCT. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent and characteristics of CAC at the time of renal transplantation. We evaluated 79 consecutive incident asymptomatic renal transplant recipients. Patients were mostly White (62%), male (54%) and had a deceased donor renal transplant (61%). The mean age was 47 (12.1) years. Sixty-five percentage of subjects had CAC. The mean CAC score was 331.5 (562.4) with a median of 43.3. Older age, presence of diabetes, not having a preemptive transplant, deceased donor transplantation and hypercholesterolemia were significantly associated with presence of CAC univariately. Median CAC scores were significantly increased in subjects with diabetes (127.8 vs. 28.9, p=0.05), exposed to dialysis (102.9 vs. 3.7, p<0.001) and deceased donor recipients (169.7 vs. 7.5, p=0.02). Using multiple logistic regression, age and time on dialysis were significantly associated with the presence of CAC at the time of transplant. In summary, CAC is prevalent in patients undergoing kidney transplant. CAC may be a method to identify renal transplant recipients at increased risk for future cardiovascular events.;

AB  - Objective: Coronary artery calcification has been associated with higher mortality in coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to correlate coronary artery calcification score (CACS) with all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities in hemodialysis (HD) patients.; Design, Setting, Subjects: A survival analysis was conducted in 200 HD patients. CACS was assessed by multidetector-row computed tomography and stratified as tertiles: group 1 (0∼105 U), group 2 (110∼1067 U), and group 3 (1094∼15481 U). The duration of follow-up was 7 years and 4 months. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD duration were performed to examine the impact of CACS on survival.; Main Outcome Measure: All-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were measured.; Results: The cumulative all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly lower than those of groups 2 and 3 (all-cause mortality: 7.6% vs. 43.3% and 52.2%, respectively, cardiovascular mortality: 3.0% vs. 22.4% and 26.9%, respectively). Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD duration revealed that all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly lower than those of groups 2 and 3.; Conclusion: CACS is helpful to predict prognosis of HD patients independently of age and HD duration.; Copyright © 2012 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Background: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of CAC scores for the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after cardiac catheterization in non-dialyzed CKD patients.; Methods: The present study evaluated a total of 140 CKD patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the optimal cut-off value of the CAC score, which was graded by a non-triggered, routine diagnostic chest computed tomography scan: CAC score ≥8 (high CAC group); and CAC score <8 (low CAC group). CIN was defined as an increase of >10 % in the baseline serum cystatin C level at 24 h after contrast administration.; Results: The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate levels were 41.1 mL/min/1.73 m2, and the mean contrast dose administered was 37.5 mL. Patients with high CAC scores exhibited a higher incidence of CIN than patients with low CAC scores (25.5 vs. 3.2 %, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment for confounders, the CAC score predicted CIN (odds ratio 1.68, 95 % confidence interval 1.28-2.21, p < 0.001). Moreover, the C-index for CIN prediction significantly increased when the CAC scores were added to the Mehran risk score (0.855 vs. 0.760, p = 0.023).; Conclusion: CAC scores, as evaluated using semi-quantitative methods, are a simple and powerful predictor of CIN. Incorporating the CAC score in the Mehran risk score significantly improved the predictive ability to predict CIN incidence.;

AB  - Background/aims: This study examined the role of diabetes mellitus on determining left ventricular function by evaluating coronary artery diameter in patients with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis treatment.; Methods: We studied 12 diabetic and 12 nondiabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis treatment without significant stenoses of the major epicardial coronary arteries. Patients were matched for age, sex distribution, duration of dialysis and incidence of major coronary risk factors. Left ventricular wall thickness (septal and posterior walls) and left ventricular diameter (end-diastolic and systolic phases), were measured by echocardiography. Hemodynamic measurements and coronary angiography were performed on the day of hemodialysis and coronary artery diameter at the proximal and mid portion of three major coronary arteries were measured using the computed densitometry method.; Results: Right and left anterior descending and circumflex coronary artery diameters were all significantly smaller and the frequency of coronary artery calcification was higher in diabetic (58%) compared to nondiabetic (8%) patients. Although there were no significant differences in left ventricular wall thickness, left ventricular diameter, mean right atrial pressure and cardiac index between the two groups, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in diabetic (22 +/- 9 mm Hg) compared to nondiabetic patients (14 +/- 5 mm Hg).; Conclusion: Despite that there were no significant stenoses of the major epicardial coronary arteries, diffuse luminal narrowing of the epicardial coronary arteries in diabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis treatment was associated with increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.;

AB  - Background: Individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have highly prevalent and severe vascular and valvular calcification. We undertook this study to test the hypothesis that vascular and valvular calcification begins and is often severe long before diabetic renal disease progresses to ESRD.; Methods: A total of 32 nondialyzed individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic renal disease (albumin excretion rate>30 microg/min) [mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 49.8 +/- 6.1 mL/min/1.73 m2] were identified and compared with a group of 18 normoalbuminuric diabetics. We used 3:1 matching to identify 95 nondiabetic controls without renal disease, matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and the presence/absence of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and known coronary artery disease (CAD).; Results: Using electron beam computed tomography (CT), the prevalence of coronary artery calcification was significantly greater among diabetic renal disease individuals (prevalence, 94% vs. 59%, P < 0.001; median score, 238 vs. 10, P < 0.001) than the nondiabetic controls. The coronary artery calcification scores were significantly more severe among diabetic renal disease individuals than either the diabetic or nondiabetic controls. Among individuals with diabetic renal disease, the coronary artery calcification and aortic wall calcification scores were several-fold greater among those with known CAD than among those without. There was also a significantly greater prevalence of aortic and mitral valve calcification among diabetic renal disease individuals than nondiabetic controls (aortic, 23% vs. 6%, P = 0.03; mitral, 25% vs. 2%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis using all three groups reproduced these findings and also consistently identified age and diabetic renal disease as additional predictors for the presence or severity of coronary artery and aortic wall calcification.; Conclusion: In this first, systematic analysis among nondialyzed individuals with diabetic renal disease, these data demonstrate that vascular and valvular calcification is present and often severe long before the disease progresses to ESRD. The data also suggest that the coronary artery and aortic wall calcification may represent atherosclerosis.;

AB  - Background: We examined the association between coronary artery calcifications, atherosclerotic burden, and plaque morphology in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and non-ESRD patients undergoing 64-slice multidetector coronary computed tomographic angiography.; Methods: The prevalence, extent, and severity of coronary atherosclerosis, calcium burden, and plaque morphology were determined in ESRD patients (n=48), and calcium score-matched (n=39) and unmatched non-ESRD controls (n=29) undergoing computed tomographic angiography using dedicated plaque imaging software.; Results: ESRD was associated with a higher prevalence of calcified plaques (55.9% vs. 38.3 and 26.9% in the non-ESRD groups, P=0.005) and higher plaque calcium content (43.7 vs. 34.5% and 33.9%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the calcium score correlated well with plaque burden (r=0.403 in ESRD vs. r=0.433 in non-ESRD, P<0.001 for both), and the diagnostic association between the calcium score and atherosclerotic lesions was good irrespective of ESRD (area under the curve 0.771 vs. 0.804; P=0.574).; Conclusion: ESRD is associated with diffuse atherosclerosis and calcific plaque morphology. Nonetheless, the association between the calcium score and atherosclerotic burden is not affected by the presence of ESRD.;

AB  - Coronary arteries in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been shown to exhibit more extensive atherosclerosis and calcium. We aimed to assess characteristics of coronary plaque in hemodialysis (HD)-dependent patients using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This was a multicenter, retrospective study of 124 patients with stable angina who underwent OCT imaging. Sixty-two HD-dependent patients who underwent pre-intervention OCT for coronary artery disease were compared 1:1 with a cohort of patients without CKD, matched for age, diabetes mellitus, gender, and culprit vessel. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Pre-intervention OCT imaging identified 62 paired culprit, 53 paired non-culprit, and 19 paired distal vessel lesions. Lesion length, minimum lumen area, and area stenosis were similar between groups. The HD-dependent group had greater mean calcium arcs in culprit (54.3° vs 26.4°, p = 0.004) and non-culprit lesions (34.3° vs 24.5°, p = 0.02) and greater maximum calcium arc in distal vessel segments (101.6° vs 0°, p = 0.03). There were no differences in lipid arcs between groups. There was a higher prevalence of thin intimal calcium, defined as an arc of calcium >30° within intima <0.5 mm thick, in patients in the HD-dependent group (41.9% vs 4.8%, p <0.001). There was a higher prevalence of calcified nodules in the HD-dependent group (24.2% vs 9.7%, p = 0.049) but no differences in medial calcification or thin-cap fibroatheroma. In conclusion, in this OCT study, HD-dependent patients, compared with matched patients without CKD, had more extensively distributed coronary calcium and uniquely, a higher prevalence of non-atherosclerotic thin intimal calcium. This thin intimal calcium may cause an overestimation of calcium burden by intravascular ultrasound and may contribute to the lack of correlation between increased coronary artery calcification scores with long-term outcomes in patients with CKD.; Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: The differences in the coronary plaque characteristics between patients with mild chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30-59 ml·min(-1) · 1.73 m(-2)) and those without CKD (eGFR ≥60) by 320-row area detector computed tomography (CT) have not been studied.; Methods and Results: We enrolled 487 patients undergoing coronary CT angiography with suspected stable coronary artery disease (mean age: 66.6±10.8 years, 131 with mild CKD) and analyzed 6,352 segments. All coronary plaques were characterized for the presence of vessel remodeling, plaque consistency and the disposition of coronary calcification, and a plaque with positive vessel remodeling and/or low-attenuation was defined as high risk. The number of diseased segments per patient was higher in mild CKD patients than in those without CKD (4.61±3.83 vs. 2.95±3.11, P<0.0001). The prevalence of severe stenosis (≥70% luminal diameter) was significantly higher in cases of mild CKD than in no CKD (35.1% vs. 19.4%, P=0.0003), but there was no significant difference in the prevalence of high-risk plaque (13.0% vs. 9.8%, P=0.3189).; Conclusions: The severity of coronary artery stenosis was higher in the patients with mild CKD, though there was no significant difference in the prevalence of high-risk plaque. We suggest that the high risk of coronary events in patients with CKD is related to the severity of stenosis rather than to the characteristics of plaque.;

AB  - Objectives: This study sought to evaluate the impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on coronary atherosclerotic plaque composition, morphology, and outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).; Background: CKD patients presenting with ACS are at increased risk for adverse events. Whether or not this increased risk reflects differences in coronary plaque composition remains unknown.; Methods: In the PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of Events in the Coronary Tree) study, patients presenting with ACS in whom percutaneous coronary intervention was successful underwent 3-vessel grayscale and radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound imaging. Lesions were prospectively characterized, and patients were followed for a median of 3.4 years. We conducted a patient-level and lesion-level analysis of study participants by comparing intravascular ultrasound parameters of untreated nonculprit lesions in patients with and without CKD.; Results: Patients with CKD (n = 73, 11.3%) were older, more often female and diabetic compared to those without CKD (n = 573). Nonculprit lesions in patients with (n = 280) versus without (n = 2,390) CKD were more likely to have plaque burden ≥ 70% (11.8% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.05) and minimal luminal area ≤ 4.0 mm(2) (25.9% vs. 19.2%, p = 0.005). The percentage of plaque comprised of necrotic core (15.0% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.0001) and dense calcium (8.2% vs. 6.4%, p < 0.0001) was higher while fibrous tissue (57.7% vs. 59.8%, p < 0.0001) was lower in CKD versus non-CKD lesions. The 3-year composite rate of cardiac death, cardiac arrest, or myocardial infarction (15.1% vs. 3.3%, p < 0.0001) was significantly higher in patients with than in those without CKD, although there were no differences in the rates of events adjudicated to nonculprit lesions.; Conclusions: Following percutaneous coronary intervention of all culprit lesions in ACS, patients with versus without CKD have more extensive and severe atherosclerosis remaining in their coronary tree with plaque composed of greater necrotic core and less fibrous tissue. These influences resulted in nonsignificantly different rates of non-culprit lesion-related adverse events, although cardiac death, arrest, or myocardial infarction were more common in patients with CKD.; Copyright © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a cytokine that regulates bone resorption, has been implicated in the process of vascular calcification and stiffness.; Design, Setting, Participants,& Measurements: Serum OPG was measured in 351 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from one site of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. Cortical bone mineral content (BMC) was measured by quantitative computed tomography in the tibia. Multivariable linear regression was used to test the association between serum OPG and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, measures of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and pulse wave velocity.; Results: Higher serum OPG levels were associated with older age, female gender, greater systolic BP, lower estimated GFR, and lower serum albumin. OPG was not associated with measures of abnormal bone or mineral metabolism including serum phosphorus, albumin-corrected serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, or cortical BMC. Among 226 participants with concurrent aortic pulse wave velocity measurements, increasing tertiles of serum OPG were associated with higher aortic pulse wave velocity after adjustment for demographics, traditional vascular risk factors, and nontraditional risk factors such as estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum phosphate, corrected serum calcium, presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein or after additional adjustment for cortical BMC in a subset (n = 161).; Conclusions: These data support a strong relationship between serum OPG and arterial stiffness independent of many potential confounders including traditional cardiovascular risk factors, abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and inflammation.;

AB  - Objective: The inflammatory process of aortic stenosis involves the differentiation of aortic valve myofibroblasts into osteoblasts. Osteopontin, a proinflammatory glycoprotein, both stimulates differentiation of myofibroblasts and regulates the deposition of calcium by osteoblasts. Osteopontin levels are increased in patients with such conditions as end-stage renal disease, ectopic calcification, and autoimmune disease. We hypothesized that increased plasma osteopontin levels might be associated with the presence of aortic valve calcification and stenosis.; Methods: Venous blood from volunteers older than 65 years undergoing routine echocardiographic analysis or aortic valve surgery for aortic stenosis was collected. Plasma osteopontin levels were measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The presence of aortic stenosis was defined as an aortic valve area of less than 2.0 cm(2). Aortic valve calcification was assessed by using a validated echocardiographic grading system (1, none; 2, mild; 3, moderate; 4, severe). Comparisons were performed with nonpaired t tests.; Results: Aortic stenosis was present in 23 patients (mean age, 78 years) and was absent in 7 patients (mean age, 72 years). Aortic valve calcification scores were 3.5 +/- 0.6 and 1.3 +/- 0.5 in patients with and without aortic stenosis, respectively (P < .001). Patients with no or mild aortic valve calcification had lower osteopontin levels compared with patients with moderate or severe aortic valve calcification (406.1 +/- 165.8 vs 629.5 +/- 227.5 ng/mL, P = .01). Similarly, patients with aortic stenosis had higher osteopontin levels compared with patients without aortic stenosis (652.2 +/- 218.7 vs 379.7 +/- 159.9 ng/mL, P < .01).; Conclusion: Increased levels of plasma osteopontin are associated with the presence of aortic valve calcification and stenosis. These findings suggest that osteopontin might play a functional role in the pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis.;

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pre-existing radial artery macrocalcification (Mönckeberg type of arteriosclerosis) on patency rates of radiocephalic fistulas (RCFs) in diabetic end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing hemodialysis.; Methods: In this observational prospective study, the long-term patency rates (primary outcome measures) of RCFs in ESRD diabetics who had Mönckeberg radial (±brachial) artery disease (calcified [C] group) were compared with those obtained in ESRD diabetics who had healthy, noncalcified vessels before RCF construction (healthy [H] group). Vessel calcification was assessed by plain two-dimensional radiography. For inclusion in the C-group, uniform linear railroad track-type macrocalcifications of at least 6 cm in length, in the medial wall of the radial artery ipsilateral to RCF creation, were required. Patients were included in the H-group if the radial artery ipsilateral to the RCF creation was free of any macrocalcification, of either intima or media type. Any intimal-like plaque with irregular and patchy distribution was an exclusion criterion for both groups. Patients in both groups also were required to have suitable upper limb vascular anatomy on the basis of ultrasound imaging before RCF creation (cephalic vein of minimum diameter of 1.6 mm, without stenosis or thrombosis in all outflow areas, and radial artery of minimum diameter of 1.5 mm, without proximal hemodynamically significant stenosis). Secondary outcome measures included all-cause mortality. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used for comparison between groups.; Results: The arm radiograph at the site of possible fistula construction showed abnormality in 39 patients (C-group, 47 RCFs), whereas 33 patients had noncalcified ("healthy") vascular anatomy (H-group, 40 RCFs). Mean duration of the diabetic disease at the time of RCF creation was 8.9 ± 5.6 years (range, 2-25 years) for the H-group and 14 ± 9.9 years (range, 1-40 years) for the C-group (P = .018). The mean follow-up period for H-group and C-group was 51.9 ± 35.9 months (range, 0.1-126 months) and 26.1 ± 31.6 months (range, 0.1-144 months), respectively (P = .0006). Forty-four patients died during the follow-up period. Primary patency rates at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months for C-group vs H-group were 50.2% vs 80%, 36.5% vs 72.3%, 32.4% vs 67.9%, and 29.1% vs 59.3% (P = .0019). Respective values for secondary patency rates were 52.4% vs 87.5%, 40.9% vs 82.4%, 36.6% vs 78.1%, and 33.2% vs 72.8% (P = .00064). Patient survival rates at 24 and 48 months were 56.1% and 46.4% for C-group and 92.4% and 67.4% for H-group, respectively (P = .05).; Conclusions: ESRD diabetics with radial artery Mönckeberg calcifications receiving RCFs had worse late clinical outcomes compared with ESRD diabetics with healthy distal arm vessels receiving the same access. The long-term benefit of RCFs may be lost in diabetics with extensively calcified vessels, and preferably the brachial artery should be used instead.; Copyright © 2014 Society for Vascular Surgery.

AB  - Background: Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) are prone to neointimal hyperplasia leading to AVG failure. We hypothesized that pre-existing pathologic abnormalities of the vessels used to create AVGs (including venous intimal hyperplasia, arterial intimal hyperplasia, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial calcification) are associated with inferior AVG survival.; Study Design: Prospective observational study.; Setting& Participants: Patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing placement of a new AVG at a large medical center who had vascular specimens obtained at the time of surgery (n = 76).; Predictor: Maximal intimal thickness of the arterial and venous intima, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial medial calcification.; Outcome& Measurements: Unassisted primary AVG survival (time to first intervention) and frequency of AVG interventions.; Results: 55 patients (72%) underwent interventions and 148 graft interventions occurred during 89.9 years of follow-up (1.65 interventions per graft-year). Unassisted primary AVG survival was not associated significantly with arterial intimal thickness (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.40-1.27; P = 0.3), venous intimal thickness (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37-1.10; P = 0.1), severe arterial medial fibrosis (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-1.06; P = 0.6), or severe arterial calcification (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.37-1.31; P = 0.3). The frequency of AVG interventions per year was associated inversely with arterial intimal thickness (relative risk [RR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.16-3.42; P < 0.001 for thickness <10 vs. >25 μm), venous intimal thickness (RR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.39-3.20; P < 0.001 for thickness <5 vs. >10 μm), arterial medial fibrosis (RR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.96-5.13; P < 0.001 for fibrosis <70% vs. ≥70%), and arterial calcification (RR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.31-3.43; P = 0.001 for <10% vs. ≥10% calcification).; Limitations: Single-center study. Study may be underpowered to demonstrate differences in unassisted primary AVG survival.; Conclusions: Pre-existing vascular pathologic abnormalities in patients with chronic kidney disease may not be associated significantly with unassisted primary AVG survival. However, vascular intimal hyperplasia, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial calcification may be associated with a decreased frequency of AVG interventions.; Copyright © 2013 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with vascular calcification in patients treated with hemodialysis.; Methods: As a cross-sectional study, 126 patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) in our hospital were enrolled in this study. According to the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, the patients were divided into 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency group (30 ηg/ml or less than 30 ηg/ml) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D normal level group (>30 ηg/ml). All of the subjects underwent lateral lumbar, pelvis and hands X-ray examination to score the degree of calcification (Kauppila score).; Results: Among the 126 patients treated with MHD, there were 110 patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and 16 patients with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. There was no significant difference found in gender, age, age of dialysis, active vitamin D treatment, blood calcium, blood phosphorus, blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other related indicators between the two groups. The incidence of vascular calcification in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was significantly higher than that in patients with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (P = 0.001). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level had a negative correlation with the calcification score (r = 0.193, P = 0.193). Logistic regression showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not a risk factor for vascular calcification in MHD patients. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is generally low in patients with MHD.; Conclusions: Patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency have a higher incidence of vascular calcification with a markedly negative correlation. Thus, for the patients treated with MHD, vitamin D deficiency should be actively treated.;

AB  - Valvular calcification is common in the setting of end-stage kidney disease and is associated with increased risks for cardiovascular disease events. It is unknown whether the prevalence of valvular calcification is increased in milder kidney disease after accounting for cardiovascular risk factors. Participants who attended the sixth examination of the Framingham Offspring Study (1995 to 1998) were eligible. Kidney function was estimated by GFR using the simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. Mitral annular calcification (MAC), aortic sclerosis, and aortic annular calcification were assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography. Logistic regression was used to examine the odds of valvular calcification among participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD; GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). A total of 3047 participants (52% women; mean age 59 +/- 10 yr) were available for analysis. CKD was present in 8.6% (n = 262) of the sample. Among participants with valve/annular calcification (n = 284; 9.3%), 20% had CKD, compared with 7% in patients without valvular calcification. After adjustment for age, gender, systolic and diastolic BP, hypertension treatment, total/HDL cholesterol, body mass index, diabetes, smoking status, and cardiovascular disease, participants with CKD had a 60% increased odds of MAC (odds ratio 1.6; 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.5). There was no significant association between CKD and either aortic sclerosis or aortic annular calcification (odds ratio 1.1 and 1.1, respectively). After age and gender adjustment, the combination of both CKD and MAC was associated with a three-fold increased risk for death compared with those with neither condition (P = 0.0004). In the community, CKD is associated with presence of MAC before the onset of ESRD. Further research is warranted to understand whether traditional and novel vascular risk factor burden, as well as metabolic derangements found in early kidney disease, can account for the CKD-MAC association.;

AB  - Purpose: Significant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic dialysis patients. Identifying these high risk patients is warranted and may improve the prognosis of this vulnerable patient group. Routine catheterization of incident dialysis patients has been proposed, but is considered too invasive. CT-angiography may therefore be more appropriate. However, extensive coronary calcification, often present in this patient group, might hamper adequate lumen evaluation. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of CT-angiography in this patient group.; Methods: For this analysis all patients currently participating in the ICD2 trial (ISRCTN20479861), with no history of PCI or CABG were included. The major epicardial vessels were evaluated on a segment basis (segment 1-3, 5-8, 11 and 13) by a team consisting of an interventional and an imaging specialist. Segments were scored as not significant, significant and not interpretable.; Results: A total of 70 dialysis patients, with a mean age of 66±8 yrs and predominantly male (70%) were included. The median calcium score was 623 [79, 1619]. Over 90% of the analyzed segments were considered interpretable. The incidence of significant CAD on CT was 43% and was associated with cardiovascular events during follow-up. The incidence of cardiovascular events after 2-years follow-up: 36% vs. 0% in patients with no significant CAD (p<0.01).; Conclusion: Despite the high calcium scores CT-angiography is feasible for the evaluation of the extent of CAD in dialysis patients. Moreover the presence of significant CAD on CT was associated with events during follow-up.;

AB  - Background: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is known to act as a potent local inhibitor of vascular calcifications. However, in order to be active, MGP must be phosphorylated and carboxylated, with this last process being dependent on vitamin K. The present study focused on the inactive form of MGP (dephosphorylated and uncarboxylated: dp-ucMGP) in a population of hemodialyzed (HD) patients. Results found in subjects being treated or not with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) were compared and the relationship between dp-ucMGP levels and the vascular calcification score were assessed.; Methods: One hundred sixty prevalent HD patients were enrolled into this observational cohort study, including 23 who were receiving VKA treatment. The calcification score was determined (using the Kauppila method) and dp-ucMGP levels were measured using the automated iSYS method.; Results: dp-ucMGP levels were much higher in patients being treated with VKA and little overlap was found with those not being treated (5604 [3758; 7836] vs. 1939 [1419; 2841] pmol/L, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, treatment with VKA was the most important variable explaining variation in dp-ucMGP levels even when adjusting for all other significant variables. In the 137 untreated patients, dp-ucMGP levels were significantly (p < 0.05) associated both in the uni- and multivariate analysis with age, body mass index, plasma levels of albumin, C-reactive protein, and FGF-23, and the vascular calcification score.; Conclusion: We confirmed that the concentration of dp-ucMGP was higher in HD patients being treated with VKA. We observed a significant correlation between dp-ucMGP concentration and the calcification score. Our data support the theoretical role of MGP in the development of vascular calcifications. We confirmed the potential role of the inactive form of MGP in assessing the vitamin K status of the HD patients.; Trial Registration: B707201215885.;

AB  - Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery increases length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. A significant number of patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures require perioperative intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. Use of an IABP has been linked to an increased incidence of perioperative renal dysfunction and death. This might be due to dislodgement of atherosclerotic material in the descending thoracic aorta (DTA). Therefore, we retrospectively studied the correlation between DTA atheroma, AKI and in-hospital mortality.; Methods: A total of 454 patients were retrospectively matched to one of four groups: -IABP/-DTA atheroma, +IABP/-DTA atheroma, -IABP/+DTA atheroma, +IABP/+DTA atheroma. Patients were then matched according to presence/absence of DTA atheroma, presence/absence of IABP, performed surgical procedure, age, gender and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). DTA atheroma was assessed through standard transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) imaging studies of the descending thoracic aorta.; Results: Basic patient characteristics, except for age and gender, did not differ between groups. Perioperative AKI in patients with -DTA atheroma/+IABP was 5.1% versus 1.7% in patients with -DTA atheroma/-IABP. In patients with +DTA atheroma/+IABP the incidence of AKI was 12.6% versus 5.1% in patients with +DTA atheroma/-IABP. In-hospital mortality in patients with +DTA atheroma/-IABP was 3.4% versus 8.4% with +DTA atheroma/+IABP. In patients with +DTA atheroma/+IABP in hospital mortality was 20.2% versus 6.4% with +DTA atheroma/-IABP. Multivariate logistic regression identified DTA atheroma>1 mm (P=*0.002, odds ratio (OR)=4.13, confidence interval (CI)=1.66 to 10.30), as well as IABP support (P=*0.015, OR=3.04, CI=1.24 to 7.45) as independent predictors of perioperative AKI and increased in-hospital mortality. DTA atheroma in conjunction with IABP significantly increased the risk of developing acute kidney injury (P=0.0016) and in-hospital mortality (P=0.0001) when compared to control subjects without IABP and without DTA atheroma.; Conclusions: Perioperative IABP and DTA atheroma are independent predictors of perioperative AKI and in-hospital mortality. Whether adding an IABP in patients with severe DTA calcification increases their risk of developing AKI and mortality postoperatively cannot be clearly answered in this study. Nevertheless, when IABP and DTA are combined, patients are more likely to develop AKI and to die postoperatively in comparison to patients without IABP and DTA atheroma.;

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence and extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 and 4 comparing those with and without diabetes. We also wished to determine if the presence of peripheral artery calcification (PAC) would assist in identifying patients positive for CAC.; Methods: CAC was detected by multi-slice computed tomography and PAC was detected by plain foot radiography. Study population was 112 patients, 54 with diabetes and 58 without, all asymptomatic for heart disease. Demographic and laboratory data were collected and analysed.; Results: The prevalence of CAC in CKD patients was 76 and 46.5% with and without diabetes, respectively. Patients with diabetes had higher CAC scores with more vessels affected, and in the presence of diabetes men and women had the same risk for CAC. In patients with diabetes, age was the unique explanatory variable for detecting the presence of CAC, while age and smoking history predicted severity. In patients without diabetes, age, male gender, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum phosphate levels predicted the presence of CAC, while parathyroid hormone predicted severity. Prevalence of PAC was 63 and 12% in subjects with and without diabetes. PAC detected by foot radiography was not an adequate alternative-screening marker for identifying patients with CAC.; Conclusions: CAC is common in CKD stages 3 and 4 patients, especially in men and women with diabetes.;

AB  - Background: In the general population, including those with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery calcification (CAC) correlates with atherosclerotic plaque burden. On the other hand, accumulating evidence suggests that disordered mineral metabolism significantly contributes to the vascular calcification in individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).; Methods: In order to determine the relative contribution of accelerated atherosclerosis and disordered mineral metabolism to CAC in chronic kidney disease, a pilot study of 90 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was done [age, 40-65 years; normoalbuminuria, N= 30; diabetic nephropathy (DN), N= 60].; Results: CAC was more prevalent and severe among individuals with DN compared to diabetic controls (odds ratio for prevalence 8.1, 95% CI 2.3-28.5; median scores, 66 vs. 4, P < 0.001). None of the 4 measures of disordered mineral metabolism evaluated in this study (serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and 1,25 di-hydroxy vitamin D levels) correlated with the prevalence or severity of CAC, or accounted for the differences seen between DN and diabetic controls. On the other hand, the difference in the severity of hypertension (number of antihypertensive medications) appeared to account for the differences in CAC burden seen between DN and diabetic controls.; Conclusion: This first such study of nondialyzed individuals with DN suggests that, unlike ESRD patients, the high CAC burden seen at earlier stages of diabetic chronic kidney disease is probably unrelated to disordered mineral metabolism. The relationship between the severity of hypertension and CAC burden provides a probable target for intervention in the predialysis phase of DN.;

AB  - In addition to the well-known traditional risk factors, uremia-related so-called novel risk factors and medications appear to affect coronary artery calcification in hemodialysis patients. This study was performed to evaluate coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, and to identify significantly related factors. We assessed CACS using Agatston Score by MDCT, sex, age, dialysis vintage, presence of diabetes mellitus, smoking history, presence of ≥100 ml urine volume/day, normalized protein catabolic rate, geriatric nutritional risk index, administration of active vitamin D3, cinacalcet, phosphate binders or antihypertensive agents, and circulation parameters including creatinine, albumin, corrected calcium and phosphate in 207 MHD patients. Coronary artery calcifications were observed in 192 patients (92.8%). In multivariate analysis, CACS showed direct associations with age (p < 0.001), dialysis vintage (p < 0.001) and presence of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), and an inverse association only with active vitamin D3 administration (p < 0.001) in MHD patients. Patients with active vitamin D3 showed significantly lower CACS than in those without it (1349.6 ± 1635.0 vs. 2475.6 ± 2646.6 H, p < 0.05). Older age, longer duration of dialysis and diabetes mellitus are risk factors and administration of active vitamin D3 is protective factor for coronary artery calcification in MHD patients.;

AB  - Background and Aim: Elevated serum phosphate and calcium-phosphate levels play an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular calcifications in uraemic patients and appear to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. We aimed to evaluate the effects of a partial replacement of food protein with a low-phosphorus and low-potassium whey protein concentrate on phosphate levels of dialysis patients with hyperphosphataemia.; Methods and Results: Twenty-seven patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis were studied for a 3-month period. In the intervention group (n = 15), food protein were replaced by 30 or 40 g of low-phosphorus and low-potassium protein concentrate aimed at limiting the phosphate intake. In the control group (n = 12) no changes were made to their usual diet. Anthropometric measurements, biochemical markers and dietary interviews were registered at baseline and during the follow-up period. From baseline to the end of the study, in the intervention group, serum phosphate and circulating intact parathyroid hormone levels lessened significantly (8.3 ± 1.2 mg/dL vs 5.7 ± 1.4 mg/dL and 488 ± 205 pg/ml vs 177 ± 100 pg/ml respectively; p < 0.05) with decreasing of phosphate and potassium intake. No significant differences were found in the control group. No significant changes were observed in serum albumin, calcium, potassium, Kt/V, body weight and body composition in both the intervention and control groups.; Conclusion: Dietary intake of phosphate mainly comes from protein sources, so dietary phosphorus restriction may lead to a protein/energy malnutrition in a dialysis patient. A phosphorus-controlled diet plan including a nutritional substitute resulted in serum phosphate and intact parathyroid hormone decrease without nutritional status modifications in dialysis patients.; Copyright © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim/hypothesis: Although derangements of calcium and phosphate control have been emphasized as important risk factors for vascular calcification in non-diabetic haemodialysis patients, similar risk factors for diabetic haemodialysis patients are not known. We compared factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification between haemodialysis patients with and without diabetes.; Methods: We examined 421 patients on maintenance haemodialysis. There were 89 patients with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (53 men and 36 women, 62+/-10 years old) and 332 patients without diabetes (192 men and 140 women, 59+/-13 years old). Hand roentgenography was carried out, and visible vascular calcification of the hand arteries was evaluated.; Results: There were 42 diabetic patients and 45 non-diabetic patients with vascular calcification. The prevalence of vascular calcification in diabetic patients (47.1%) was higher than in non-diabetic patients (13.6%) ( p<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression, the main factors affecting vascular calcification in non-diabetic patients were advanced age, longer duration of haemodialysis, increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower predialysis diastolic pressure. In diabetic patients, predictors for vascular calcification were higher values of HbA(1C) and longer duration of haemodialysis. In diabetic patients, a 1% increase in HbA(1C) increased the risk of calcification by 2.1-fold (95% CI 1.282-3.575, p=0.0029).; Conclusion/interpretation: We have shown that poor glycaemic control, rather than calcium and phosphate concentrations, is a predictor of peripheral vascular calcification in diabetic patients on haemodialysis. This study emphasizes that glycaemic control remains critical even in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease.;

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the combined effects of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes on the extent and developmental pattern of coronary artery disease (CAD).; Methods: A total of 3,017 self-referred asymptomatic individuals without known CAD who underwent 64-channel dual-source coronary computed tomography angiography between 2006 and 2010 were enrolled. The patients were divided into six groups based on their diabetes status (nondiabetic or diabetic) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (eGFR > 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, normal renal function; eGFR 60-89, mild CKD; or eGFR 30-59, moderate CKD). We compared the coronary artery calcium score (CACS), segment stenosis score (SSS), and ≥50% obstructive CAD among the groups.; Results: In nondiabetics, whereas SSS and ≥50% obstructive CAD were not different as renal function deteriorated, after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, CACS showed a unique developmental pattern: no CACS increase until mild CKD, but abrupt increase from the stage of moderate CKD (moderate vs. normal renal function, adjusted OR 5.118, 95% CI 1.293-20.262, p = 0.020). In diabetics, patients from the stage of mild CKD were more likely to have ≥50% obstructive CAD (p = 0.004), higher CACS (p = 0.020), and SSS (p = 0.001) in multivariable analysis.; Conclusions: The presence of CKD did not have a significant impact on the development of coronary atherosclerosis, but affected the progression of coronary calcification more markedly from the stage of moderate CKD in nondiabetics. However, in diabetics, the deterioration of renal function was significantly associated with the development of coronary atherosclerosis and calcification from the stage of mild CKD.; © 2018 S.

AB  - Purpose: To determine whether breast arterial calcifications (BAC) seen on mammography correlates with coronary artery calcium score on coronary CT as it may serve as a potential marker for increased risk of developing symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).; Materials and Methods: Retrospective review of the imaging database at our institution identified 145 female patients who underwent coronary CT within a year of screening or diagnostic mammography. The coronary calcium score on CT was calculated by multiplying area of calcification by weighted value assigned to its highest Hounsfield unit and summed for all lesions and expressed as Agaston score. Calculated scores were risk stratified for developing CAD as follows: 0-no risk; 1-10-minimal; 11-100-mild; 101-400-moderate; >400-high risk. Percentile distribution of calcium score adjusted by age, gender and race was calculated based on results of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), which excluded patient with diabetes and chronic renal disease. The mammograms were reviewed by MQSA-certified breast radiologists who were blinded to patients' coronary calcium scores. Mammograms were interpreted for presence or absence of BAC. The calcium scores and corresponding percentiles were correlated with BAC on mammography. Cardiac risk factors such as, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history of CAD and smoking, were recorded for each patient.; Results: BAC correlated with coronary calcium score of >11 (p=0.0001), corresponding to mild or greater risk of developing CAD. Specifically, coronary calcium score of >11 was seen in 68% (25/37) of patients with BAC and 31% (34/108) of patients without BAC. Accounting for race, gender and age, presence of BAC showed statistically significant correlation with percentile scores of >25. Namely, 70.4% (19/27) of patients with BAC vs. 44.6% (41/92) of patient without BAC showed percentile score of >25 for developing CAD. Statistically significant association was observed of BAC with diabetes (p=0.01) and chronic renal disease (p=0.005). BAC showed no significant associated with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking and family history of CAD.; Conclusion: BAC does predict coronary artery calcium score of >11, which indicates mild or greater risk of developing CAD. In addition, statistically significant correlation exists between BAC and cardiac risk factors, namely diabetes and chronic renal disease. Our study suggests that BAC on mammography can be utilized as a potential marker for increased risk of developing CAD.; Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) and arterial stiffness (AS) are major contributors to cardiovascular disease, and in chronic kidney disease, VC and AS are correlated. Disorders of calcium and phosphate metabolism contribute to the progression of VC and to increases in AS. The efficacy of cinacalcet (CIN) in reducing AS in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has not been determined. The present study enrolled 19 CAPD patients (12 women, 7 men; mean age: 62.2 +/- 3.6 years) with serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) greater than 500 ng/dL (mean value: 675 +/- 106 ng/dL) in whom daily oral treatment with CIN 25 mg was started. If administration of CIN for 3 months failed to reduce the level of iPTH to less than 300 ng/dL, the dose of CIN was increased to 50 mg daily. Before the start of CIN and at 3 years after the start of CIN, pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined. In 11 patients, levels of iPTH were reduced to less than 300 ng/dL; levels in the rest of the patients remained high. We observed no significant differences in PWV before CIN and at 3 years after CIN start (1856 +/- 198 cm/s vs. 1726 +/- 187 cm/s). Multivariate regression analysis of PWV demonstrated that both systolic blood pressure and changes in serum levels of phosphate contributed to decreases in PWV In patients receiving CAPD, VC and AS might be the result of higher systolic blood pressure and increased serum levels of phosphate.;

AB  - Calcium-phosphate disorders and vascular calcification are highly prevalent in patients with diabetes mellitus and nephropathy. The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence and advancement of vascular calcification in patients with end-stage diabetic nephropathy on peritoneal dialysis and diabetic patients with chronic renal disease stages 2-4. The study group included 31 patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy divided into 2 groups: 12 patients (aged 50-74 years: mean 58.6+/-8.8) undergoing peritoneal dialysis and 19 patients (aged 46-82 years; mean 65.8+/-9.7) with chronic kidney disease stages 2-4 (GFR range 24-78 ml/min/1.73 m2). Coronary artery calcification score, was assessed using multi-slice computed tomography. Coronary artery calcification score did not differ significantly between groups (CaSc values 1085.2 vs 452.4 AgU; NS). The patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis showed significantly higher levels of parathyroid hormone (658.2 vs. 74.3 pg/ml; p=0.001), fibrinogen (5.82 vs. 3.89 g/l; p<0.0001) and alkaline phosphatase (330.9 vs. 168.0 U/l; p=0.001). Despite more advanced abnormalities in calcium-phosphate balance parameters and more active inflammation in peritoneal dialysis subjects we failed to demonstrate any statistically significant difference in coronary artery calcification score between patients with diabetic nephropathy on peritoneal dialysis and those with chronic kidney disease stages 2-4.;

AB  - Hemodialfiltration (HDF) has been reported to reduce the frequency of intradialytic hypotension compared with hemodialysis (HD). We wished to determine whether HDF resulted in improvement of arterial stiffness compared with HD. We reviewed peripheral blood pressure and pulse wave velocity measurements in a cross-sectional analysis of stable HDF and HD outpatients. One hundred forty-one HDF patients were matched to 148 HD patients in terms of age, sex, prevalence of diabetes, peripheral blood pressure, and body mass. Pulse wave velocity was not different between the HD and HDF cohorts (median 9.1 [8.0-10.7] m/s vs. 9.7 [8.5-11.6] m/s). Similarly, there were no differences in central aortic pressure (149.2 ± 30.9 mmHg vs. 151.9 ± 35.2 mmHg), or aortic (39 [25.1-51.2]% vs. 38.6 [25.8-51.4]%) and brachial (3.8 [-24.3 to 26.9]% vs. 3 [-22.4 to 27.1]%) augmentation indices, respectively. Pulse wave velocity did not differ between adult patients treated by HD and HDF, and similarly, there were no differences in central aortic pressure, aortic or brachial augmentation indices, and cardiac diastolic perfusion. Our study suggests that HDF does not appear to offer any benefit over HD in terms of vascular stiffness.; © 2013 International Society for Hemodialysis.

AB  - Background: In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery calcification (CAC) and inflammation contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins do not improve survival in patients with ESRD, and their effect on vascular calcification is unclear. We explored associations between CAC, inflammatory biomarkers, statins and mortality in ESRD.; Materials and Methods: In 240 patients with ESRD (63% males; median age 56 years) from cohorts including 86 recipients of living donor kidney transplant (LD-Rtx), 96 incident dialysis patients and 58 prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients, associations of CAC score (Agatston Units, AUs), interleukin-6 (IL-6) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), use of statins and all-cause mortality were analysed. Cardiac CT was repeated in 35 patients after 1·5 years of renal replacement therapy. In vitro, human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) were used to measure vitamin K metabolism.; Results: Among 240 patients, 129 (53%) had a CAC score > 100 AUs. Multivariate analysis revealed that independent predictors of 1-SD higher CAC score were age, male gender, diabetes and use of statins. The association between CAC score and mortality remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, use of statins, protein-energy wasting and inflammation. Repeated CAC imaging in 35 patients showed that statin therapy was associated with greater progression of CAC. In vitro synthesis of menaquinone-4 by hVSMCs was significantly impaired by statins.; Conclusion: Elevated CAC score is a mortality risk factor in ESRD independent of inflammation. Future studies should resolve if statins promote vascular calcification and inhibition of vitamin K synthesis in the uremic milieu.; © 2016 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

AB  - Pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been reported in hemodialysis (HD) patients, but data regarding its incidence and mechanisms are scarce. The aims of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of unexplained PH in long-term HD patients, and to examine some possible etiologic factors for its occurrence. The prevalence of PH was estimated by Doppler echocardiography in a cohort of 86 stable patients on HD via arteriovenous access for more than 12 months. All the patients underwent full clinical evaluation, chest radiography, and a standard 12-lead echocardiograph. Laboratory investigation included a mean of 12 months (serum calcium, phosphorus, parathormone (PTH), alkaline phosphatase, lipids, and hemoglobin). Pulmonary hypertension was defined as pulmonary artery systolic pressure >35 mmHg as determined by Doppler echocardiography using the modified Bernoulli equation. Pulmonary hypertension was detected in 23 patients (26.74%). Of those with PH, left ventricular hypertrophy was seen in 13 patients (56.52%), and valvular calcifications in 6 patients (26.08%). There were no significant differences between both groups with regard to age, sex, duration of dialysis, shunt location, and all the biological parameters of the study. The presence of PH was not related to the level of PTH, or the severity of other metabolic abnormalities. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of PH among patients with ESRD receiving long-term HD via surgical arteriovenous access. The role of the vascular access, anemia, or secondary hyperparathyroidism as the etiology of PH in HD patients did not hold in this study.;

AB  - Aim: Vascular access (VA) dysfunction limits hemodialysis delivery, which increases morbidity and mortality. The most com mon cause of VA failure is thrombosis, due to flow limiting stenosis resulting from neointimal hyperplasia. This occurs not only due to hemodynamic factors but also by systemic ones related to vascular atherosclerosis, inflammation and calcification, which has developed a simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) predictor of vascular calcification and arterial stiffness. The NKF-K/DOQ recommends several diagnostic procedures for VA surveillance. Blood access flow (Qa) has predictive power for the detection of stenosis. Our aim was to evaluate the role of systemic factors, especially SCVS, on Qa.; Material and Methods: Transversal study in 50 patients. Qa value was obtained with Blood Temperature Monitor and Doppler method. Pearson coefficient evaluated correlation between them. Clinical, lab and radiological variables were recorded and non-parametric tests evaluated how both Qa varied with them.; Results: Pearson's corelation between DU-Qa and TD-Qa was 0.851 (p-value <0.001). DU-Qa varied significantly with age (p = 0.012), VA type (p = 0.021), SCVS (p = 0.030), intra-access arterial pressure (p = 0.015) and time on dialysis (p = 0.002). BTM-Qa varied significantly with diabetes status (p = 0.027), age (p = 0.017), first VA status (p = 0.036), intra-access arterial pressure (p = 0.028) and dialysis time (p = 0.001). Nevertheless, gender, hypertensive status and analitical parameters did not change the flow values.; Conclusion: Higher SVCS was associated only with lower DU-Qas, giving this method an advantage towards the indirect one. Additionally, a simple method like SVCS may be used to guide new surveillance recommendations accordingly to risk stratification.;

AB  - Pediatric kidney transplant recipients have a higher rate of coronary artery disease (CAD) as adults. The angiogenesis inhibitor, endostatin, has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis. Endostatin levels will vary between adult patients who received a kidney transplant as a child. We conducted a study in young adult patients who had undergone pediatric kidney (n = 12) or liver transplantation (n = 8). Coronary arterial calcification was measured using electron beam CT. Values were compared with age-matched control subjects from an epidemiologic database. Serum endostatin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Risk factors for atherosclerosis were assessed. Kidney transplant recipients had a higher rate of CAD compared with liver transplant recipients (33 vs 0%, P = 0.03). Mean (± standard error of mean) serum endostatin levels were higher in kidney transplant recipients compared with liver transplant recipients (26 ± 7 vs 14 ± 3 ng/mL, P = 0.04) and control subjects (26 ± 7 vs 11 ± 1 ng/mL, P = 0.01). Pediatric kidney transplantation is associated with a higher rate of adult-onset CAD compared with liver transplantation. Endostatin levels were greater in kidney transplant recipients compared with liver transplant recipients and healthy control subjects. Endostatin may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis after kidney transplantation and may serve as a biomarker for atherosclerotic disease.;

AB  - Bisphosphonates appear to regulate mineralization in both bone and vasculature. Degenerative aortic stenosis (AS) is thought to be due to vascular calcification. We studied the effect of bisphosphonates on the progression of degenerative AS. A retrospective study was performed on patients >70 years, who had transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) >1 year apart and an initial aortic valve area (AVA) of 0.6-2.0 cm². Patients were excluded if they had an ejection fraction <40%, other significant valvular or congenital heart disease, end-stage renal disease or heart transplant. The cohort was divided depending on the use of bisphosphonates. Data were obtained by review of the TTE reports. AVA, peak and mean aortic valve gradient (AVG), and the change between the studies were calculated. Of 4,270 patients screened for AS, 76 patients fit study criteria with 8 in the bisphosphonate group and 68 in the nonbisphosphonate group. The period between the TTEs was 23 ± 5 months in both the groups. AVA in the nonbisphosphonate group worsened by 0.2 cm² and in the bisphosphonate group it improved by 0.1 cm² (P = 0.001 vs. nonbisphosphonate). The changes in peak and mean AVG between groups and compared to baseline were not significant. Bisphosphonates show promise for slowing the progression of degenerative AS.; © 2010, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oral cholecalciferol treatment on vascular calcification, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and other cardiac functions in dialysis patients.; Design and Methods: A six-month course of oral cholecalciferol treatment was recommended to dialysis patients with vitamin D insufficiency. While 26 patients were given cholecalciferol treatment, 17 patients who could not tolerate to therapy received standard therapy. Initial biochemical parameters were measured, and they were measured again after 6 months of treatment. Echocardiographic measurements were also performed, and the vascular calcification score (VCS) was calculated at baseline and at the 6th month.; Results: The cholecalciferol replacement group showed no significant change in LVMI and VCS values (p > 0.05). However, while LVMI was similar between groups at initial evaluation, it was lower in the cholecalciferol group at the 6th month when compared to the standard treatment group (141.8 ± 40.2 g/m(2) vs. 166.3 ± 31.4 g/m(2); p = 0.04). Likewise, left ventricular diastolic diameters (48.8 ± 5.1 mm vs. 47.5 ± 4.6 mm; p = 0.023) and left atrial diameters (41.2 ± 8.9 mm vs. 38.9 ± 8.1 mm; p = 0.006) decreased in the cholecalciferol group. Additionally, significant increases were observed in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and albumin levels, with a significant decrease in serum C-reactive protein levels.; Conclusion: A lesser increase in left ventricular mass and better diastolic functions was observed in dialysis patients after 6 months of cholecalciferol treatment.;

AB  - Background: Disorders of mineral metabolism, including secondary hyperparathyroidism, are thought to contribute to extraskeletal (including vascular) calcification among patients with chronic kidney disease. It has been hypothesized that treatment with the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet might reduce the risk of death or nonfatal cardiovascular events in such patients.; Methods: In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 3883 patients with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (median level of intact parathyroid hormone, 693 pg per milliliter [10th to 90th percentile, 363 to 1694]) who were undergoing hemodialysis to receive either cinacalcet or placebo. All patients were eligible to receive conventional therapy, including phosphate binders, vitamin D sterols, or both. The patients were followed for up to 64 months. The primary composite end point was the time until death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or a peripheral vascular event. The primary analysis was performed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle.; Results: The median duration of study-drug exposure was 21.2 months in the cinacalcet group, versus 17.5 months in the placebo group. The primary composite end point was reached in 938 of 1948 patients (48.2%) in the cinacalcet group and 952 of 1935 patients (49.2%) in the placebo group (relative hazard in the cinacalcet group vs. the placebo group, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.02; P=0.11). Hypocalcemia and gastrointestinal adverse events were significantly more frequent in patients receiving cinacalcet.; Conclusions: In an unadjusted intention-to-treat analysis, cinacalcet did not significantly reduce the risk of death or major cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who were undergoing dialysis.

AB  - Purpose: Patients with a surgically reduced renal mass are at increased risk for progressive renal failure, which often requires renal replacement therapy or kidney transplantation. We investigated the effects of simvastatin supplementation on uremia enhanced atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in apoE(-/-) (apolipoprotein E deficient) mice (Charles Rivers Laboratories, Wilmington, Massachusetts) with or without superimposed chronic kidney disease.; Materials and Methods: The mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups, including 2 groups with normal renal function (simvastatin vs control in 13 mice) and the other 2 with surgically created chronic kidney disease (simvastatin vs control in 18). Simvastatin (100 mg/kg) was administered by daily oral gavage for 4 weeks.; Results: Simvastatin treatment did not prevent uremia accelerated atherosclerosis in chronic kidney disease apoE(-/-) mice, nor did it retard atherosclerosis progression in control nonchronic kidney disease mice. However, aortic plaques in simvastatin treated chronic kidney disease mice showed significantly less calcification than those in controls with chronic kidney disease (p <0.03). In addition, the increase of aortic nitrotyrosine staining in mice with chronic kidney disease was prevented by simvastatin treatment (p <0.02). Serum total cholesterol was increased to a similar extent in the 2 chronic kidney disease groups compared with that in the nonchronic kidney disease groups. The beneficial effect of simvastatin on uremia enhanced vascular calcification in apoE(-/-) mice with chronic kidney disease was observed despite the absence of changes in uremia accelerated atherosclerosis progression, serum total cholesterol levels or osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase expression.; Conclusions: Our observation opens the possibility of a cholesterol independent action of statins on vascular calcification via a decrease in oxidative stress.;

AB  - Introduction: Observational studies have shown that high dietary intake of vitamin K2 is associated with reduced risk of coronary vascular disease and vascular calcification.; Objectives: We assessed the effect of vitamin K2 substitution on the progression of atherosclerosis and calcification in nondialyzed patients with CKD stages 3-5.; Patients and Methods: The study included 42 nondialyzed patients with CKD. The following measurements were taken at baseline and after 270 ±12 days of supplementation with vitamin K2 at a dose of 90 μg (menaquinone, MK-7) together with 10 μg of cholecalciferol (K+D group) or 10 μg of cholecalciferol (group D): common carotid intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), coronary artery calcification score (CACS), basic biochemical parameters, lipids, and calcification modulators: matrix Gla protein (MGP), desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), fetuin A, osteocalcin (OC), and fibroblast growth factor 23.; Results: The increase of CCA-IMT was significantly lower in the K+D group compared with the D group: from 0.95 ±0.2 mm to 1.01 ±0.3, P = 0.003 vs from 1.02 ±0.2 mm to 1.16 ±0.3, P = 0.003 (ΔCCA-IMT, 0.06 ±0.08 vs 0.136 ±0.05 mm, P = 0.005, respectively). The increase in CACS was slightly lower in the K+D group than in the D group (ΔCACS, 58.1 ±106.5 AU vs 74.4 ±127.1 AU, P = 0.7). In the K+D group, a significant decrease in the level of dp-ucMGP and total OC was observed.; Conclusions: A 270-day course of vitamin K2 administration in patients with CKD stages 3-5 may reduce the progression of atherosclerosis, but does not significantly affect the progression of calcification. Vitamin K2 significantly changes the levels of calcification promoters and inhibitors: dp-ucMGP, OC, and OPG.;

AB  - Background/aims: We assessed changes in hemodynamic and arterial stiffness parameters following reductions of dialysate calcium concentrations in patients undergoing hemodialysis.; Methods: In this prospective study, 20 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (10 females, 10 males) with dialysate calcium concentrations of 1.75 mmol/L were enrolled. At the start of the study, the dialysate calcium level was lowered to 1.50 mmol/L. Serial changes in biochemical, hemodynamic, and arterial stiffness parameters, including pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx), were assessed every 2 months for 6 months. We also examined changes in the calcification-inhibitory protein, serum fetuin-A.; Results: During the 6-month study period, serum total calcium and ionized calcium decreased consistently (9.5 ± 1.0 to 9.0 ± 0.7, p = 0.002 vs. 1.3 ± 0.1 to 1.1 ± 0.1, p = 0.035). Although no apparent changes in blood pressure were observed, heart-femoral PWW (hf-PWV) and AIx showed significant improvement (p = 0.012, 0.043, respectively). Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a significant effect of lowering dialysate calcium on hf-PWV (F = 4.58, p = 0.004) and AIx (F = 2.55, p = 0.049). Accompanying the change in serum calcium, serum fetuin-A levels significantly increased (95.8 ± 45.8 pmol/mL at baseline to 124.9 ± 82.2 pmol/mL at 6 months, p = 0.043).; Conclusions: Lowering dialysate calcium concentration significantly improved arterial stiffness parameters, which may have been associated with upregulation of serum fetuin-A.;

AB  - Background/aim: Vascular calcification is thought to be associated with a high cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with end-stage renal disease. Control of hyperphosphataemia is important for the treatment of the vascular calcification. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sevelamer hydrochloride on the progression of aortic calcification in haemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods: 42 HD patients were studied in this study and divided into two groups (sevelamer vs. calcium). Sevelamer was added and titrated up to achieve serum P control for 6 months. The estimations of aortic calcification index (ACI) by abdominal computed tomography scans were performed twice in each patient. We compared the changes in serum calcium, phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, and lipids in two groups.; Results: Serum phosphorus levels decreased significantly from 6.7 +/- 0.7 to 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/dl with no changes in serum intact parathyroid hormone levels in the sevelamer group (p < 0.01), and increased from 6.5 +/- 1.0 to 6.7 +/- 1.1 mg/dl in the calcium group (p < 0.05). Serum calcium levels did not change in the sevelamer group and calcium group. The serum levels of total cholesterol decreased significantly from 158.5 +/- 20.7 to 146.2 +/- 24.1 mg/dl (p = 0.024) and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level from 65.3 +/- 14.4 to 54.7 +/- 11.6 mg/dl (p = 0.014) in the sevelamer group. Serum C-reactive protein decreased significantly from 0.14 +/- 0.13 to 0.08 +/- 0.11 mg/dl in the sevelamer group (p = 0.038) and significantly increased (0.18 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.12 mg/dl) in the calcium group (p = 0.042). The mean changes in ACI (DeltaACI) were 3.6 +/- 1.5% in the sevelamer group and 8.2 +/- 3.1% in the calcium group.; Conclusions: Sevelamer allows a better serum phosphorus control compared with calcium-based phosphate binder and suppresses the progression of aortic calcification in HD patients.; Copyright  2008 S.

AB  - Background and Aims: Chronic kidney disease mineral- and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) has been studied more often in dialysis than in predialysis CKD patients. The association between efficacy of hyperphosphatemia control and chronic renal failure (CRF) progression, prevalence of bone disease and cardiovascular calcification was the objective of the present investigation.; Material and Methods: 42 patients with CKD in Stage 5, regularly monitored for 5 years, were divided into Group 1 of 20 patients with normal serum phosphate (sPO4) levels and Group 2 of 22 patients with hyperphosphatemia registered at the majority of checks. Serum urea, creatinine, calcium (sCa) and sPO4 levels were regularly determined in the retrospective 5-year period. At the end of this period iPTH, bone alkaline phosphatase-BAP and inflammation markers (CRP, fetuin-A) were measured, valvular and arterial calcifications were detected by B mode echocardiogram and soft-tissue native radiograms of the pelvis and the wrist.; Results: Progression of CRF (1/sCr over time) was faster in Group 2 than in Group 1 (b = -0.0577 vs. -0.0288, p = 0.003) during the study period. Average BAP and iPTH values were similar in both groups and 23/42 patients had PTH > 300 pg/ml. Arterial and valvular calcifications were found in 5/23 patients from Group 1 and 14/22 patients from Group 2 (p = 0.011). Linear regression analysis revealed sPO4 as a predictor for total calcification number, inflammatory diseases as a predictor for valvular calcifications, while sPO4 and iPTH were predictors for arterial calcifications.; Conclusions: More than half the patients with Stage 5 CKD not yet on dialysis exhibited elevated PTH. Faster CRF progression and frequent arterial and valvular calcifications were seen in patients with poor phosphate control and sPO4 was selected as an independent predictor of total calcification score.;

AB  - Background/aim: Electron-beam computerized tomography (EBCT) is able to noninvasively quantify coronary artery calcification (CAC). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients frequently have CAC, and clinicians are puzzled regarding the clinical significance of this finding and the diagnostic accuracy of coronary EBCT in CKD. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation in CKD patients between CAC measured by EBCT and 50% stenosis determined by coronary angiography (CA), the gold standard to identify atherosclerotic lesions.; Method: We recruited 37 patients with CKD from a single institution and compared their coronary EBCT and CA results using standard statistical analysis.; Results: Patients with at least one vessel with > or = 50% stenosis by CA had higher mean CAC scores [2,407.9 +/- (SD) 3,165.3 vs. 227 +/- 443.4; p < 0.001] and higher median CAC scores (1,052 vs. 25.8; p < 0.001) as compared with those having no stenosis > or = 50%. The sensitivity was 85.7%, and the specificity 82.6% using 50% stenosis as the definition for coronary artery disease and using a CAC score of 400 as a cutoff value for the EBCT results. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.84. The diagnostic accuracy (proportion of correct results) was 83.8%. The negative predictive value was 90.5%. The receiver operating characteristic curve suggests that the optimal cutoff value for CAC scores in our cohort is 315.9, increasing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to 0.91. The total coronary artery stenosis was significantly associated with the CAC score (p = 0.01).; Conclusions: EBCT has a very good predictive value for obstructive coronary artery disease. EBCT could be used as a screening tool in CKD patients with a low-to-intermediate risk for coronary artery disease.; 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - We studied the correlations between circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level and radial artery calcification (RAC) assessed histologically and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT). Moreover, we studied the relationship between OPG levels and all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality during a 5-year observation period. The study comprised 59 CKD patients (36 hemodialyzed (HD), 23 predialysis). The biochemical parameters included: creatinine, calcium, phosphate, intact parathormone, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor receptor II (TNFRII), transforming growth factor-β, hepatocyte growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 23, osteonectin (ON), osteopontin, osteoprotegerin, and osteocalcin. CCA-IMT and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques was assessed by ultrasound. Fragments of radial artery obtained during creation of HD access were prepared for microscopy and stained for calcifications with alizarin red. RAC was detected in 34 patients (58%). In multiple regression adjusted for dialysis status, TNFRII, ON and Framingham risk score (FRS) were identified as the independent predictors of OPG. Serum OPG above the median value of 7.55 pmol/L significantly predicted the presence of RAC in simple logistic regression (OR 5.33; 95%CI 1.39-20.4; P = 0.012) and in multiple logistic regression adjusted for FRS, dialysis status and CCA-IMT values (OR 6.56; 95%CI 1.06-40.6; P = 0.036). OPG levels above the median were associated with higher CCA-IMT values (1.02 ± 0.10 vs. 0.86 ± 0.13; P < 0.001) and predicted the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in carotid artery (OR 14.4; 95%CI 2.84-72.9; P < 0.001), independently of FRS, dialysis status and RAC. In this study, elevated serum OPG levels correlated with higher CCA-IMT, the presence of atherosclerotic plaques and the severity of the RAC independently of each other. During follow-up, 25 patients (42%) died, including 21 due to CV causes. In multiple Cox regression, OPG above the median predicted overall survival independently of dialysis status, Framingham risk score, CCA-IMT above the median value, and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in CCA, but not independently of RAC. We postulate that circulating OPG may play a dual role as a marker for both medial arterial calcification and atherosclerosis, hence it seems to be a valuable tool for assessing CV risk in patients with CKD. OPG might be an early indicator of all-cause mortality in CKD patients with advanced medial arterial calcification.; © 2018 International Society for Apheresis, Japanese Society for Apheresis, and Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. The mechanisms of vascular damage are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to prospectively investigate the importance of novel mediators of vascular damage, in conjunction with vascular calcification (VC), on survival.; Methods: A total of 134 subjects [60 haemodialysis (HD), 28 peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 46 CKD stage 4] were studied. All survivors completed 40 months of follow-up. VC was measured using multi-slice spiral CT of the superficial femoral artery. Circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG), Fetuin-A and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured in addition to standard clinical biochemical analysis.; Results: After a 40-month follow-up, 31 patients had died (27 men and 4 women). Of 31 subjects, 31 had evidence of significant VC. The majority of deaths were in the HD group (48%), 36% were PD subjects and 16% were CKD subjects. The outcome of interest was survival at the end of follow-up. Multivariate logistical regression analysis revealed male gender [OR 8.06 (1.34-48.450) P = 0.02], OPG >25 pmol/L [OR 5.31(1.35-20.88) P = 0.02] and hypoalbuminaemia [OR 0.26 (0.12-0.56) P < 0.01], were associated with increased odds of death.; Conclusion: We have previously reported that VC and low albumin predict death in CKD stages 4 and 5 over a 2-year follow-up period. These data show that OPG, independent of CRP, is also associated with a negative outcome. The mechanisms remain to be elucidated; however, it is likely that they are associated with vascular damage through mechanisms in addition to VC.;

AB  - Background: Patients on hemodialysis (HD) frequently experience cardiovascular events associated with vascular calcification. We investigated the involvement of osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of vascular calcification, in the incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality among new HD patients.; Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of the association of serum OPG levels with morbidity and mortality in subjects who became new HD patients between June 2000 and May 2006.; Results: A total of 99 patients (age 58.9 +/- 14.6 years, 65 male, 34 female) were prospectively followed up for 41.5 +/- 20.2 months. During this period, 27 patients developed cardiovascular events and 12 died of causes related to cardiovascular disease. When divided into 2 groups according to OPG levels, the high OPG group showed a higher prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with the low OPG group. Cox's proportional hazards analysis associated the new onset of cardiovascular events with the high OPG group (HR 2.88, 95% CI 1.09-7.62, p = 0.033). Furthermore, the high OPG group at the start of HD was significantly associated with older age, male gender and a high aortic calcification index.; Conclusions: Elevated levels of serum OPG in new HD patients may predict subsequent cardiovascular events.; 2008 S.

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the present study, we investigated the potential involvement of endothelial microparticles (MPs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the generation of VC in CKD patients. The number of circulating EMPs is greater in patients with VC than without VC (307 ± 167 vs. 99 ± 75 EMPs/μl, P < 0.001). The percentage of EPCs is significantly lower in patient with VC than in patients without VC (0.14 ± 0.11% vs. 0.25 ± 0.18%, P = 0.002). The number of EPCs expressing osteocalcin (OCN) was higher in VC patients (349 ± 63 cells/100,000) than in non-VC patients (139 ± 75 cells/100,000, P < 0.01). In vitro, MPs obtained from CKD patients were able to induce OCN expression in EPCs from healthy donors; the increase in OCN expression was more accentuated if MPs were obtained from CKD patients with VC. MPs from CKD patients also induced OCN expression in vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. In CKD patients, the rise in endothelial MPs associated with a decrease in the number of EPCs, suggesting an imbalance in the processes of endothelial damage and repair in CKD patients, mainly those with VC. Our results suggest that EPCs, through OCN expression, may directly participate in the process of VC.; Copyright © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - Vascular calcification, prevalent in diabetes and chronic kidney disease, contributes to morbidity and mortality. To investigate the effect of receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) on vascular calcification in vivo, transgenic mice, where RANKL expression was targeted to vascular smooth muscle cells using the SM22α promoter (SM22α-Rankl ( tg )), were created. Sixteen-month-old male SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) mice had higher body weight and higher serum calcium levels but lower lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) compared with age- and gender-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. BMD of long bones, body fat (percent of weight) of the leg, and serum levels of phosphate and RANKL were not significantly different. No significant differences in these parameters were observed in female mice. Histological analysis did not reveal calcium deposits in the aortic roots of SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) mice. To analyze the osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization potentials of vascular cells, aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated and cultured. Results showed that SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) SMCs had higher baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity but not baseline matrix calcification. When induced by the PKA agonist forskolin, ALP activity was greater in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) than in WT SMCs. Real-time RT-qPCR revealed higher baseline expression of ALP and ankylosis genes but lower osteoprotegerin gene in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) SMCs. Matrix mineralization induced by inorganic phosphate or forskolin was greater in SM22α-Rankl ( tg ) than in WT SMCs. Treatment of these cells with the ALP inhibitor levamisole abolished forskolin-induced matrix mineralization but not inorganic phosphate-induced matrix mineralization. These findings suggest that RANKL overexpression in the vasculature may promote mineralization potential.;

AB  - Background/aims: Atherosclerosis, coronary artery calcification, diabetes mellitus, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy are the most commonly encountered risk factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is the true visceral fat depot of the heart. The relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and EAT was shown in healthy subjects and patients with high risk of CAD. To date, there is not enough data about EAT in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the EAT and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects.; Methods: Sixty ESRD patients (17 diabetic, 43 nondiabetic ESRD patients) and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. EAT and CACS were performed by a 64-slice multidetector computed tomography scanner.; Results: There were no differences in age, gender, body mass index, predialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, biochemical parameters including serum low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein between healthy subjects, diabetic, and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Total CACSs and EAT measurements were significantly higher in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. There was statistically significant relationship between EAT and CACS in ESRD patients (p < 0.0001, r = 0.48).; Conclusion: In conclusion, we found a significant increase in terms of EAT and CACS in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects.;

AB  - Objective: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is proposed as a cardiovascular risk marker in non-uremic subjects. However, little is known about its role in patients with higher cardiovascular risk profile such as chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between EAT and several cardiovascular surrogate markers (coronary artery calcification (CAC), arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.; Methods: A total of 191 prevalent hemodialysis patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. EAT and CAC scores (CACs) were determined by multi-slice computerized tomography, arterial stiffness by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) by B-mode doppler ultrasonography.; Results: Mean age was 59 ± 13 years and time on hemodialysis 75 ± 44 months. Twenty percent of the patients had diabetes. Mean EAT volume was 62.6 ± 26.8 cm(3)/m(2). Mean CA-IMT and PWV values increased across the EAT tertiles. EAT was correlated with age, female gender, body mass index, albumin and lipid parameters. Additionally, CA-IMT and PWV values were positively correlated with EAT. EAT volume was significantly higher in patients with CACs >10 compared to the patients with CACs ≤10. Despite the univariate associations between EAT and cardiovascular surrogate markers, only age, body mass index and total cholesterol levels were associated with EAT in adjusted models.; Conclusions: In prevalent hemodialysis patients, EAT is correlated with atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and the presence of CAC. However, this correlation is not independent of other risk factors.; Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In the general population, aortic arch calcification (AAC) is related to cardiovascular (CV) disease. Vascular calcifications are common findings in dialysis patients; therefore, we carried out a retrospective study evaluating which risk factors are associated to AAC in stable hemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods: Standard posterior-anterior chest radiographs, performed the day after the midweek HD session in 132 patients (mean age 65 +/- 12 yrs) who had been on renal replacement therapy (RRT) for 33 months (range 1-471), were analyzed. Cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) was also calculated.; Results: AAC was detected in 51% of patients. They were older (68 +/- 8 vs. 62 +/- 14 yrs; p = 0.003), were on RRT for longer (51 (range 2-471) vs. 22 (range 1-195) months; p = 0.0001), had greater CTR (54 (32-71) vs. 50% (40-65); p = 0.034) and higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (40 vs. 17%; p = 0.049), whilst body weight was lower (62 +/- 14 vs. 68 +/- 14 kg; p = 0.04) than those without AAC. On the contrary, sex, diabetes frequency, smoking habit, history of hypertension and hyperphosphatemia, cerebrovascular and ischemic heart disease (IHD), blood pressure (BP) and antihypertensive therapy, lipids, albumin, degree of anemia, calcium, phosphate and their product were no different between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio (OR) 1.069 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-1.11; p = 0.003), length of time on RRT (OR 1.02 95% CI 1.01-1.03; p = 0.0002), calcium-phosphate product (OR 1.03 95% CI 1.007-1.07; p = 0.016), systolic BP (OR 1.03 95% CI 1.005-1.06; p = 0.02) and PVD (OR 3.08 95% CI 1.17-8.06; p = 0.02) were independently associated to AAC.; Conclusions: We conclude that AAC is related to atherosclerosis and to renal failure-related CV risk factors. A careful evaluation of a frequently performed investigation is useful in CV disease risk stratification in HD patients.;

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis (HD) patients, especially with diabetes mellitus (DM) complications. No randomized studies have been published regarding the effect of lanthanum carbonate (LC) on VC progression in DM patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of lanthanum carbonate on the progression of VC in HD patients with type 2 DM. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing LC with calcium carbonate (CC) in 43 HD patients at a single dialysis center. Estimations of aortic calcification index (ACI) by abdominal computed tomography were performed twice for each patient (at baseline and 12 months). Forty-one patients completed the study (19 LC, 22 CC). When ACI at baseline was ≦0.48 (median of baseline ACI), median change in ACI (Δ%ACI) was 20.44 (11.50-36.80%) in the LC group, and 40.00 (33.30-92.60%) in the CC group (P = 0.026). On the other hand, when ACI at baseline was >0.48, the median change in ACI (Δ%ACI) was 6.42 (3.13-24.40%) in the LC group, and 8.08 (5.68-12.20%) in the CC group (P = 1.000). Serum markers of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), HbA1c, dose of vitamin D analogues, and side-effects of medications did not change in either group throughout the study except int-PTH increased in the LC group. This study indicated that administration of LC inhibited the progression of VC in patients receiving HD for type 2 DM, only in cases of slight VC compared with CC.; © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Additional to traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), recent evidence demonstrates that nontraditional risk factors such as high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), hyperhomocysteinemia and vascular calcification may cause progressive atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients.; Objective: We aim to determine the prevalence of atherosclerosis and assess the arterial stiffness and related risk factors.; Material and Method: Common carotid artery intima-media thicknesses (CIMT), atherosclerotic plaque occurrence were determined by B-mode ultrasonography in 105 hemodialysis patients (mean age, 53 +/- 15.5 years; mean dialysis duration 82 +/- 59.5 months). A history of clinically significant atherosclerotic vascular disease was elicited by patient questionnaire and verified by careful patient chart review and physical examination. Cardiovascular ankle index (CAVI) was use to assess arterial stiffness. Serum biochemical marker for traditional risk factors, hsCRP and homocysteine were measured by standard method.; Results: Atherosclerotic vascular disease (defined by a history of CVD or presence of atherosclerotic plaque) was present in 79% of patients. Compared to non-atherosclerotic group, the mean CIMT and serum hsCRP in atherosclerotic group was higher (1.9 +/- 0.8 mm vs. 0.8 +/- 0.6 mm, p < 0.001; 6.5 +/- 8.8 mg/L vs. 3.3 +/- 3.5 mg/L, p = 0.03, respectively), while other biochemical markers were not significantly different, as well as the percentage of abnormal CAVI (69% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.28). CAVI was positively correlated with maximum carotid intima-meida thickness (r = 0.44, p < 0.001). CAVI was also significantly greater in patients with carotid plaque (soft plaque (p < 0.05) and calcified plaque (p < 0.05)) compared with patients without carotid plaque.; Conclusion: A high prevalence of atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness was observed in hemodialysis patients. Carotid atherosclerosis is associated with an increased inflammatory marker (hsCRP). CAVI may be a useful index to assess arterial stiffness and associated with arterial intima-media thickness.;

AB  - Objective: Angiography remains a critical component for diagnostic imaging and therapeutic intervention in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The goal of this study was to compare angiography with corresponding intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging of the same vessels in patients with PAD.; Methods: From 2004 to 2008, 93 patients undergoing angiography for PAD were recruited in a prospective observational analysis. At the time of angiography, diseased lower extremities were interrogated using a 10-cm IVUS pullback with registration points. IVUS data were analyzed with radiofrequency techniques for vessel and lumen diameter, plaque volume, plaque composition, and cross-sectional area. Similarly, three vascular surgeons blinded to the IVUS data graded corresponding angiographic images according to vessel diameter, degree of stenosis, degree of calcification, and extent of eccentricity. Statistical analyses of matched IVUS images and angiograms were performed.; Results: The distribution of demographic and risk variables were typical for PAD: 54% male, 96% hypertension, 78% hyperlipidemia, 44% diabetic, 87% tobacco history, 65% coronary artery disease, and 10% end-stage renal disease. Symptoms precipitating the angiographic evaluation included claudication (53%), rest pain (18%), and tissue loss (29%). Angiographic and IVUS interpretation were similar for luminal diameters, but external vessel diameter was greater by IVUS imaging (7.0 +/- 0.7 vs 5.2 +/- 0.8 mm, P < .05). The two-dimensional diameter method resulted in a significant correlation for stenosis determination (r = 0.84); however, IVUS determination of vessel area stenosis was greater by 10% (95% confidence interval, 0.3%-21%, P < .05). IVUS imaging indicated that a higher proportion of plaques were concentric. Grading of calcification was moderate to severe in 40% by angiography but in only 7% by IVUS (P < .05).; Conclusions: In the evaluation of PAD, angiography and IVUS imaging provide similar luminal diameters and diameter-reducing stenosis measurements. Determination of overall vessel diameter and interpretation of plaque morphology by angiography are discordant from IVUS-derived data.;

AB  - Psoriasis patients are determined to have a high ratio of coronary artery calcification. Fetuin-A and osteoprotegerin are systemic calcification inhibitors and related to vascular calcification and cardiovascular mortality. In this study we investigated the relationship between fetuin-A and osteoprotegerin levels in psoriasis patients. The study included 40 healthy volunteers and 40 psoriasis patients. Venous blood were collected from healthy volunteers and psoriasis patients in order to search the fetuin-A and osteoprotegerin levels. Disease severity were grouped as mild, moderate and severe according to psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). The relationship between fetuin-A and osteoprotegerin levels and clinical features as sex, PASI and presence of psoriatic arthritis were analyzed. Fetuin-A levels in psoriasis patients were statistically lower than the control group (p < 0.001). In serum osteoprotegerin levels, no statistically significant difference was found in two groups (p > 0.05). Serum fetuin-A and osteoprotegerin level differences were not statistically significant between patients with psoriatic arthritis history and those without. When we grouped patients in respect of their sexes fetuin-A and osteoprotegerin levels of males and females were not significantly different (p > 0.05). No correlation was detected between the ages and PASI scores and the fetuin-A and osteoprotegerin levels of patients. As a result fetuin-A levels in psoriasis patients are found to be low but not related to disease severity. In the light of our results we concluded that fetuin-A may have a role in psoriasis pathogenesis and may contribute to the calcification process developed in psoriasis.;

AB  - Background: Haemodialysis (HD) patients are at increased risk of the development of arterial intimal (AIC) and medial calcification (AMC). The aim of our study was to analyze the association between the pre-defined potential risk factors and the status of various arterial calcifications in our HD patients.; Methods: In a cross-sectional study of 150 patients (91 male, mean age 54.55 +/- 12.46 yrs, HD duration 104.77 +/- 68.02 mths) we first determined the presence of AIC and AMC using plain radiography of the pelvis. We then compared the percentages of different radiogram findings in patients stratified according to various cut-off levels or the codes of each clinical and biochemical parameter (mean value of one year laboratory data recorded in the files).; Results: We determined arterial calcifications in 77.3% of our patients (AIC in 45.3%, AMC in 32%). The significantly higher frequencies of arterial calcifications of both groups (AIC and/or AMC) and isolated AIC presence were found in patients older than 55 at inclusion and 45 at the start of treatment with HD, with a serum C-reactive protein (CRP) > 4.5 mg/L, predominantly of male gender with diabetes. The patients with a significantly higher occurrence of arterial calcifications had lower percentages of total serum calcium (Ca) levels but within the K/DOQI guideline recommendations. Also, we found a significantly higher proportion of isolated AIC presence in the group of patients with corrected total serum Ca levels > 2.35 mmol/L and serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels out of the range proposed by K/DOQI guidelines. In parallel, a significantly higher percentage of absence of arterial calcifications (ACA) was obtained in the patients with corrected total serum Ca levels < 2.35 mmol/L, body mass index (BMI) < 23 kg/m(2), mean pulse pressure < 60 mmHg, blood leucocytes < 6.5 x 10(9)L and serum triglycerides < 1.8 mmol/L. Finally, we found a significantly higher presence of isolated AMC in patients with mean Kt/V < 1.3 (poor dialysis adequacy), serum triglycerides > 1.8 mmol/L and outside K/DOQI guideline achievements for corrected total serum Ca. In the 12 month period data analyzed, there were no significant differences in other risk factors such as the dose of prescribed calcium carbonate and vitamin D3, serum levels of albumin, cholesterol, phosphate (P) and Ca x P product.; Conclusions: AIC and AMC were frequently present in our HD population. Age, gender, BMI, diabetes, pulse pressure, dialysis adequacy, serum CRP, triglycerides, Ca and iPTH, as well as blood leucocyte levels were associated with the occurrence of arterial calcifications in our HD patients.;

AB  - Background: Serum fetuin-A has been shown to be a strong risk marker for myocardial infarction/stroke in the general population, and has been associated with vascular calcifications in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although these issues are worthy of being addressed in children and adolescents as well, adequate age- and gender-related reference values are missing.; Method: Within a healthy paediatric population (n = 246), fetuin-A serum concentrations were determined (ELISA kit; Epitope Diagnostics, San Diego, CA, USA) essentially as described by the manufacturer. At the same time, serum protein and serum albumin were measured with established procedures (Beckman Coulter Inc., Krefeld, Germany). Subjects were stratified according to age (<1 yr [n = 25], > or =1 and <6 yr [n = 65], > or =6 and <12 yr [n = 66], > or =12 yr and <16 [n = 45] and > or =16 yr [n = 45]), and both genders were equally distributed within each age cohort.; Results: Within each age cohort, fetuin-A serum concentrations were normally distributed, independent of age and gender and the respective reference range (mean +/- 1.96 SD) is 0.22-0.70 g/L (0.46 +/- 0.24 g/L).; Conclusion: Fetuin-A serum concentrations are independent of age and gender in a healthy paediatric population and are well comparable with those determined in adults with the same assay.;

AB  - Objectives: Serum Fetuin A has been identified as an inhibitor of ectopic calcification. It is reduced in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and it has been proposed as a potential link between CKD and the higher prevalence of arterial calcification observed in these patients. During aging both the stiffening of arterial wall due to calcification and a decline in kidney function are frequent. The aim of the study is to investigate if Fetuin A serum levels are associated with aging and with AHSG T256S polymorphism. Moreover, we aim at investigate whether serum Fetuin A is correlated to kidney function in this setting of senescence.; Design and Methods: 256 health long-lived subjects (age 92 [81-100]) were recruited for the study. Serum Fetuin A was evaluated by ELISA, Cystatin C by immune-nephelometry. AHSG T256S was determinated by PCR-RFLP.; Results: Serum Fetuin A shows a significant correlation with age (r=0.20; P=0.0048). AHSG TS and SS genotypes are associated to lower levels of serum protein (0.27 [0.19-0.29] g/L vs 0.42 [0.32-0.49] g/L; P<0.027 and 0.34 [0.25-0.41] g/L vs 0.42 [0.32-0.49] g/L; P<0.001, respectively). No significant correlation between Fetuin A and Cystatin C was observed.; Conclusions: Serum Fetuin A increases with age in elder individuals and subjects with the TS or SS AHSG polymorphism have lower levels of the circulating protein. No correlation with kidney function decline was observed. Other mechanisms should be investigated to explain the increase of Fetuin A with age.; Copyright © 2012 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Disordered mineral metabolism is implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is the main regulator of phosphate metabolism. In this prospective study, we aimed to investigate the association of serum FGF-23 with progression of coronary artery calcification in HD patients.; Methods: Seventy-four HD patients (36 male/38 female, mean age: 52 ± 14 years) were included. Serum FGF-23 levels were measured by ELISA. Coronary artery calcification score (CACS) was measured twice with one year interval. Patients were grouped as progressive (PG) (36 patients-48%) and non-progressive (NPG).; Results: Age, serum phosphorus, baseline and first year CACS were found to be significantly higher in the PG compared to NPG group. Serum FGF-23 levels were significantly higher in PG [155 (80-468) vs 147 (82-234), p = 0.04]. Patients were divided into two groups according to baseline CACS (low group, CACS ≤ 30; high group, CACS > 30). Serum FGF-23 levels were significantly correlated with the progression of CACS (ΔCACS) in the low baseline CACS group (r = 0.51, p = 0.006), but this association was not found in high baseline CACS group (r = 0.11, p = 0.44). In logistic regression analysis for predicting the PG patients; serum FGF-23, phosphorus levels and baseline CACS were retained as significant factors in the model.; Conclusions: Serum FGF-23 was found to be related to progression of CACS independent of serum phosphorus levels. FGF-23 may play a major role in the progression of vascular calcification especially at the early stages of calcification process in HD patients.;

AB  - Purpose: High fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels are associated with mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between plasma FGF-23 levels and coronary artery calcification and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) in hemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods: In this cross-sectional study, plasma intact FGF-23 levels were measured in 229 patients who underwent coronary artery calcification scores (CACs) determined by multi-slice computerized tomography and CA-IMT assessed by using high-resolution color Doppler ultrasonography.; Results: Median FGF-23 was 53.5 pg/ml (IQR 30.8-249.5). Median CACs was 98 (IQR 0-531), and the frequency of patients with severe calcification (CACs > 400) was 28.8%; 27.5% of cases had no calcification. Mean CA-IMT was 0.78 ± 0.20 mm, and the presence of carotid plaques was 51% with a mean length 2.1 mm. FGF-23 level was positively correlated with serum calcium (r = 0.337, p < 0.001), phosphate (r = 0.397, p < 0.001) and CACs (r = 0.218, p = 0.001). Neither CA-IMT nor the presence of carotid artery plaques correlated with FGF-23 levels. In adjusted ordinal regression analysis, FGF-23 level was an independent predictor for severe CACs together with age, gender, presence of diabetes, time on dialysis and CA-IMT (model r(2) = 0.44, p < 0.001). As a novel finding, the mean CACs was markedly higher in patients with FGF-23 level above median regardless of phosphate levels (p = 0.03).; Conclusions: In HD patients, plasma FGF-23 level is superior to phosphate in the prediction of coronary artery calcification. However, FGF-23 is not associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in HD patients.;

AB  - Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is explained in part by traditional cardiovascular risk factors; by uremia-specific factors; and by abnormalities of mineral metabolism, factors involved in its regulation, and in the vascular calcification process.; Design, Setting, Participants,& Measurements: In an unselected population of 177 patients with calculated GFR (eGFR) between 90 and 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), the link between the mineral metabolism abnormalities (calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product), regulatory factors (parathyroid hormone [PTH], intact PTH [iPTH], vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF 23], and fetuin A), and the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) assessed by coronary angiography were evaluated in three subgroups defined by tertiles of Gensini lesion severity score.; Results: The mean serum values for FGF 23 in the entire study population was 28.1 ± 17.3 RU/ml and for fetuin A was 473.1 ± 156.2 μg/ml. Patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had significantly higher values of FGF 23 compared with patients with eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). The Gensini score values significantly correlated with gender; arterial hypertension; and HDL cholesterol, eGFR, iPTH, FGF 23, and fetuin A levels. After the adjustments for traditional and uremia-related cardiovascular risk factors, the FGF 23 and fetuin A remained significant predictors of the Gensini score.; Conclusions: This study suggests that in a relatively young population with mild-to-moderate alteration of kidney function and with less traditional cardiovascular risk factors, anomalies of the serum FGF 23 and fetuin A levels appear early in the course of disease and are independent major predictors for extent of CAD.;

AB  - Aims: Cardiovascular (CV) events are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and mortality in patients with CKD. However, the role of FGF23 in uremic vasculopathy remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between FGF23 and LVH, endothelial dysfunction, vascular calcification, and arterial stiffness in 48 stable PD patients.; Methods: Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed using 2-D echocardiography. Intact FGF23 blood levels were evaluated using an ELISA kit (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA, USA). Reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and the augmentation index (AI) is a surrogate marker of arterial stiffness. Both were assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT 2000). Vascular calcification (VC) was assessed using the Adragão score.; Results: In unadjusted analysis; FGF23 was positively correlated with serum Pi (r = 0.487, p < 0.001), serum urea (r = 0.351, p = 0.015), serum creatinine (r = 0.535, p < 0.001), dialysis vintage (r = 0.309, p = 0.033), and LVMI (r = 0.369, p = 0.027) and was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.343, p = 0.017), residual renal function (r = -0.359, p < 0.012), and AI (r = -0.304, p = 0.038). In multivariate adjusted analysis, FGF23 was associated with LVMI (β = 0.298, p = 0.041), serum Pi (β = 0.345, p = 0.018), and age (β = -0.372, p = 0.007) independent of dialysis vintage, gender, residual renal function (RRF), albumin, C-reactive protein and systolic blood pressure. There were no associations found between FGF23 and RHI, AI, or VC in multivariable- adjusted models.; Conclusions: Our results show that FGF23 is associated with LVH but not with endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, or vascular calcification in PD patients.;

AB  - Background: Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) develop significant vascular calcification early in life, the cause of which is not yet fully understood. Patients with chronic kidney disease have similar vascular calcification, with fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) implicated in these patients.; Objective: To determine whether there was a difference in FGF23 between patients with HoFH and age- and gender-matched controls and whether there is a correlation between FGF23 and serum low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with HoFH.; Methods: The study was a cross-sectional review involving 30 patients with HoFH attending the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital Lipid Clinic in Parktown, South Africa, as well as 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. FGF23, fasting lipid profiles, calcium, and phosphate were measured. B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid arteries was done to assess the extent and severity of arterial calcification.; Results: There was no difference in mean FGF23 between the patient and control groups (62.07 ± 26.42 pg/mL vs 63.69 ± 19.84 pg/mL; P = .4621) nor was there any correlation between FGF23 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .9483 and .8474) or total cholesterol (P = .9261 and .859). In the HoFH patients, FGF23 did not correlate significantly with any cardiovascular disease.; Conclusions: Serum FGF23 is not elevated in patients with HoFH when compared to non-familial hypercholesterolemia age- and gender-matched controls, and there is no correlation between serum FGF23 and cardiovascular disease in patients with HoFH. FGF23 does not appear to be a major factor for arterial calcification in HoFH.; Copyright © 2018 National Lipid Association. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Insulin resistance (IR) is very common among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Disturbance in mineral and bone metabolism (MBD) seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is evolving as the most important link between MBD and many pathologic sequences of CKD. The aim was to evaluate IR in pre-dialysis CKD patients looking for a possible association to mineral metabolism among CKD patients. A total of 100 stage 3-5 CKD patients were selected beside 20 normal control subjects. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to assess IR in selected cases. Both groups were compared for fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting blood insulin (FBI), HOMA-IR, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25 OH vit D), parathormone (PTH), and uric acid (UA). Correlation study between HOMA_IR and different studied parameters was performed. HOMA-IR is significantly higher in CKD (8.87 ± 3.48 vs. 3.97 ± 0.34 in CKD vs. control, respectively, p < .001). In addition CKD patients have significantly higher FGF23 (235 ± 22.96 vs. 139 ± 12.3 pg/mL, p < .001), PTH (76.9 ± 15.27 vs. 47.9 ± 2.52 pg/mL, p < .001), P (4.3 ± 0.67 vs. 3.6 ± 0.23 mg/dL, p < .001), and UA (5 ± 1.22 vs. 4.85 ± 0.48 mg/dL, p < .001) and significantly lower Ca (8.2 ± 0.3 vs. 8.9 ± 0.33 mg/dL, p < .001), and 25 (OH) vit D (17 ± 5.63 vs. 37 ± 3.43 ng/mL, p < .001). Stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that BMI, GFR, Ca, P, and FGF23 were the only significant predictors of HOMA IR. Increased IR in CKD is a consequence of the uremic status and is intimately associated with disturbed phosphate metabolism and FGF23. Further studies are needed to look for an underlying mechanism.;

AB  - Background: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and vascular calcifications (VC) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.; Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in 55 PD patients who underwent pelvic X-ray to assess for VC. Patients with and without linear calcifications were recorded.; Results: Fifteen patients (27.3%) had linear calcifications on pelvic X-ray. FGF-23 levels were higher in patients with VC (299.5 (30.4-2,410.0) vs. 74.4 (14.8-1,030) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Diabetic patients had lower FGF-23 values (43.2 (14.9-134.0) vs. 103.5 (14.8-2,410) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Patients with residual renal function (RRF) had lower FGF-23 levels (70.6 (14.8-513) vs. 179.5 (30.4-2,410) pg/ml, p = 0.06); however, this did not reach statistical significance. FGF-23 levels, age, creatinine, Ca, dialysis duration and HbA1c were positively correlated with VC, whereas RRF, Ca intake and ALP were negatively associated. Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed FGF-23 levels, age, dialysis duration and RRF to be associated with VC.; Conclusions: FGF-23 levels are associated with VC in PD patients. Further studies are needed to clarify whether it is simply a marker or a potential factor. It may prove to be an important therapeutic target for VC management.; © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is high, with an annual risk of amputation estimated at 13%, and indications for limb revascularization in patients combining ESRD with stage IV PAD (foot gangrene) are still controversial. This case-controlled study compared survival, limb salvage, and quality of life in a group of patients hospitalized for foot gangrene according to their renal status (ESRD versus no renal insufficiency). All patients with ESRD hospitalized for foot gangrene (n = 16) from 1996 to 2002 were compared with a control group with normal creatininemia (n = 24) hospitalized for foot gangrene due to peripheral atherosclerotic arterial disease. The 2 groups were matched for age, sex ratio, and number with diabetes mellitus. After a mean follow-up of 467 +/-410 days, patients with ESRD had a more severe prognosis as regards mortality (68.7% vs 12.5%, p = 0.0005) and major amputation (31% versus 8%, p = 0.09). The ESRD group was characterized by more frequent extensive arterial calcifications (16/16 vs 13/24, p = 0.002), owing to a higher level of the calcium phosphorus product (3.54 +/-1.2 vs 2.4 +/-0.6, p = 0.0023), and by impaired microcirculatory perfusion, as indicated by a lower oxygen pressure (TcPO(2)) (15.6 +/-12 mm Hg vs 26 +/-16, p = 0.07). ESRD implies a poor prognosis in patients with stage IV peripheral arterial disease.;

AB  - Background: Decreased kidney function and greater albuminuria are associated with increased incidence and extent of coronary artery calcium (CAC). We investigated whether the associations between kidney function and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) with CAC differ by HIV serostatus.; Methods: Using data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, a prospective multicenter US study of men who have sex with men, we carried out a cross-sectional study comprised of 592 HIV-infected (HIV+) and 378 uninfected (HIV-) men who underwent noncontrast computed tomography to measure CAC. Logistic and linear regression models were used to determine whether HIV infection modified associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and UPCR with the presence and extent of CAC, adjusting for age, race, and cardiovascular risk factors.; Results: Every 10 U decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate below 90 ml/min/1.73 m was significantly associated with 1.3-fold [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.51] higher odds of CAC presence and was similar by HIV serostatus (Pinteraction=0.37). Greater UPCR was associated with more extensive CAC, with a change in log CAC score of 0.32 (95% CI: 0.10-0.55) per 1% increase in UPCR. There was a strong trend for effect modification by HIV serostatus for this association [HIV-: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.26-1.25); HIV+: 0.22 (95% CI: -0.03 to 0.47), Pinteraction=0.06].; Conclusion: Greater CAC burden is apparent among individuals with early kidney disease, irrespective of HIV serostatus. Increased UPCR is associated with a greater extent of CAC with a trend for differences by HIV serostatus; a clearer proteinuria/CAC extent relationship was apparent among HIV- patients.;

AB  - We retrospectively analyzed data on preoperative vascular mapping in 195 consecutive patients to investigate the common belief that patients with diabetes are poor candidates to have an arteriovenous fistula placed as dialysis access because they lack suitable blood vessels. There was no difference in venous diameter, arterial diameter, and arterial peak systolic velocity measurements between patients with and without diabetes. Patients with diabetes had a greater prevalence of vascular calcifications and greater cuff measurements of systolic segmental arterial pressure. In 140 of 195 patients, subsequent vascular access surgery had been performed in our institution, and 127 of these patients were on hemodialysis therapy at the end of the study period. There was no difference in the prevalence of fistula placement (66% versus 60%; chi-square = 2.6; df = 2; P = 0.28, not significant [NS]) and percentage of functioning fistulae between patients with and without diabetes (67% versus 62%; chi-square = 0.27; df = 1; P = 0.61, NS). The percentage of patients dialyzed through a temporary catheter was equal in patients with and without diabetes (18%). In summary, patients with diabetes seem to be as good candidates for arteriovenous fistula placement as patients without diabetes. Additional studies are required to determine the long-term outcome of fistulae in patients with diabetes.;

AB  - Few studies have provided information on the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs) and their risk factors in hemodialysis patients. A multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study was carried out to assess the prevalence of VFs and vascular calcifications (VCs) in 387 hemodialysis patients (mean age 64.2 ± 14.1 years, 63 % males) and in a control group of 51 osteoporotic subjects. Biochemical tests included 25(OH) vitamin D, bone Gla protein (total and undercarboxylated), and total matrix Gla protein. Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for the detection of VF, defined as reduction by ≥20 % of one of the vertebral body dimensions. In the same radiograph, aortic and iliac VC scores were calculated. Prevalence of VF was 55.3 % in hemodialysis patients and 51.0 % in the control group. Multivariate analysis disclosed that male gender (59.8 vs. 47.6 %, p = 0.02; OR = 1.78, 95 % CI 1.15-2.75) and age (mean ± SD 66.7 ± 13.1 vs. 61.0 ± 14.7 years, p < 0.001; OR = 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05) were significantly associated with VF. The prevalence of aortic VC was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients than in controls (80.6 vs. 68.4 %, p = 0.001). The factors with the strongest association with VC, apart from atrial fibrillation, were serum 25(OH)vitamin D levels below 29 ng/mL for aortic VC (OR = 1.85, 95 % CI 1.04-3.29) and VF both for aortic (OR = 1.77, 95 % CI 1.00-3.14) and iliac (OR = 1.96, 95 % CI 1.27-3.04) VC. In conclusion, the prevalence of VF, especially in males, and VC, in both genders, is high in hemodialysis patients. VF is associated with VC. Vitamin D deficiency is also associated with VC. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate fractures in renal patients.;

AB  - Background: Sclerostin is an osteocyte hormone that decreases osteoblastogenesis. Sclerostin may play a key role in osteoporosis and also in vascular calcification (VC). In chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis (HD) patients, serum sclerostin levels are high.; Aim: To assess the correlation of serum sclerostin levels with VC, bone mineral density (BMD), and survival rate in HD patients.; Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in prevalent HD patients to correlate serum sclerostin tertiles with the Kauppila aortic calcification score, BMD scores and survival rate.; Results: We studied 207 patients who had a mean serum sclerostin level of 1.9 ± 0.7 ng/ml. Compared to patients in the 1st tertile of serum sclerostin levels (0.6-1.53 ng/ml), patients in the 3rd tertile (2.2-4.6 ng/ml) were significantly older (73.7 ± 12 vs. 64.7 ± 18 years), more frequently of the male gender (74 vs. 48%), had lower serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatases values (14 ± 9 vs. 20.4 ± 13 µg/l), were less frequently treated with alfacalcidol, displayed lower aortic calcification scores (9.5 ± 5 vs. 12.5 ± 7/24) and had higher BMD scores. Furthermore, patients of the 3rd tertile displayed a lower mortality rate compared to tertile 1 using multivariable adjusted Cox model (hazard ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.25-0.93, p = 0.03). The main factors associated with VC score were age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, CRP level and Warfarin use.; Conclusion: Our study of HD patients shows that higher serum sclerostin levels are associated with higher BMD, lower aortic calcification scores, and a better survival rate.; © 2016 S.

AB  - Background: Calciprotein particles (CPPs) may play an important role in the calcification process. The calcification propensity of serum (T50) is highly predictive of all-cause mortality in chronic kidney disease patients. Whether T50 is therapeutically improvable, by high-flux hemodialysis (HD) or hemodiafiltration (HDF), has not been studied yet.; Methods: We designed a cross-sectional single center study, and included stable prevalent in-center dialysis patients on HD or HDF. Patients were divided into two groups based on dialysis modality, were on a thrice-weekly schedule, had a dialysis vintage of > 3 months and vascular access providing a blood flow rate > 300 ml/min. Calcification propensity of serum was measured by the time of transformation from primary to secondary CPP (T50 test), by time-resolved nephelometry.; Results: We included 64 patients, mean convective volume was 21.7L (SD 3.3L). In the pooled analysis, T50 levels increased in both the HD and HDF group with pre- and post-dialysis (mean (SD)) of 244(64) - 301(57) and 253(55) - 304(61) min respectively (P = 0.43(HD vs. HDF)). The mean increase in T50 was 26.29% for HD and 21.97% for HDF patients (P = 0.61 (HD vs. HDF)). The delta values (Δ) of calcium, phosphate and serum albumin were equal in both groups. Baseline T50 was negatively correlated with phosphate, and positively correlated with serum magnesium and fetuin-A. The ΔT50 was mostly influenced by Δ phosphate (r = -0.342; P = 0.002 HD and r = -0.396; P<0.001 HDF) in both groups.; Conclusions: HD and HDF patients present with same baseline T50 calcification propensity values pre-dialysis. Calcification propensity is significantly improved during both HD and HDF sessions without significant differences between both modalities.;

AB  - Background: Proteinuria is a marker of graft damage and is closely associated with a higher risk of morbidity, mortality, and cardiovascular disease in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Arterial stiffness is a well-known predictor of vascular calcification and systemic arteriosclerosis. In our study, we aimed to investigate the association between proteinuria and graft/patient survival and to determine whether proteinuria may be a predictor for cardiovascular disease in our KTR population.; Methods: Ninety KTRs (31 women; age, 38.7 ± 11 years, with 45.9 ± 9.6 months post-transplantation period) with normal graft functions in the 3 to 5 years of the post-transplantation period were enrolled. All patients were evaluated for their standard clinical (age, sex, and duration of hemodialysis) parameters. High-grade proteinuria was defined as proteinuria >500 mg/day in the 24-hour urine collection. All patients were evaluated by means of pulse-wave velocity (PWV) measurement at the initiation of the study.; Results: Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (high-grade proteinuria) patients with ≥500 mg/24 hours (n = 30) and group 2 (low-grade proteinuria) patients with <500 mg/24 hours (n = 60). High-grade proteinuria was correlated with higher PWV measurements and lower estimated glomerular filtration levels. Proteinuria appears to precede the elevation of serum creatinine and thus may be a useful marker of renal injury and may also be a contributing factor on deterioration of the graft.; Conclusions: High-grade (>500 mg/day) proteinuria in KTRs is strongly associated with poor graft survival and increased risk of cardiovascular events. In our study, we proved the significant difference between high-grade and low-grade proteinuric patients, and we suggest 500 mg/day as the threshold of proteinuria in KTR population.; Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Adynamic bone is being found with increasing frequency in dialysis patients. Little is known about its aetiology, and even less about its natural history. We found 10 cases of asymptomatic adynamic bone among a group of 32 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients, most of whom had never been exposed to aluminium-containing phosphate binders. Compared to the remaining 22 patients, they had an older mean age (54 +/- 11.4 vs. 42 +/- 11.8 years; p < 0.05), probably a longer pre-dialysis duration of renal failure (10.9 vs. 7.1 years), higher mean ionized calcium (1.30 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.02 mmol/l; p < 0.01), and lower mean intact parathyroid hormone (31.5 vs. 200.3 pg/ml; p < 0.001). The bone density was not different between the two groups, but 9 of the 10 adynamic patients had significant vascular calcification seen on plain radiology as compared with only 7 of 20 in the comparison group (p < 0.05). Follow-up of the adynamic patients showed a close association with serum intact parathyroid hormone and ionized calcium levels. With one exception, adynamic bone did not appear to be associated with lower bone density than other types of osteodystrophy, but a longer-term study is required to determine the complete natural history of this lesion.;

AB  - Background: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease on dialysis. A sizeable proportion of patients has no or minimal CAC at the inception of dialysis, but it is unclear how long they remain free of it.; Methods: For the purpose of this study, 36 incident hemodialysis patients were submitted to sequential chest computed tomography to quantify CAC at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 30 months.; Results: Among them, 15 had absent or minimal CAC score (CACS 0 to 30) and 21 had a CACS>30 at baseline. Overall, the median baseline CACS was 129 (interquartile range [IQR]=0-709) and it increased to 364 (IQR=8.3-1683) at study completion (182% increase). Among the 15 patients with minimal CACS, only 3 progressed and the median CACS increase was 20, as opposed to 15 of 21 patients with a baseline CACS>30 whose median progression was 431 (p<0.02). The 18 patients who had CACS progression were older (68.5 vs. 57.3 years, p=0.0081) and exhibited a poorer control of mineral metabolism (phosphorus 5.2 vs. 4.9 mg/ dL, p=0.048; corrected calcium x phosphorus product [CaxP] 49.3 vs. 46.2 mg2/dL2, p=0.001) than the patients without progression. On multivariable analysis, independent predictors of progression were baseline CACS (p=0.038) and time-averaged Cax;P (p=0.077).; Conclusion: These data suggest that absent or low CAC at baseline is associated with minimal progression even up to 30 months. Careful management of mineral metabolism appears to be one of the main factors that limit progression of CAC.;

AB  - Vascular calcification is a common finding in atherosclerosis and a serious problem in uremic patients. Because of the correlation of hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification, the ability of extracellular inorganic phosphate levels to regulate human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture mineralization in vitro was examined. HSMC cultured in media containing normal physiologic levels of inorganic phosphate (1.4 mM) did not mineralize. In contrast, HSMC cultured in media containing phosphate levels comparable with those seen in hyperphosphatemic individuals (>1.4 mM) showed dose-dependent increases in mineral deposition. Mechanistic studies showed that elevated phosphate treatment of HSMC also enhanced the expression of the osteoblastic differentiation markers osteocalcin and osf2/Cbfa-1. The effects of elevated phosphate on HSMC were mediated by a sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPC) as indicated by the ability of the specific NPC inhibitor phosphonoformic acid to dose-dependently inhibit phosphate-induced calcium deposition as well as osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 gene expression. The NPC in HSMC was identified as Pit-1, a member of the novel type III NPCs. These data suggest that elevated phosphate may directly stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and offers a novel explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic conditions. Furthermore, we examined the factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification in 332 nondiabetic hemodialysis patients. There were 45 nondiabetic patients with vascular calcification. In multivariate logistic regression, the significant factors affecting vascular calcification were advanced age, longer duration of hemodialysis, increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower predialysis diastolic pressure. Our findings suggest that an elevated phosphate level may directly stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and offer a novel explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic conditions.;

AB  - Background/aim: Progressive cardiovascular calcification in dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a serious complication; however, the precise mechanism remains uncertain. We tested whether metabolic calcium abnormalities and hypoparathyroidism might have a correlation with cardiovascular complications in ESRD patients.; Methods: A series of 48 ESRD patients with cardiovascular diseases and/or congestive heart failure, aged 36-82 (61 +/- 12) years, 23 male and 25 female, were enrolled in this study. Serum total calcium (Ca, mmol/l), inorganic phosphate (mmol/l), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, pg/ml) levels were determined in all cases.; Results: Organic heart disease was confirmed in 28 patients (58.3%), including 15 with coronary artery disease: 8 with aortic aneurysm, 8 with stenotic valvular heart disease, 9 with excessive mitral annular calcification, 3 with dialysis cardiomyopathy, and 7 with obstructive arterial disease. Serum iPTH measurement revealed hypoparathyroidism (iPTH <60) in 20 of 48 (41.7%) and hyperthyroidism (iPTH >/=200) in 13 of 48 (27.1%) subjects. The 20 patients with low iPTH had a higher prevalence of valvular heart disease, a higher total Ca level corrected for serum albumin (2.70 +/- 0.30 in low iPTH vs. 2.47 +/- 0.30 in normal iPTH, 2.35 +/- 0.20 in high iPTH, p = 0.003) and a higher tendency of vitamin D(3) analog use (65% in low iPTH vs. 33% in normal iPTH and 46% in high iPTH, p = 0.078). Moreover, corrected serum Ca exhibited a negative logarithmic correlation with serum iPTH: corrected Ca = -0.284x log (iPTH) + 3.021 (r = 0.637, p = 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed diabetes and hypoparathyroidism (iPTH <60) as risk factors for cardiovascular complications in ESRD.; Conclusion: These results suggest that hypercalcemia and hypoparathyroidism in conjunction with vitamin D(3) use might play an important role in cardiovascular complications of chronic dialysis patients.; Copyright 2000 S.

AB  - Background/aims: High BMI increases the risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) in the general population. Conflicting results have been reported on the role of BMI on CVEs and on decline of renal function in patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis (CKD). This study evaluates the impact of BMI on CVEs, dialysis initiation, and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in CKD patients.; Methods: CKD patients were divided in normal-BMI and high-BMI patients. CVEs, initiation of dialysis, and extent and progression of CAC were assessed. Univariate and multivariable analysis were performed (adjustment variables: age, diabetes, hypertension, gender, CKD stage, serum concentration of hemoglobin, parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, C-reactive protein, LDL-cholesterol, total calcium score, 24-hour proteinuria). Patients were followed to the first event (CVE, dialysis) or for 2 years.; Results: 471 patients were evaluated. A CVE occurred in 13.5 and 21.3% (p < 0.05) of normal-BMI and high-BMI patients, respectively. High BMI did not increase the risk for CVEs in univariate (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 0.97-3.54; p = 0.06) or multivariable analysis (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.57-3.14; p = 0.50). High BMI did not increase the risk for initiation of dialysis in univariate (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.58-1.60; p = 0.9) or multivariable analysis (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 0.82-3.81; p = 0.14). Adding the interaction term (between BMI and glomerular filtration rate) to other variables, the risk of dialysis initiation significantly increased (HR: 3.06; 95% CI: 1.31-7.18; p = 0.01) in high-BMI patients. High BMI was not a predictor of CAC extent or progression.; Conclusions: High BMI was not a predictor of CVEs. High BMI increased the risk for dialysis initiation, but high BMI was not associated to CAC extent and progression. The presence of confounders may underestimate the impact of high BMI on dialysis initiation.; © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Objective: Little is known about the effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on plaque morphology in cerebral vessels. We therefore analyzed plaque composition and metabolic and chemical parameters with regard to clinical outcome in patients with advanced carotid artery stenosis (>70%) and normal or impaired renal function.; Methods: Carotid endarterectomy plaques were collected from 114 patients, 51 with CKD and 63 without CKD (mean estimated glomerular filtration rate, 49 ± 9 vs 88 ± 14 mL/min), and analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, and -9), calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin, and inflammatory factors, including fibrinogen, and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured by appropriate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.; Results: Compared with patients without CKD, patients with CKD had significantly more early-stage (11.2% vs 2.8%, P = .002) and end-stage (7.4% vs 0.2%, P = .036) calcification, unstable (50.8% vs 20.4%, P = .001) and ruptured (53.1% vs 32.8%, P = .035) lesions, and a significantly lower amount of collagenous fibers (39.2% vs 54.6%, P = .001). Serum samples of CKD patients had significantly enhanced levels of fibrinogen (393 ± 88 vs 331 ± 60 mg/dL, P = .018), hsCRP (1.7 ± 2.9 vs 0.8 ± 0.9 mg/dL; P = .042), parathyroid hormone (47.3 ± 24.1 vs 32.8 ± 12.2 ng/L, P = .010), fetuin-A (0.21 ± 0.05 vs 0.18 ± 0.04 mg/mL, P = .039), and MMP-7 (13.0 ± 5.3 vs 8.3 ± 3.0 ng/mL; P < 0.001). The incidence of cerebrovascular events >6 months before carotid surgery was significantly increased in CKD patients (84.0% vs 26.2% P < .001).; Conclusions: In patients with CKD and advanced carotid artery stenosis, morphologic changes in plaque composition may contribute to plaque vulnerability and consequently to the risk of cerebrovascular events. Furthermore, relevant serum markers of inflammation, vascular calcification, and vessel wall degradation might be an indication of stroke risk in CKD patients.; Copyright © 2011 Society for Vascular Surgery.

AB  - The progression of coronary atherosclerosis has been influenced by the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study investigated the impact of CKD stages on coronary plaque components observed on optical coherence tomography (OCT). We investigated 296 native coronary lesions with stable angina pectoris treated with stent implantation. All lesions were divided into the three groups according to the values of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, mL min-1 1.73 m-2): the non-CKD group (eGFR ≥60, n = 142), CKD group (15 ≤ eGFR < 60, n = 126), and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) group (eGFR <15 and/or hemodialysis, n = 28). Among the groups, plaque morphologies at the narrowest culprit sites on OCT were evaluated. The CKD group had a larger lipid arc [207.5 (88.3-264.5) vs. 159.3 (73.3-227.7) degrees, P = 0.037] and longer lipid length [2.4 (0.0-5.7) vs. 0.0 (0.0-4.7) mm, P = 0.017] than the non-CKD group. The ESKD group had a thinner fibrous cap [120 (70-258) vs. 170 (100-270) μm, P = 0.044], higher prevalence of plaque rupture (28.6 vs. 12.3 %, P = 0.038), and larger calcification arc [124.8 (0.0-194.3) vs. 0.0 (0.0-125.4) degrees, P = 0.025] than the non-ESKD group (CKD + non-CKD groups). The presence of CKD was related to the growth of lipidic plaques. Furthermore, the advancement in the CKD stage to ESKD affected the occurrence of plaque rupture or progression of calcification.;

AB  - Background: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1) generates inorganic pyrophosphate, a solute that serves as an essential physiological inhibitor of calcification. Inactivating mutations of ENPP1 are associated with generalized arterial calcification of infancy. We hypothesized the ENPP1 K121Q variant to be associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with end-stage renal failure.; Subjects and Methods: We recruited 79 patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis treatment and genotyped them for the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism. Next, we matched to each patient with ENPP1 121KQ genotype (n=15) a respective control with ENPP1 121KK genotype by gender, age, diabetes and duration of dialysis treatment. The matching ratio was 1:1. Severity of coronary calcification was quantified by computed tomography, and aortic stiffness was measured by pulse-wave analysis.; Results: Patients with ENPP1 121KQ genotype had a significantly higher coronary calcium score (1385 vs 94; n=30; P=0.033), and also a higher aortic pulse-wave velocity when compared to matched controls with ENPP1 121KK genotype (13.69 m/s vs 9.37 m/s; P=0.003).; Conclusions: Taken together, our study suggests a potential role of the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism in arterial calcification of patients with end-stage renal failure. Patients heterozygous for the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism have higher coronary calcification scores and increased aortic stiffness, and may benefit from more intense treatment in order to prevent progression of arterial calcification.;

AB  - Background/aims: Sudden death is the major cause of cardiac mortality in dialysis patients, accounting for approximately 60% of cardiovascular deaths. A prolonged QT interval and arterial calcification have been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in different patient populations including patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the association of vascular calcification with corrected QT interval duration in patients with end-stage renal disease.; Methods: We performed a single-center cross-sectional study in patients referred for renal transplantation. Patients taking QT-prolonging agents or with conduction abnormalities were excluded. Aortic calcifications were scored by means of lumbar X-rays.; Results: In the final analysis, 193 patients (118 men, 52 years old) were included. A prolonged QT interval was observed in 26% of the patients. Multivariate analysis showed an independent and direct association between corrected QT duration and the extent of aortic calcifications (p = 0.0004) independent of age, gender, cardiovascular history, electrolytes and parameters of mineral metabolism.; Conclusions: A prolonged QT interval is prevalent in patients with CKD stage 5D. Aortic calcification is associated with a prolonged QT duration, independent of traditional determinants.; Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background/aims: Vascular calcifications are frequently found among dialysis patients, and the calcification process may influence the patient's outcome. The aim of the present study was to determine the role that vascular calcifications may have on autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) survival.; Methods: This study included 90 patients (49 males, mean age 62 ± 11) with a native AVF treated by chronic hemodialysis (HD) for more than one year. The overall vascular calcification scores ranged from 0-11 (Adragao score + vascular access calcification score); patients were categorized into mild (score 0-3; n = 36), moderate (score 4-7; n = 24) and severe (score 8-11; n = 30) calcification groups. AVF survival was then followed for 5 years after calcification measurement or until the patient's death/transplantation.; Results: Patients with more pronounced vascular calcifications were more frequently diabetic and male. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant relationship between calcification score and male gender, diabetes mellitus, previous duration of AVF, low dialysis flow rate and intact parathormone (iPTH) values. After multivariate adjustment for basal differences, Cox proportional analysis revealed a graded impact of calcification scores on AVF failure: moderate scores (were associated with a hazard rate (HR) of 3.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-13.23) and severe scores with an HR of 4.65 (CI 0.97-22.38).; Conclusion: Vascular calcifications are associated with worse survival of native arteriovenous hemodialysis fistulas.; © 2015 S.

AB  - Background: The existence of adynamic bone disease (ABD) as most prevalent form of renal osteodystrophy in recent years and its reduced ability to handle an exogenous calcium load has implied a higher risk for vascular and soft-tissue calcifications. The effect of low dialysate calcium (LCD) on parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion in ABD patients has not yet sufficiently been clarified. This randomized, prospective study aimed to compare the effects of LCD and high calcium dialysate (HCD) on the evolution of bone and mineral parameters related to ABD in dialysis patients.; Methods: 52 out of 60 patients with predialysis intact PTH<100 pg/ml completed this study and were equally distributed over LCD (1.25 mmol/l) or HCD (1.75 mmol/l) treatment. The duration of the study was 6 months and the only peroral phosphate binder administered was calcium carbonate. Total and ionised calcium were measured monthly in serum before and after dialysis while serum parameters relevant to bone were measured at the enrollment and at 3-month intervals.; Results: There were no differences in predialysis mean phosphate or calcium x phosphorus product (Ca x P). The most common side effects of both treatments were comparable. Hypotension occurred in 16% and 17% and cramps in 6% and 8% of the dialysis sessions, in the HCD and LCD group, respectively. The groups did not differ in the mean tCa before dialysis, but this parameter was significantly higher in the HCD group vs. LCD at the end of dialysis (2.59+/-0.18 vs. 2.44+/-0.19 mmol/l; p<0.01). The patients of the HCD group also had a significantly higher mean iCa both before (1.08+/-0.05 vs. 1.04+/-0.06 mmol/l; p=0.02) and at the end of dialysis (1.18+/-0.04 vs. 1.48+/-0.04 mmol/l; p<0.01). There were no differences within the LCD group between baseline and end of dialysis treatment values of tCa and iCa. However, the mean tCa and iCa were markedly increased at the end of dialysis in the HDC group [2.40+/-0.21 vs. 2.59+/-0.18 mmol/l (p<0.01); 1.08+/-0.05 vs. 1.18+/-0.04 mmol/l (p<0.01)]. Mean serum levels of iPTH and total alkaline phosphatase in the LCD group were increased at 3 months and at the end of the study compared with the baseline levels [(38.6+/-22.9 vs. 63.3+/-46.0 vs. 78.6+/-44.7 pg/ml); (59.5+/-18.7 vs. 75.9+/-26.7 vs. 84.0+/-35.4 U/l)], respectively, and bone alkaline phosphatase increased also only after 6 months of treatment (23.4+/-7.3 U/l vs. 35.6+/-22.3). The bone markers in the HCD group did not change. At the end of the study all bone parameters in the LCD group were significantly higher than in the HCD group.; Conclusion: There was an evolution towards parameters reflecting higher bone turnover in patients treated with dialysate calcium of 1.25 mmol/l, probably by prevention of a positive calcium balance and enabling sustained stimulation of PTH secretion. Hence, LCD might be considered a valuable therapeutic option for ABD patients.;

AB  - Background: Calcifications in arteries are thought to represent atherosclerosis.; Methods: Consecutive abdominal tomographic scans performed during a 4-month period were evaluated and assessed for renal artery calcifications (RAC). Scans that showed calcifications were evaluated for renal artery narrowing and for various characteristics of the atherosclerotic plaque.; Results: Of 350 consecutive examinees, 43% were men, 40% had hypertension and 38% had hypercholesterolaemia. The age was 61 +/- 13 years. Aortic calcifications were found in 54% and RAC in 102 (29%), of whom 53 had bilateral calcifications. Subjects with RAC were older, 72 +/- 6 versus 55 +/- 12 years. Adjusted odds ratios of RAC were 2.2 (95% CI 1.1-4.6) for male gender, 2.4 (1.2-4.8) for hypertension and 2.9 (1.4-5.8) for hypercholesterolaemia, whereas family history of hypertension was protective with 0.5 (0.3-0.9). All patients with calcified renal arteries had aortic calcifications, versus 35% of those without RAC. A significant correlation was found between the severity of calcifications and the degree of renal artery narrowing (r = 0.7), and also between the presence of bilateral calcifications and a high-grade narrowing.; Conclusions: RAC strongly relates to atherosclerosis. Calcifications and artery narrowing may have a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Bilateral calcifications suggest atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.;

AB  - Purpose: While it is well known that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for the development and progression of atherosclerosis, it is not known whether arterial inflammation is increased in mild CKD. The aim of this study was to compare arterial inflammation using 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with CKD and in matched controls.; Methods: This restrospective study included 128 patients undergoing FDG PET/CT imaging for clinical indications, comprising 64 patients with stage 3 CKD and 64 control patients matched by age, gender, and cancer history. CKD was defined according to guidelines using a calculated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Arterial inflammation was measured in the ascending aorta as FDG uptake on PET. Background FDG uptake (venous, subcutaneous fat and muscle) were recorded. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was assessed using the CT images. The impact of CKD on arterial inflammation and CAC was then assessed.; Results: Arterial inflammation was higher in patients with CKD than in matched controls (standardized uptake value, SUV: 2.41 ± 0.49 vs. 2.16 ± 0.43; p = 0.002). Arterial SUV correlated inversely with eGFR (r = -0.299, p = 0.001). Venous SUV was also significantly elevated in patients with CKD, while subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue SUVs did not differ between groups. Moreover, arterial SUV remained significantly elevated in patients with CKD compared to controls after correcting for muscle and fat background, and also remained significant after adjusting for clinical risk factors. Further, CKD was associated with arterial inflammation (SUV) independent of the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis (CAC).; Conclusion: Moderate CKD is associated with increased arterial inflammation beyond that of controls. Further, the increased arterial inflammation is independent of presence of subclinical atherosclerosis. Current risk stratification tools may underestimate the presence of atherosclerosis in patients with CKD and thereby the risk of cardiovascular events.;

AB  - Sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation, is linked to mineral bone disorder. In order to validate its potential as a predictor of vascular calcification, we explored associations of circulating sclerostin with measures of calcification in 89 epigastric artery biopsies from patients with end-stage renal disease. Significantly higher sclerostin levels were found in the serum of patients with epigastric and coronary artery calcification (calcification score 100 or more). In Spearman's rank correlations, sclerostin levels significantly associated with age, intact parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and percent calcification. Multivariable regression showed that age, male gender, and sclerostin each significantly associated with the presence of medial vascular calcification. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that sclerostin (AUC 0.68) predicted vascular calcification. Vascular sclerostin mRNA and protein expressions were low or absent, and did not differ between calcified and non-calcified vessels, suggesting that the vasculature is not a major contributor to circulating levels. Thus, high serum sclerostin levels associate with the extent of vascular calcification as evaluated both by coronary artery CT and scoring of epigastric artery calcification. Among circulating biomarkers of mineral bone disorder, only sclerostin predicted vascular calcification.;

AB  - Little is known about the proportion of renal transplant candidates who are considered ineligible by the transplant center, the reasons of their ineligibility and their survival during dialysis. In this retrospective, single-center study of 445 adult patients referred between 2001 and 2006, 36 (8%) were deemed ineligible for medical contraindications. The leading reason was cardiovascular (CV) (75%), specifically aorto-iliac, and/or limb vessels atheromatosis or calcifications; ischemic heart disease; or a combination thereof. Nine patients had other contraindications that were absolute for three of them; six patients displayed a combination of relative contraindications. When compared to eligible patients (N = 409), those ineligible were significantly older (60 yr vs. 48), more often diabetics (50% vs. 15%), obese (39% vs. 17%) suffering from coronary artery disease (53% vs. 11%) and peripheral arterial disease (86% vs. 11%). Their primary nephropathy was more often diabetic and/or hypertensive/nephroangiosclerosis (61% vs. 23%), and their median dialysis vintage prior to evaluation was longer (29 months vs. 10, p < 0.0001). The actuarial survival of ineligible patients was significantly lower than that of eligible patients (at five yr: 53% vs. 88%). Adequate control of CV risk factors before dialysis and early referral for transplantation might help to improve eligibility of renal transplant candidates.; © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Background: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an extensive and common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The aim of this study was to assess prospectively the change in CAC over a 2-year period and to identify the factors that may be associated with CAC progression in ESRD patients.; Methods: The final analysis was performed on 40 of 43 stable haemodialysis patients who initially entered into the study. The study population underwent multirow spiral computed tomography to derive CAC scores at baseline and after a minimum of 12 months (24 months in 30 patients, 18 months in four, and 12 months in the remaining six patients). To provide a stable estimate that was unbiased with respect to the baseline CAC, square root-transformed CAC scores were used for the analyses of the changes in CAC.; Results: The median CAC score was 191 (range, 0-2403) mm3 at baseline and increased to 253 (range, 0-2745) mm3 at follow-up (P < 0.001) and the median annualized change in square root-transformed CAC score was 1.48 (range, -0.95-8.64) mm3/year. The annualized change of the square root-transformed CAC score positively correlated with the time-integrated levels of C-reactive protein (R = 0.521, P = 0.001), phosphorus (R = 0.433, P = 0.005) and calcium x phosphorus product (R = 0.394, P = 0.012), but did not correlate with the levels of fetuin-A or lipid parameters. Even after adjusting for age, gender and baseline CAC score, C-reactive protein levels were independently associated with CAC progression.; Conclusion: These data suggest that chronic inflammation as well as altered mineral metabolism contributes to a rapid progression of CAC in ESRD patients. Additional, larger scale studies are required to confirm our findings.;

AB  - Background: Adequate flow through a newly created arteriovenous fistula depends on multiple characteristics of the vessels and patient comorbidities. Several studies have related preoperative findings to failure, but few have analyzed the influence of intraoperative findings.; Objectives: To evaluate the predictive value of intraoperative findings on the immediate outcome of radial-cephalic arteriovenous wrist fistulas (RCAVF) by collecting data that are easily measured intraoperatively.; Methods: We designed a cross-sectional study, in which a single surgeon performed 101 RCAVF in 100 patients at a single center. We analyzed the immediate postoperative flow, assessed by thrill intensity immediately after fistula creation, against patient demographics and intraoperative data. The following variables were analyzed: age, sex, comorbidities, length of vein visible at preoperative examination, macroscopic arterial calcification, maximum vein diameter, and length of stenosis-free vein, measured by cannulation with a urethral catheter during the procedure. The chi-square test was used both to eliminate possible bias introduced by side of venous access (left or right), and to determine predictive values of immediate thrill.; Results: Side of access was not associated with any significant differences in variables. Absence of macroscopic arterial calcification, successful venous catheterization using a 6 French catheter or larger, and ability to advance it more than 10 centimeters along the lumen of the proximal vein were correlated with adequate immediate postoperative thrill (p = 0.004, p < 0.001, and p = 0.005, respectively).; Conclusions: In this series of 101 RCAVF, both the diameter of the catheter and its progress through the proximal vein and also absence of arterial calcification had positive predictive value for achieving adequate immediate thrill after vascular access construction.;

AB  - Background/aim: Morbidity and mortality of continous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients is still very high. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions (standard vs biocompatible) on long-term patients' and the techique survival.; Methods: A total of 42 stable patients on CAPD participated in this cross-sectional study. They were prospectively followed-up during the twelve years. Patients with severe anemia (Hb < 10 g/L) and malignant disease ware excluded. Twenty one (50%/0) patients were treated with the standard PD solutions (CAPDP-1) while the other 21 (500/0) were treated with biocompatible PD solutions [(lower level of glucose degradation products, lower concentration of Ca(2+) and neutral pH (CAPDP-2)]. All patients were analyzed for a presence of vascular calcification, nutrition status, and parameters of inflammation after 2.5 +/- 0.6 years of starting CAPD, and these variables considered in the analysis as risk factors.; Results: The patients from the group CAPDP-2 compared to those from the group CAPDP-1 had lower level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (p = 0.003), and better nutritional status as confirmed by the mid-arm circumference (p = 0.015), and mid-arm muscle circumference (p = 0.002) and subjective global assessment (p = 0.000). Also, they had lower vascular calcifications as confirmed by intima media thickness (IMT) (p = 0.003), degree of carotid narrowing (p = 0.001) and calcified plaques of common carotid arteries (CCA) (p = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed better survival of patients from the group CAPDP-2 than those from the group CAPDP-1 (1-, 5-, and 10-year patients survival rate was: 100%, 61.9% and 14.3% for the group CAPDP-1, and 100%, 85.7%, and 52.4% for the group CAPDP-2, respectively; p = 0.0345). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year technique survival rate was: 100%, 71.4%, and 38.1% for the group CAPDP-1, and 100%, 85.7%, and 76.2% for the group CAPDP-2, respectively; (p = 0.0719). Duration of dialysis, serum triglyceride and cardiovascular score (quantitative scoring system consisting of: ejection fraction (EF) of left ventricle < 50%; IMT > 1 mm; carotid narrowing degree > 50%, presence of carotid plaques in both common carotide, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular event and peripheral vascular disease with or without amputation) were independent predictors of overall patient survival. Duration of dialysis was only independent predictor of overall technique survival.; Conclusion: Although patients treated with biocompatible solutions showed significantly better survival, the role of biocompatibility of CAPD solutions in patients and technique survival have to be confirmed. Namely, multivariate analysis confirmed that duration of dialysis, serum triglyceride and cardiovascular score significantly predicted overall CAPD patients survival, while only duration of dialysis was found to be independent predictor of overall techique survival.;

AB  - Purpose: Although severe, circumferential calcification of distal outflow vessels is frequently encountered, its effect on bypass graft patency rates has not been well established.; Methods: Using a computerized vascular registry database, we conducted a retrospective review of 1957 bypass grafts with distal anastomoses to infrapopliteal vessels performed at a single institution between 1990 and 1995. Of these cases, 101 procedures involved outflow arteries classified by the operating surgeon as severely calcified and unclampable (requiring intraluminal occluders for vascular control), whereas in 105 cases the outflow arteries had no calcification present at the distal anastomotic site. The remaining cases had varying intermediate degrees of calcification and were not analyzed. Indication for bypass procedure was limb-threatening ischemia in 90% of severe calcification cases and in 84% of cases without calcification. Atherosclerotic risk factors were similar except for the presence of diabetes (92% vs 74%, p < 0.001), creatinine level > 2.0 mg/dl (21% vs 8%, p < 0.01), and dialysis dependency (17% vs 3%, p < 0.001), all of which were more prevalent in the severe calcification group. Infrapopliteal distal anastomotic location and type of conduit ( > 90% autogenous vein) were comparable between groups.; Results: Primary patency, secondary patency, and foot salvage rates at 24 months were 60%, 65%, and 77% for the severe calcification group and 74%, 82%, and 93% for the no calcification group, respectively. With secondary procedures comprising 26% of cases in each group, data from the 150 primary procedures were reanalyzed separately. In this primary procedure group, 24-month primary patency, secondary patency, and foot salvage rates were 66%, 69%, and 77% for the severe calcification group and 84%, 90%, and 96% for the no calcification group, respectively. Although patency and salvage rates were consistently lower for the severe calcification group in all analyses, these differences did not achieve significance by log-rank life-table analysis at 2-year follow-up. Perioperative 30-day mortality (0.99% severe calcification vs 0.95% no calcification) and 24-month survival rates (84% severe calcification vs 83% no calcification) were also similar between groups.; Conclusion: These data suggest that effective techniques exist to perform infrapopliteal bypasses to severely calcified, unclampable outflow arteries with results comparable with those obtained with clampable, uncalcified vessels. The finding of severe, circumferential calcification of outflow target arteries should not dissuade vascular surgeons from distal bypass for limb salvage indications.;

AB  - Objectives: The effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on in-hospital outcomes of chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has received limited study.; Methods: We evaluated the prevalence of CKD and its impact on CTO-PCI outcomes in 1979 patients who underwent 2040 procedures between 2012 and 2017 at 18 centers. CKD was defined as preprocedural estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m².; Results: Compared with patients without CKD (n = 1444; 73%), patients with CKD (n = 535; 27%) had more comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, prior myocardial infarction, PCI, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and stroke), and more severe calcification and proximal vessel tortuosity. Patients with and without CKD had similar technical success rates (84% vs 86%; P=.49) and procedural success rates (83% vs 84%; P=.44). Patients with CKD had higher in-hospital mortality rate (1.9% vs 0.3%; P<.001) and in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rate (4.3% vs 2.2%; P<.01). In-hospital mortality and MACE rates increased with decreasing eGFR levels (P=.03). In multivariate analysis, an independent association was observed between CKD and in-hospital mortality (adjusted odd ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-16.0; P=.02), but not overall MACE (adjusted odds ratio, 1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-2.7; P=.28).; Conclusions: CKD is common among patients undergoing CTO-PCI. High success rates can be achieved in patients with decreased glomerular filtration rate, but CKD may be associated with higher in-hospital mortality.;

AB  - Aim: To determine the associations between insulin resistance, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.; Introduction: FGF-23 is associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, but its association with insulin resistance in CKD has not been explored.; Subjects: Cross sectional study of 72 stage 3-5 CKD patients receiving care in Ontario, Canada.; Materials and Methods: Insulin resistance was measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), FGF-23 was measured by carboxyl terminal enzyme linked immunoassay (ctFGF-23) and CAC was measured by multi-slice computed tomography.; Results: Median HOMA-IR was 2.19μU/ml (interquartile range 1.19 to 3.94). Patients with HOMA-IR>2.2 had greater ctFGF-23 (179.7 vs 109.6; P=0.03), and 40% higher log CAC scores (2.09±0.87 vs 1.58±1.26; P=0.049). Multivariable linear regression adjusted for 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, kidney function, and parathyroid hormone revealed insulin resistance was a risk factor for greater log ctFGF-23 levels (log HOMA IR β=0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.59; P=0.002).; Conclusions: Insulin resistant CKD patients demonstrated higher FGF-23 levels, and increased CAC, while PO4 levels remained normal, suggesting a potential link between insulin resistance and PO4 homeostasis in CKD.; © 2013.

AB  - Aims: Vascular calcification is a common complication among dialysis patients and its pathogenesis involves a variety of factors. The roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines and residual kidney function (RKF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with vascular calcification have not been investigated.; Materials and Methods: 157 stable PD patients were enrolled. All patients had plain X-ray film examination including chest (posterior-anterior view, CXR) and pelvis. Vascular calcification was interpreted as calcified deposit over aortic arch and linear calcification of pelvic arteries. Relevant biochemical data, pro-inflammatory markers, and PD-related factors were measured and collected.; Results: Vascular calcification prevalence in CXRs was higher than that in pelvis films (38.2% vs. 22.3%, p < 0.05). Patients with vascular calcification in CXR had higher incidence of calcification in pelvis films (p < 0.05). Only a minor portion (14.6%) had two calcification sites. Regression analysis revealed that age, PD duration, body mass index, and RKF were independent factors associated with vascular calcification in CXR. Age, diabetes, IL-10 and RKF were factors associated in pelvis films. Factors independently related to vascular calcification in both films were age, duration, diabetes, IL-10, and RKF.; Conclusions: Besides traditional risk factors, IL-10 and RKF were important factors associated with vascular calcification in PD patients.;

AB  - Background: Mortality in dialysis patients remains high and is due mainly to cardiovascular causes. Inflammation has a role in the genesis of accelerated atherosclerosis, vascular calcification, malnutrition and anemia, and a huge impact on the survival of these patients. The pleiotropic effects of statins can be a therapeutic option for reducing chronic inflammatory processes of patients undergoing hemodialysis.; Objective: To evaluate the effects of low doses of simvastatin on inflammatory markers, hematimetric and nutritional parameters of patients undergoing hemodialysis.; Methods: Clinically-stable patients undergoing hemodialysis were classified according to their baseline LDL-cholesterol levels in two groups: those with levels below 100mg/dl (Group 1) and those with levels equal to or greater than 100mg/dl (Group-2), and were treated with simvastatin during eight weeks. Group 1 received 20mg only after each session of hemodialysis (intermittent dose), whereas Group 2 received 20mg/daily. Laboratory data, erythropoietin resistance index and nutritional parameters were obtained before and after treatment.; Results: A significant and equivalent reduction in C-reactive protein levels in both groups was observed (35.97+/-49.23% vs 38.32+/-32.69%, p=0.86). In group 1, there was also a tendency towards reduced resistance to erythropoietin (228.6+/-16.2 vs 208.9+/-16.2, p=0.058) and improvement of hematimetric parameters (hematocrit: 33.1+/-5.9% vs 36.1+/-4.5%, p=0.021).; Conclusion: Intermittent doses proved to be as effective as the usual dose in reducing C-reactive protein levels and resistance to erythropoietin, besides improving the hematimetric parameters, indicating an important reduction of the cardiovascular risk evaluated by these parameters.;

AB  - Background: Uremic vasculopathy, including vascular calcification, increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We have investigated the prevalence and factors associated with vasculopathy in children undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) in a single center.; Methods: Common carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and its relation with demographics, biochemical parameters and medication was analyzed in 60 patients (mean age 12.9 ± 3.4 years; 27 girls) treated with PD (n = 31) or HD (n = 29) for 34 ± 34 months. Patients were divided into two groups: normal cIMT and increased cIMT.; Results: Mean levels of calcium, phosphate and calcium/phosphate product were in the normal range, the but parathyroid hormone level, 729 ± 670 pg/mL, was higher than the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Iniative (K/DOQI) recommendations. Twenty-nine patients had increased cIMT, which was associated with time on dialysis of >2 years, hypercalcemia, higher daily dose of calcitriol and HD (vs. PD). In the multivariate analysis, accounting for time on dialysis, HD persisted as a risk for increased cIMT.; Conclusions: The prevalence of increased cIMT in children on dialysis is similar to that reported in adults with CKD and increased with time on dialysis. HD was associated with increased cIMT, independently of time on dialysis; however, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the possible impact of confounding factors. These results underline the need to monitor and, if possible, prevent and treat increased cIMT in children on dialysis.;

AB  - Intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is associated with ischemic stroke in the general population but this relationship has not been examined in hemodialysis patients. We examined the factors associated with IAC and its relationship with acute ischemic stroke in this population. We retrospectively studied 490 head computed tomographic scans from 2225 hemodialysis patients presenting with neurological symptoms at our center (October 2005-May 2009). Intracranial arterial calcification was graded using a validated scoring system. Multivariate regression was used to examine the factors associated with the presence of IAC, its severity, and its ability to predict acute ischemic stroke. Weibull's survival models analyzed the relationship between IAC severity and survival. Ninety-five percent of patients with ischemic stroke had IAC vs. 83% in the nonstroke group (P=0.02). Intracranial arterial calcification severity increased with age (P<0.001), hemodialysis vintage (P<0.001), serum phosphate (P<0.05), and major comorbidities. In patients with multiple computed tomographic scans during the study period, increased IAC severity at baseline was predictive of acute ischemic stroke (P=0.05) on logistic regression analysis. High-grade and not low-grade IAC was associated with worse survival (P=0.008). Intracranial arterial calcification is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients, especially in those with acute ischemic stroke. Its severity is prognostically significant and associated with risk factors for vascular calcification and may confer a greater risk of acute ischemic stroke. The mechanisms underlying the high incidence of ischemic stroke in this patient group require further comprehensive study.; © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - It is a matter of debate whether vascular calcification and bone loss are simultaneously occurring but largely independent processes or whether poor bone health predisposes to vascular calcification, especially in patients with kidney disease. Here we investigated the association between the changes of microarchitecture in weight bearing bone and the extent of coronary artery calcification in patients with chronic renal failure. The bone microarchitecture of the tibia using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT), bone mineral density using dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the lumbar spine, femoral neck and distal radius as well as coronary artery calcification using multi-slice CT and reported as Agatston score were measured in 66 patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis. Markers of bone turnover, vitamin D status and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were assessed. CAC score was found to be <100 in 39% and ≥100 in 61% of patients. The median [95% CI] total CAC score was 282 [315-2587]. By univariate analysis, significant correlations between CAC and age (R=0.52, p<0.001), weight (R=0.3, p<0.01) and serum cross laps (CTX, R=-0.39, p<0.01) were found, and parameters of bone microarchitecture were numerically but not significantly lower in patients with CAC scores ≥100. In multivariate analysis stratifying for gender and correcting for age, tibial density (Dtot) and bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) were significantly lower in patients with CAC scores ≥100 (p<0.05 for both). Low trabecular bone volume and decreased cortical bone density are associated with coronary artery calcification in dialysis patients.; Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Ionized Magnesium (ion-Mg) represents the active biological fraction of the serum magnesium content. The assessment of total serum Mg (tot-Mg) might not accurately identify patients with hypo-or hyper-magnesaemie. In hemodialysis, serum tot-Mg levels in the upper part of the distribution, have been associated with reduced mortality and fewer vascular calcifications; thus, resulting in the tendency to increase the Mg concentration in the dialysate, traditionally set at 0.5 mmol/L.; Methods: Single-center study in chronic hemodialysis patients, designed in two phases, cross-sectional and longitudinal, aimed to investigate: (1) the sensitivity for pathological values of ion-Mg compared to tot-Mg (2) the predictors of ion-Mg developing ad hoc equations; (3) the inter- and intra-individual variabilities of ion-Mg; and (4) the risk factors for hypermagnesemia. Tot-Mg, ion-Mg, and covariates of 42 hemodialysis sessions, in 42 patients during the cross-sectional phase and of 270 sessions in 27 patients in the longitudinal one were analysed.; Results: Ion-Mg significantly correlates with tot-Mg: β = 0.52; r = 0.88, p < 0.001. Multiple linear regressions in normo- and hypo-albuminemic patients gave the following results: ion-Mg = tot-Mg/2-K+/50 + Ca2+/5-HCO3-/100 and ion-Mg = tot-Mg/2 + albumin/100. Ion-Mg showed a high temporal variability in the longitudinal phase (between months p < 0.001; winter vs. summer, p < 0.027). A high intra-individual variability was also found: coefficient of variation 0.116. Comparing patients with high and low intra-individual variability, we found: age 67 vs. 77 years; p < 0.001; urea 26.3 ± 0.5 vs. 21.2 ± 0.4 mmol/L, p < 0.001; nPCR 0.92 ± 0.1 vs. 0.77 ± 0.1 g/kg day, p < 0.001; PTH 46.3 ± 4 vs. 28.5 ± 3 pmol/L, p < 0.001.; Conclusions: Ion-Mg can be useful in unmasking unrecognized hyper- and hypo-magnesemic and false hyper-magnesemic patients. Ion-Mg is characterized by high intra- and inter-individual variabilities particularly in younger women and those with better nutrition. Patients with greater variability could potentially be at risk if exposed to higher concentrations of magnesium in the dialysate. An interventional study, with controlled increase of magnesium concentrations in the dialysate has been planned.;

AB  - Patients surviving more than 10 years on hemodialysis (HD) are at risk of developing serious morbidity from unrelated conditions and from the many complications of long-term dialysis, such as cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, malignant tumors ectopic vascular calcification, diabetes mellitus, and disuse atrophy of the bladder. Long-term dialysis affects transplant patient outcomes and long-term graft survival. We analyzed 436 patients who underwent kidney transplantations between January 1987 and December 2007 to determine the impact of long-term dialysis on kidney transplant outcomes. The 39 patients who had been treated pretransplantation with dialysis for more than 10 years had an average length of dialysis treatment of 15.8 years (range, 10.0-32.5 years); they were denoted as the long-term hemodialysis group. The remaining 397 recipients showed an average of 3.7 years period of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (range, 0-9.8, years; short-term hemodialysis group). There were significant differences in patient survival rates between the 2 groups: 93.2% vs 98.6%, at 1 year; 79.3% vs 95.4% at 5 years; and 58.4% vs 93.1% at 10 years (P = .0034). Also, graft survival was significantly different between the 2 groups: 89.2% vs 95.8% at 1 year; 60.4% vs 88.5% at 5 years; and 33.4% vs 80.4% at 10 years (P = .0026). Our results suggest that dialysis treatment for more than 10 years produces negative effects on post-transplantation patient and graft survival.;

AB  - Background: Valvular and vascular calcification are important early aging phenotypes and represent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Klotho is a gene primarily expressed in the kidney that has an important role in calcium-phosphate homeostasis. The functional KL-VS variant of Klotho has been associated with aging and cardiovascular disease in human studies, but its role in valvular and vascular calcification remains unknown. We performed a candidate gene study in the Framingham Offspring Cohort to evaluate the effect of KL-VS variant of the Klotho gene on valvular calcification.; Methods: We analyzed the Klotho KL-VS genotype (rs9536314) from the Affymetrix 550K genome-wide dataset, distributed by dbGAP, on 1389 cases and 2139 controls from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls. Valvular calcification was defined as presence of calcification on the mitral annulus or the aortic valve as determined by echocardiography. A sensitivity analysis of coronary artery calcification by electron beam computed tomography was performed on 1363 patients.; Results: The frequency of the TT versus the TG allele was not different between the cases and the controls (39 versus 41%). The KL-VS variant of Klotho was not associated with valvular or vascular calcification, despite adequate power to detect association (86% for odds ratios ≥1.2). In sensitivity analyses, no association (P > 0.001) between other common variants of Klotho, β-Klotho or fibroblast growth factor-23 and the end points of valvular or vascular calcification was observed.; Conclusions: In our adequately powered candidate gene study, we did not observe an association with the functional KL-VS variant of Klotho and presence of valvular or vascular calcification. Future studies aimed at combining cohorts with echocardiographic phenotypes need to be conducted to identify genetic variants associated with valvular calcification.;

AB  - Background and Objectives: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with future cardiovascular events and/or death of patients on hemodialysis (HD). We investigated whether progression of CAC in patients on HD could be delayed by switching from a calcium (Ca)-based phosphate (Pi) binder to lanthanum carbonate.; Design, Setting, Participants, and Measurements: The CAC scores were evaluated at study enrollment and after 6 months in 52 patients on HD using calcium carbonate (CC) as a Pi binder. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups assigned to receive either CC or lanthanum carbonate (LC), and the CAC scores were evaluated after a 6-month treatment period. Progression of CAC was assessed, as were serum levels of Ca, Pi, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH).; Results: Forty-two patients completed the study (23 receiving CC and 19 receiving LC). In the 6 months prior to randomization, all patients were treated with CC. During this 6-month period, the CAC scores increased significantly in all 42 patients. Once randomized, there was significantly less progression in the group treated with LC than with CC. Changes in CAC scores from 6 to 12 months were significantly smaller in the LC group than the CC group (-288.9 ± 1176.4 vs 107.1 ± 559.6, P = .036), and percentage changes were also significantly different (-6.4% vs 41.2%, P = .024). Serum Ca, Pi, and iPTH levels were similar in both groups during the study period.; Conclusions: This pilot study suggested that LC delayed progression of CAC in patients on HD compared with CC.;

AB  - Background: Higher levels of serum phosphorus and calcium are associated with increased haemodialysis (HD) patient mortality. Both of these factors act synergistically to promote vascular smooth muscle differentiation to an osteoblast-like phenotype and subsequent vascular calcification. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of interdialytic interval on serum levels, as well as the influence of oral calcium-based phosphate binder load on the magnitude of the observed differences.; Methods: We studied 100 patients undergoing HD three times per week, over a 2 week period. Haemoglobin, albumin, calcium and phosphate were measured pre-dialysis before each HD session. Oral phosphate binder usage was recorded. All patients were treated with dialysate containing 1.25 mEq/l calcium.; Results: Both mean serum phosphate and calcium were higher after the long interdialytic interval (1.59+/-0.05 vs 1.45+/-0.04 mmol/l, P = 0.0005, and 2.46+/-0.03 vs 2.4+/-0.02 mmol/l, P = 0.001, for serum phosphate and uncorrected calcium, respectively). There were no significant differences in haemoglobin or serum albumin, indicating that variable dilution from an increased hydration status in the long interdialytic interval was unlikely to contribute to these observed differences. A total of 74 patients were treated with calcium-containing binders and 26 patients with sevelamer. Patients on sevelamer did not exhibit the observed cyclical increase in serum calcium seen in patients on calcium-containing binders (mean difference in serum calcium 0.09+/-0.01 mmol/l in the calcium-treated group vs 0.01+/-0.01 mmol/l in the sevelamer-treated patients, P = 0.0004). The increase in serum calcium after the long interval as compared with the short interval was proportional to the daily amount of the oral calcium-containing binder load ingested (r = 0.63, P<0.0001).; Conclusion: Cyclical differences in interdialytic interval and overall exposure to both dietary phosphate and oral calcium load influence serum levels. This may have consequences for registry reporting, therapy modulation and potentially the pathogenesis of accelerated vascular calcification seen in HD patients.;

AB  - Background: The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet is effective for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients. Changes to reimbursement of cinacalcet in Australia provided an opportunity to assess effects of medication cessation on biochemical and clinical outcomes in dialysis patients, including changes to novel biomarkers such as calciprotein particles (CPP). CPP are nanoparticles of mineral and protein in the circulation associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease.; Methods: Dialysis patients from a single center who ceased cinacalcet between August 2015 and March 2016 were included in a prospective observational study. Bloods were taken at the time of cessation of cinacalcet and at 1, 6 and 12 months. Clinical and biochemical outcomes were compared with an age- and gender-matched cohort of cinacalcet-naïve dialysis patients.; Results: Sixty-two patients participated in the study. Mean age was 69.6 ± 13.2 years. Biochemical changes over 12 months following cessation of cinacalcet included an increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (42.2 [IQR 27.8-94.6] pmol/L to 114.8 [83.9-159.1] pmol/L [p < 0.001]), serum calcium (2.31 ± 0.21 mmol/L to 2.46 ± 0.14 mmol/L [p < 0.001]) and primary CPP (CPP-I) (p = 0.002). Changes in CPP were associated with an increase in PTH (p = 0.007), calcium (p = 0.002) and ferritin (p = 0.02) but a reduction in serum albumin (p = 0.001). Over the 12-month period, there were two fractures, five cardiovascular events, one episode of calciphylaxis, and one parathyroidectomy, with a mortality rate of 19% (n = 13).; Conclusion: Uniquely we report the effects of cinacalcet withdrawal in a real world setting with demonstrated increases in PTH, serum calcium and CPP subsets, novel CKD-MBD related factors, over a 12-month period.;

AB  - Background/aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with large artery remodeling, endothelial dysfunction and calcification, with angiotensin II (Ang II) a known driver of these pathologies. We investigated long-term Ang II type 1 receptor inhibition with valsartan on aortic function and structure in the Lewis polycystic kidney (LPK) rat model of CKD.; Methods: Mixed sex LPK and Lewis control (total n = 28) treated (valsartan 60 mg/kg/day p.o. from 4 to 18 weeks) and vehicle groups were studied. Functional responses to noradrenaline (NA), potassium chloride and endothelium-dependent and independent relaxations were investigated in vitro using acetylcholine hydrochloride (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), respectively. Effects of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) substrate L-arginine, NOS inhibitor L-NAME and cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin on ACh responses were examined.; Results: In the LPK, valsartan reduced systolic blood pressure and urinary protein, ameliorated exaggerated sensitivity to NA, and normalized endothelium-dependent (ACh-Rmax; 91 ± 7 vs. 59 ± 6%, p = 0.0001) and independent dysfunction (SNP-Rmax; 99 ± 1 vs. 82 ± 7%, p = 0.040), as well as improving NO-dependent relaxation (Rmax; -51 ± 6 vs. -26 ± 9%, p = 0.008). Valsartan also reduced aortic wall hypertrophy, elastin disruption/fragmentation, calcification, media cystic degeneration, and levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9.; Conclusions: This study highlights the role of Ang II in driving vascular manifestations of CKD and indicates that early treatment can significantly limit pathological changes.; © 2016 S.

AB  - Background: Calciphylaxis is a rare condition associated with chronic renal failure and entails a very poor prognosis. Pathogenesis is poorly understood but involves abnormalities in calcium and phosphorus metabolism that lead to vascular and extravascular calcification. Patients present with painful ulcerating plaques that progress to gangrenous wounds. Parathyroidectomy has been advanced as a life-saving intervention in these patients, but long-term results with wound healing and survival after parathyroidectomy are not well described.; Methods: Between January 1987 and October 2003, 15 patients with biopsy-confirmed calciphylaxis were treated at the University of Wisconsin. Of these 15 patients, 9 were treated with medical therapy (bisphosphonates and phosphate binders), whereas 6 underwent parathyroidectomy. The medical records were reviewed, and patients or relatives were interviewed. Survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis.; Results: Four patients underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy, and two patients underwent total parathyroidectomy. All had reductions in the intact parathyroid hormone level (mean +/- SD, 25.2 +/- 4.5 pg/mL). Whereas all six patients treated with parathyroidectomy had partial/complete wound healing, only two of nine in the medical group had any improvements in the skin lesions (P = .006). With up to 80 months of follow-up, patients who underwent parathyroidectomy had a longer median survival compared with those who did not have surgery (39 vs. 3 months; P = .017).; Conclusions: On the basis of our long-term follow-up of this patient population, subtotal or total parathyroidectomy was associated with long-term survival and was more likely to promote healing if performed earlier in the course of disease. Therefore, patients with calciphylaxis from secondary hyperparathyroidism should be referred promptly for potential parathyroidectomy.;

AB  - The optimal surgical procedure for severe renal secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is still a point of controversy. Total parathyroidectomy (PTX) without auto-transplantation was abandoned for fear of an adynamic bone condition; however, in the case of autotransplantation recurrent sHPT is frequent and promotes atherosclerosis. We studied 11 hemodialysis patients (age 59+/-12 years) on dialysis for 18 (12-30) years in whom total PTX was performed due to severe sHPT (group I; intact PTH: 1,240+/-230 pg/ml), and 5 patients (age 55+/-10 years) without renal insufficiency who inadvertently received total PTX during thyroid surgery (group II). After total PTX (group I, 26+/-18 [9-59] months; group II, 252+/-188 [22 480] months) both groups showed no measurable intact PTH levels. Calcium homeostasis was maintained by oral substitution with calcium (group I, calcium dialysate of 2.0 mmol/l), vitamin D and calcitriol (serum parameters in groups I and II: calcium 2.4 and 2.2 mmol/l; phosphate 1.8 and 1.1 mmol/l; 25(OH)-vitamin D(3) 21 and 34 ng/ml; 1,25(OH)(2)-vitamin D(3) 32 and 41 pg/ml, respectively). In group I, after total PTX there was a rapid and sustained improvement in bone pain with markedly enhanced physical activity and endurance. High turnover osteopathy markedly improved as indicated by declining levels of native osteocalcin (90+/-17 vs. 26+/-18 ng/ml), bone alkaline phosphatase (74+/-12 vs. 12+/-6 ng/ml), and carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type-I collagen (65+/-16 vs. 40+/-21 ng/ml) but increasing levels of carboxyterminal propeptide of type-I procollagen (120+/-36 vs. 148+/-41 ng/ml). Recalcification of bone was excellent as demonstrated by X-ray and confirmed by bone histology. Itching extravascular calcific deposits and calcifications of blood vessel and cardiac valves immediately stopped after total PTX. Moreover, 6 sHPT patients suffered from severe atherosclerotic lesions such as thoracic aortic aneurysm (n = 3) or abdominal aortic aneurysm (n = 3) which showed size progression before but not after total PTX when annually controlled by ultrasonography. In group II, even long after total PTX, there was no clinical, radiological, histological or biochemical evidence for low turnover osteopathy. In conclusion, our data indicate that substitution with vitamin D(3) metabolites and calcium can prevent deleterious bone effects of hypoparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients and in patients with normal kidney function and may compensate for the missing PTH action. Over this, a better survival rate is expected as a consequence of the beneficial effect of total PTX on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. We suggest reconsideration of total PTX without autotransplantation in dialysis patients with severe sHPT who are not eligible for renal transplantation.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification is common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and a central characteristic of the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease observed in dialysis patients. Fetuin-A, a circulating calcium-regulatory glycoprotein that inhibits vascular calcification, is associated with inflammation and outcome in dialysis patients. In the present study, we evaluated the association between fetuin-A, clinical phenotype, and outcome, as well as the impact of fetuin gene (AHSG) polymorphisms on the protein product and outcome.; Methods: In a cohort of 258 (161 males) ESRD patients starting renal replacement therapy [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 6.8 +/- 0.2 mL/min] aged 52 +/- 1 years the following parameters were studied: presence of malnutrition (subjective global assessment), comorbidity [diabetes mellitus and clinical manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD)], carotid plaques (N= 101), hs-CRP, fetuin-A, S-albumin, interleukin (IL)-6, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AHSG gene (N= 215) at amino acid positions Thr248Met (C-->T), Thr256Ser (C-->G), Asp276Asn (G-->A), and Arg317Cys (C-->T).; Results: Both all-cause (P < 0.001) and cardiovascular (P < 0.001) mortality were associated with low fetuin-A levels independently of age, smoking, diabetes, S-albumin, CVD, and inflammation (CRP > or =10 mg/L). Inflamed (0.199 vs. 0.247 g/L; P < 0.01) and malnourished (0.207 vs. 0.262 g/L; P < 0.05) patients had significantly lower median fetuin-A than noninflamed and well-nourished ESRD patients, respectively. In a logistic regression model (N= 101), fetuin-A was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the presence of carotid plaques independently of age, CVD, diabetes, S-albumin, gender, and inflammation. Significant correlations were observed between fetuin-A and both S-albumin (Rho = 0.30; P < 0.0001) and IL-6 (Rho =-0.21; P < 0.01). Patients with the AHSG 256Ser allele had lower serum fetuin-A levels, and higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rate if they were inflamed.; Conclusion: The present study shows that a low fetuin-A level is associated with malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (carotid plaques), as well as with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Because the present study demonstrates an effect of variations in the AHSG gene on both circulating fetuin-A levels and outcome, this indicates that ESRD patients with the AHSG 256Ser allele are at risk of accelerated vascular calcification.;

AB  - Background: Fetuin-A, a negative acute phase protein that inhibits vascular calcification, has a controversial association with mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Chronic inflammation, which is common in CKD, may promote vascular calcification.; Materials and Methods: We investigated the impact of inflammation on the relationship between serum fetuin-A and mortality (42 months) in 222 prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients.; Results: Serum fetuin correlated negatively with comorbidity score (assessed by Davies score) and circulating inflammatory markers. Patients with low fetuin-A levels (< median) had higher mortality (Hazard ratio 'HR' 2.2; CI 1.4-3.5, P < 0.001), but this association was lost after adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities score, dialysis vintage and inflammation (CRP > median). In inflamed patients with low fetuin a significantly independent association with mortality (HR 2.3; CI 1.2-4.5, P = 0.01) was observed compared to non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A, after adjusting for the same variables. Non-inflamed patients with low fetuin-A and inflamed patients with high fetuin-A did not have increased mortality compared to non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A.; Conclusions: The results show that low levels of serum fetuin-A are associated with increased mortality in HD patients only in the presence of inflammation. This suggests that coexistence of a low serum fetuin-A level and low-grade inflammation exerts an additive effect on the risk of death in HD patients.;

AB  - Introduction: Higher calcium dialysate is recommended for quotidian nocturnal hemodialysis (NHD) (≥6 nights/week) to maintain bone health. It is unclear what the optimal calcium dialysate concentration should be for alternate night NHD. We aimed to determine the effect of low calcium (LC) versus high calcium (HC) dialysate on cardiovascular and bone parameters in this population.; Methods: A randomized controlled trial where participants were randomized to LC (1.3 mmol/L, n = 24) or HC dialysate (1.6 or 1.75 mmol/L, n = 26). Primary outcome was change in mineral metabolism markers. Secondary outcomes included change in vascular calcification (VC) scores [CT abdominal aorta (AA) and superficial femoral arteries (SFA)), pulse wave velocity (PWV), bone mineral density (BMD) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) over 12 months.; Findings: In the LC group, pre-dialysis ionised calcium decreased -0.12 mmol/L (-0.18-0.06, P = 0.0001) and PTH increased 16 pmol/L (3.5-28.5, p = 0.01) from baseline to 12 months with no significant change in the HC group. In both groups, there was no progression of VC in AA or SFA and no change in PWV, LVMI or BMD. At 12 months, calcimimetics were prescribed in a higher percentage in the LC vs. HC groups (45.5% vs. 10.5%) with a lower proportion of the HC group being prescribed calcitriol (31.5% vs. 72%).; Discussion: Although dialysate calcium prescription influenced biochemical parameters it was not associated with difference in progression of VC between HC and LC groups. An important finding was the potential impact of alternate night NHD in attenuating progression of VC and inducing stabilisation of LVMI and PWV.; © 2016 International Society for Hemodialysis.

AB  - Aims: The association of coronary arterial calcification with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well-recognized. Lower limb arterial calcification (LLAC) is common in PAD but its impact on subsequent health is poorly described. We aimed to determine the association between a LLAC score and subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (PAD).; Methods: LLAC scoring, and the established Bollinger score, were derived from a database of unenhanced CT scans, from patients presenting with symptomatic PAD. We determined the association between these scores outcomes. The primary outcome was combined cardiac mortality and morbidity (CM/M) with a secondary outcome of all-cause mortality.; Results: 220 patients (66% male; median age 69 years) were included with follow-up for a median 46 [IQR 31-64] months. Median total LLAC scores were higher in those patients suffering a primary outcome (6831 vs. 1652; p = 0.012). Diabetes mellitus (p = 0.039), ischaemic heart disease (p = 0.028), chronic kidney disease (p = 0.026) and all-cause mortality (p = 0.012) were more common in patients in the highest quartile of LLAC scores. The area under the curve of the receiver operator curve for the LLAC score was greater (0.929: 95% CI [0.884-0.974]) than for the Bollinger score (0.824: 95% CI [0.758-0.890]) for the primary outcome. A LLAC score ≥ 4400 had the best diagnostic accuracy to determine the outcome measure.; Conclusion: This is the largest study to investigate links between lower limb arterial calcification and cardiovascular events in symptomatic PAD. We describe a straightforward, reproducible, CT-derived measure of calcification-the LLAC score.;

AB  - Background/aims: Vascular calcification, which involves an active cellular transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into bone forming cells, is prevalent and predicts mortality in dialysis patients. Its mechanisms are complex and unclear. We presume that irisin, a newly identified myokine also may play roles in vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. This study aims to evaluate serum irisin levels and establish their relation to vascular calcification and other parameters in hemodialysis patients.; Methods: A total of 150 patients on maintenance hemodialysis treatment and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Serum irisin concentrations were measured by ELISA. Vascular calcification was evaluated by abdominal aortic calcification scores.; Results: Serum irisin concentrations were significantly lower in hemodialysis patients than in controls [52.8 (22.0, 100.0) vs. 460.8 (434.8, 483.4) ng/ml, P<0.01]. In addition, irisin was negatively correlated with the parathyroid hormone level (P=0.01). The HD patients with vascular calcification showed significantly lower serum irisin concentrations [39.0 (21.7, 86.2) vs.79.0 (39.5, 130.2) ng/mL, P<0.01]. Compared with the group without vascular calcification multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that serum irisin, HD vintage and age were significant independent determinant factors for vascular calcification in HD patients.; Conclusion: Our results are the first to provide a clinical evidence of the association between serum irisin and vascular calcification in HD patients. Lower irisin levels, long-term hemodialysis and old ages are independent risk factors in HD patients.; © 2018 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (Aix), and vascular calcification have been associated with an unfavourable cardiovascular outcome in hemodialysis patients. However, the majority of data have been published in white patients and epidemiological data are discordant on the fate of patients of different races. In this cross sectional study we measured PWV and Aix by applanation tonometry and coronary artery and thoracic aorta calcium score (CAC and AoC) by electron beam tomography (EBT) in 81 Blacks and 61 Whites on maintenance hemodialysis. Vascular stiffness measurements and EBT scans were performed within a week of each other. There was no difference between races in age, systolic blood pressure or gender distribution. Blacks had a more frequent history of hypertension (100% versus 89%; P=0.002), lower prevalence of dyslipidemia (30% versus 66%; P<0.001), higher PTH levels (geometric mean 607 pg/ml versus 245 pg/ml; P=0.039), received calcium based phosphate binders less frequently (37% versus 60%, P=0.007) and calcium antagonists more frequently than Whites (54% versus 28%; P=0.003). Nonetheless, the unadjusted and risk adjusted PWV and Aix, as well as CAC and AoC were not statistically different between races. In this dialysis cohort there was no difference in markers of vasculopathy between black and white patients despite differences in baseline clinical characteristics. Epidemiological data from the general population indicate that Blacks have lower calcium scores and stiffer vessels than Whites. Some studies in the renal populations suggest a better and others a similar survival of Blacks and Whites on hemodialysis. Our findings raise the important question of the prognostic significance of markers of vasculopathy in patients of different races and with different risk profiles.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis are major causes of death in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of enzymes, involved in the biology of extracellular matrix and in atherogenesis. MMP1 and MMP3 contribute to the enlargement and instability of atherosclerotic plaque, respectively. The common polymorphisms on MMP1 (2G/2G) and MMP3 (6A/6A) gene promoters have been related to increased coronary artery calcification and to carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of MMP1 and MMP3 polymorphisms with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) and all-cause mortality risk in HD.; Methods: Ninety-nine HD patients, followed-up for 36 months, and 133 matched controls were genotyped for the two polymorphisms. HD patients' characteristics were age 64 +/- 13 years, males 64%, diabetic 24%, hypertensive 62%, smokers 38%, dyslipidaemic 28%, all undergoing standard HD thrice weekly.; Results: ESRD was strongly associated with the combination of 2G/2G and 6A/6A homozygosity: OR 2.57 (0.95-7.4), P = 0.037, but not with isolated 2G/2G and 6A/6A homozygosity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.11, respectively). Isolated 2G/2G was associated with all-cause mortality risk independently from age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidaemia, C-reactive protein, albumin, dialysis vintage and history of cardio-vascular disease: HR 2.96 (1.29-6.80), P = 0.01. A trend for the association of mortality and isolated 6A/6A homozygosity was also observed: HR 3.01 (0.88-10.26), P = 0.078. Combination of 2G/2G and 6A/6A homozygosity significantly increased the mortality risk in the same Cox regression model: HR 4.69 (1.72-12.81), P = 0.003.; Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that MMP-1 and MMP-3 gene polymorphisms are negative prognostic risk factors for all-cause mortality in HD patients, independently from traditional risk factors. These data may have important implications for better understanding the pathogenesis of the increased mortality in HD patients.;

AB  - Aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes are the prominent risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 regulate vascular structure by degrading elastic fibre and inhibit angiogenesis by generating angiostatin. We hypothesized that MMP-2 and -9 were up-regulated in the arterial vasculature from CKD patients with diabetes, compared with those without diabetes.; Methods and Results: During living donor transplantation procedures, arteries from donors (n = 8) and recipients (non-diabetic, n = 8; diabetic, n = 8; matched in age, gender, and dialysis treatments) were harvested. Diabetic arteries had increased MMP-2 and -9 activities by 42 and 116% compared with non-diabetic ones. Diabetic arteries were the stiffest, and the stiffness measurement was highly correlated with the summation of MMP-2 + MMP-9 activities (r = 0.738, P = 0.0002). Pulse wave velocity measurements correlated with MMP activity (r = 0.683, P = 0.005). Elastic fibre degradation and calcification were worst in diabetic vessels. The phosphate level, which was 25% higher in diabetic patients, correlated with MMP activity (r = 0.513, P = 0.04) and in vitro stiffness (r = 0.545, P = 0.03), respectively. Angiostatin expression was doubled, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor was 50% reduced in diabetic compared with non-diabetic vessels. Microvascular density in diabetic vessels was 48% of that in non-diabetic ones, and it was strongly associated with MMP activity (r = -0.792, P < 0.0001) and vasorelaxation (r = 0.685, P = 0.0009).; Conclusion: Using a matched case-control design, we report up-regulation of MMP-2 and -9 in diabetic CKD arteries and correlate those with stiffening, impaired angiogenesis, and endothelial dysfunction. These findings may help to explain the high susceptibility of CVD in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD patients.;

AB  - Medical arterial calcification was studied among 4,553 subjects in a 20-year, longitudinal study of Pima Indians. The prevalence and incidence of medial arterial calcification were highest among men, the elderly, and patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Medial arterial calcification was most commonly observed in the feet and appeared to progress proximally. Proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate risk factors for medial arterial calcification in the feet and to evaluate medial arterial calcification as a risk factor for death and for complications of diabetes. Among diabetic patients, risk factors for medial arterial calcification were impaired vibration perception, long duration of diabetes, and high plasma glucose concentration (p less than 0.01 for each). Among nondiabetic subjects, age, male gender (p less than 0.01 for each), and high serum cholesterol concentration (p = 0.02) were risk factors for medial arterial calcification. Nondiabetic subjects with medial arterial calcification did not have higher mortality rates than subjects without medial arterial calcification (rate ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval = 0.7-1.3). Diabetic patients with medial arterial calcification, compared with diabetic patients without medial arterial calcification, had 1.5-fold the mortality rate (95% confidence interval = 1.0-2.1), 5.5-fold the rate of amputations (95% confidence interval = 2.1-14.1), 2.4-fold the rate of proteinuria (95% confidence interval = 1.3-4.5), 1.7-fold the rate of retinopathy (95% confidence interval = 0.98-2.8), and 1.6-fold the rate of coronary artery disease (95% confidence interval = 0.48-5.4).;

AB  - Background: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) for hemodialysis frequently fail to mature because of inadequate dilation or early stenosis. The pathogenesis of AVF nonmaturation may be related to pre-existing vascular pathologic states: medial fibrosis or microcalcification may limit arterial dilation, and intimal hyperplasia may cause stenosis.; Study Design: Observational study.; Setting& Participants: Patients with chronic kidney disease (N = 50) undergoing AVF placement.; Predictors: Medial fibrosis, microcalcification, and intimal hyperplasia in arteries and veins obtained during AVF creation.; Outcome& Measurements: AVF nonmaturation.; Results: AVF nonmaturation occurred in 38% of patients despite attempted salvage procedures. Preoperative arterial diameter was associated with upper-arm AVF maturation (P = 0.007). Medial fibrosis was similar in patients with nonmaturing and mature AVFs (60% ± 14% vs 66% ± 13%; P = 0.2). AVF nonmaturation was not associated with patient age or diabetes, although both variables were associated significantly with severe medial fibrosis. Conversely, AVF nonmaturation was higher in women than men despite similar medial fibrosis in both sexes. Arterial microcalcification (assessed semiquantitatively) tended to be associated with AVF nonmaturation (1.3 ± 0.8 vs 0.9 ± 0.8; P = 0.08). None of the arteries or veins obtained at AVF creation had intimal hyperplasia. However, repeated venous samples obtained in 6 patients during surgical revision of an immature AVF showed venous neointimal hyperplasia.; Limitations: Single-center study.; Conclusion: Medial fibrosis and microcalcification are frequent in arteries used to create AVFs, but do not explain AVF nonmaturation. Unlike previous studies, intimal hyperplasia was not present at baseline, but developed de novo in nonmaturing AVFs.; Copyright © 2011 National Kidney Foundation, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background and Aim: In spite of numerous interventions, the control of mineral disturbances remains poor in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients. Chronic kidney disease - mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) represent an important cause of mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between mineral and bone disorders (MBD) and their components impact on all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CDV) mortality and morbidity in chronic dialysis patients.; Methods: This prospective study was carried out in a cohort of 92 randomly selected patients with ESRF treated with hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). The data regarding demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded, including vascular disease (coronary, cerebral, peripheral). The follow-up lasted 40 months and the final evaluation included the number and causes of deaths, CDV events and disease. Serum Ca, P, ALP, iPTH, albumin, cholesterol, urea and creatinine levels were measured. The plain radiographic films of hands and pelvis evaluated all bone abnormalities suggestive of renal osteodystrophy (ROD) and peripheral vascular calcification (VC).; Results: All-cause annual mortality represented 9.25% in HD and 9.09% in PD patients. The CDV mortality represented almost 44% in HD patients and 66% in PD patients from all deaths. There was a high prevalence of CDV diseases and events. High and low serum P levels were associated with a worse survival rate. Hypercalcaemia was associated with high risk for CDV events in HD patients. In PD patients, the relationship between increased ALP levels and all-cause mortality was significant. Other mineral markers were not predictive of the outcome in the studied patients. In the HD patients the severity of VC was associated with all-cause and CDV mortality, and with CDV events. Male gender, hypercholesterolemia, decreased URR, albumin and creatinine were identified as risk factors for all-cause mortality. The diabetics had higher death rates. Low dialysis efficacy represented a risk factor for mortality and CDV diseases and events. In PD patients, low albumin induced a higher death rate. In PD patients the death rate was similar to HD patients.; Conclusion: All-cause mortality was higher than in general population, but lower than the chronic dialysis patients' mortality reported in other studies. The death rates in HD and PD patients were similar. VC and serum P levels influenced the outcome in the HD patients - increased the risk for all-cause and CDV mortality, but also for CDV events. ALP levels influenced outcome in PD patients. There were no significant differences between HD and PD patients regarding outcome.;

AB  - Background and Objectives: The relationship between mineral metabolism disorders, bone fractures and vascular calcifications in kidney transplant recipients has not been established.; Method: We performed a cross-sectional study in 727 stable recipients from 28 Spanish transplant clinics. Mineral metabolism parameters, the semi-quantification of vertebral fractures and abdominal aortic calcifications were determined centrally.; Results: Vitamin D deficiency (25OHD3<15ng/ml) was more common in female recipients at CKD-T stages I-III (29.6% vs 44.4%; p=0.003). The inverse and significant correlation between 25OHD3 and PTH was gender-specific and women exhibited a steeper slope than men (p=0.01). Vertebral fractures (VFx) with deformity grade ≥2 were observed in 15% of recipients. Factors related to VFx differed by gender; in males, age (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.06) and CsA treatment (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.6-6.3); in females, age (OR 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03-1.12) and PTH levels (OR per 100pg/ml increase: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.043-1.542). Abdominal aortic calcifications were common (67.2%) and related to classical risk factors but not to mineral metabolism parameters.; Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is more common among female kidney transplant recipients at earlier CKD-T stages, and it contributes to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Prevalent vertebral fractures are only related to high serum PTH levels in female recipients.; Copyright © 2016 Sociedad Española de Nefrología. Published by Elsevier España, S.L.U.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether mitral valve or anulus calcification (MC) in patients with end-stage renal disease is associated with abnormalities of left ventricular (LV) structure and function, cardiac characteristics of 55 patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with (n = 26; age: 59 +/- 10 years) vs without (n = 29; age: 58 +/- 12 years) MC were analyzed using echocardiography and Doppler echocardiography. Sclerosis of the mitral valve anulus was detected in 18 (7 women, 11 men; age: 58 +/- 10 years) patients, sclerosis of mitral valve leaflets in 24 (13 women, 9 men; age: 59 +/- 10 years) patients. Patients with MC had higher systolic arterial blood pressure before initiation of dialysis therapy (191/104 mm Hg vs 173/94 mm Hg; p < 0.05) and higher calcium-phosphorus products (55 +/- 13 vs 42 +/- 16; p < 0.05) during CAPD therapy than those without MC. Neither prevalence nor severity of MC was related to dialysis duration or patient age. Systolic LV function was reduced (ejection fraction: 58 +/- 12 percent vs 65 +/- 13 percent; p < 0.05) and LV end-diastolic diameters were dilated (54 +/- 5 vs 50 +/- 8 mm; p < 0.05) in patients with MC. Left atrial dilatation (73 percent vs 31 percent; p < 0.005) and mitral valve regurgitation (65 percent vs 21 percent; p < 0.001) were more frequent in patients with vs those without MC. Excluding patients with significant mitral regurgitation from pulsed Doppler analysis, diastolic LV function was comparably impaired in patients with vs those without MC (maximal early/atrial filling velocity ratio: 0.77 +/- 0.25 vs 0.75 +/- 0.22; atrial filling fraction: 47 +/- 10 percent vs 48 +/- 11 percent; p = NS). The presented data suggest that MC follows long-standing and severe arterial hypertension before start of dialysis therapy. Therefore, effective blood pressure control in the predialysis period may be a tool to prevent these lesions. MC has clinical significance as a marker of LV dilatation and reduced LV systolic function in patients with chronic CAPD.;

AB  - Background: The Treat-to-Goal Study found that sevelamer slowed the progression of coronary calcification in patients on hemodialysis compared to calcium-based phosphate binders. To understand the implications of this effect for cardiovascular events, risk equations are needed.; Methods: Data on 179 patients on hemodialysis treated at one center in France included biochemical values during the year prior to study entry, patient characteristics, and cardiovascular events over an average of 4 years. As arterial calcification was evaluated ultrasonographically and quantified using a 0 to 4 score, an equation relating this to the electron-beam tomography (EBT)-based calcification score used in the trial was developed and applied to all patients. The estimated scores were then used in survival and Cox proportional hazards analyses of cardiovascular events in relation to the degree of calcification, controlling for other characteristics.; Results: Mean age at inclusion was 54 years, dialysis vintage 70 months, average follow-up 49 months; 32% suffered an event. The calcification score, diabetes, C-reactive protein (CRP), diastolic blood pressure, gender, smoking and hypertension are independent predictors of cardiovascular risk. The resulting equation indicates that, relative to a calcification score below 400, the risk of an initial event increases 44% for a score of 600, and more than doubles for a score of 1000.; Conclusion: In the absence of long-term follow-up studies, these equations permit quantification of the expected long-term clinical consequences of the impact of various phosphate binders on vascular calcification. Together with resource use and cost information, these equations are key inputs for formal cost-effectiveness analyses.;

AB  - The nature of arterial changes resulting in cardiovascular events and dialysis vascular access failures in adult predialysis patients is not well known. This study examined intimal changes, calcium deposition, and consequent stiffness in brachial and radial arteries of adult CKD patients. Ten brachial-artery and seven radial-artery specimens were obtained during fistula creation from nine predialysis and eight dialysis-dependent, nondiabetic patients; and age-gender matched controls undergoing coronary bypass grafts (6 radial) or kidney donation (6 renal). Arterial stiffness was measured at baseline. Vessel histology, morphometric analysis of intima-media, and direct quantification of calcium load was performed using standard techniques. Both predialysis and dialysis patients demonstrated significant arterial intimal hyperplasia with intima:media ratio higher than controls (0.13 ± 0.12 vs. 0.02 ± 0.05, p = 0.01). Calcium deposition was demonstrated on histology and the calcium content in patients was higher than controls (34.68 ± 26.86 vs. 10.95 ± 9.18 μg/μg, p = 0.003). The blood vessel calcium content correlated with arterial stiffness (r = 0.64, p = 0.018). This study for the first time describes, and suggests mechanistic linkage between, intimal hyperplasia, pathological calcium deposition, and increased functional arterial stiffness in dialysis and predialysis patients. Our research could serve as a unique window into the in vivo status of the uremic vasculature impacting fistula maturation and cardiovascular disease.; © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) can be a fatal complication in dialysis patients. Intradialytic hypotension is usually the precipitating factor. The occurrence of 16 cases in 5 years (1998-2002), compared with only 4 in previous years, led us to investigate other risk factors contributing to NOMI. A control group of stable hemodialysis patients was used for comparison.; Results: 20 patients were studied: 17 diagnosed surgically, and 3 clinically. The mean age was 70.8 +/- 1.8 years, and the male:female ratio 7:13. Nineteen patients were on hemodialysis. Clinically overt atherosclerosis was present in 17 patients. Preceding dialysis-associated hypotension was identified in all patients studied and access thrombosis in 6 patients. In all patients, abdominal pain was the presenting symptom. Initial abdominal examination was unimpressive in 16 patients. The hemoconcentration, leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis were the most prominent laboratory findings. 5/11 abdominal sonograms showed intestinal pathology. 2/3 angiographies were diagnostic. Three patients responded to early fluid challenge and did not require surgery. Pathology was related to the area of the superior mesenteric artery in all 15 patients operated. Twelve (60%) patients died from the event. The 1-year mortality rate was 17/20 patients (85%). Possible contributing factors, other than dialysis-associated hypotension, included: high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) therapy (179 +/- 35 vs. 116 +/- 10 U/kg/week in the control group, p < 0.05); metastatic calcifications (abdominal aorta 14/14, aortic valve 11/18; medial calcification of mesenteric arteries in 2/11 pathology specimens); digoxin, and hypoalbuminemia.; Conclusions: The increased incidence of NOMI in dialysis patients may be related to overly aggressive rhEPO therapy and the unsuspected presence of mesenteric arterial medial calcifications. Identification of patients at risk, prevention of intradialytic hypotension and a controlled increase in dry weight may help to reduce the incidence of NOMI in chronically dialyzed patients.; Copyright 2005 S.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: To establish the normal criterion of ascending aortic diameter (AAOD) measured by 64 multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and electron beam computed tomography (EBT) based on gender and age.; Materials and Methods: A total of 1442 consecutive subjects who were referred for evaluation of possible coronary artery disease underwent coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography (CTA) and coronary artery calcium scanning (CACS) (55 + 11 years, 65% male) without known coronary heart disease, hypertension, chronic pulmonary and renal disease, diabetes, and severe aortic calcification. The AAOD aortic diameter, descending aortic diameter (DAOD), pulmonary artery (PAD), and chest anteroposterior diameter (CAPD), posterior border of the sternal bone to the anterior border of the spine, were measured at the slice level of mid-right pulmonary artery using end systolic trigger imaging. The volume of four chambers, ejection fraction of left ventricle, and cardiac output were measured in 56% of the patients. Patients' demographic information, age, gender, weight, height, and body surface area were recorded. The mean value and age-specific and gender-adjusted upper normal limits (mean +/- 2 standard deviation) were calculated. The linear correlation analysis was done between AAOD and all parameters. The reproducibility, wall thickness, and difference between end-systole and end-diastole were calculated.; Results: AAOD has significant linear association with age, gender, DAOD, and pulmonary artery diameter (P < .05). There is no significant correlation between AAOD and body surface area, four-chamber volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, and CAPD. The mean intraluminal AAOD was 31.1 +/- 3.9 and 33.6 +/- 4.1 mm in females and males, respectively. The upper normal limits (mean +/- 2 standard deviations) of intraluminal AAOD, were 35.6, 38.3, and 40 mm for females and 37.8, 40.5, and 42.6 mm for males in age groups 20-40, 41-60, and older than 60 years, respectively. Intraluminal aortic diameters should parallel echocardiography and invasive angiography. Traditional cross-sectional imaging (with CT and magnetic resonance imaging) includes the vessel wall. The mean total AAOD was 33.5 and 36.0 mm in females and males, respectively. The upper normal limits (mean +/- 2 standard deviations) of intraluminal AAOD were 38.0, 40.7 and 42.4 mm for females and 40.2, 42.9, and 45.0 mm for males in age group 20 to 40, 41 to 60, and older than 60 years, respectively. The inter- and intraobserver, scanner, and repeated measurement variabilities were low (r value >0.91, P < .001, coefficient variation <3.2%). AAOD was 1.7 mm smaller in end-diastole than end-systole (P < .001).; Conclusions: The AAOD increases with age and male gender. Gender-specific and age-adjusted normal values for aortic diameters are necessary to differentiate pathologic atherosclerotic changes in the ascending aorta. Use of intraluminal or total aortic diameter values depends on the comparison study employed.;

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular events (CVE) are more prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) than in general population, being the main cause of morbimortality. Specific risk factors related to CKD have been suggested, because traditional factors do not fully explain this increase in cardiovascular disease rates. However, the role of atheromatosis, its pathogenesis and evolution are still unclear. The potential use of diagnostic tests to detect subclinical atheromatosis has to be determined.; Methods: NEFRONA is a prospective multicenter cohort study. 2445 CKD subjects were enrolled from 81 Spanish hospitals and dialysis clinics, from 2010 to 2012. Eligibility criteria included: 18 to 74 years old, CKD stage 3 or higher, and no previous CVE. 559 non-CKD controls were also recruited. Demographical, clinical and analytical data were collected. Carotid and femoral ultrasounds were performed by a single trained team to measure carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and detect atheromatous plaques. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured.; Results: Differences in age, sex and prevalence and control of cardiovascular risk factors were found between controls and CKD patients. These differences are similar to those described in epidemiological studies.No difference was found regarding cIMT between controls and CKD (when subjects with plaques in common carotid arteries were omitted); earlier CKD stages had higher values. CKD patients had a higher rate of atheromatous plaques, with no difference between stages in the unadjusted analysis. A group of patients had plaques in femoral arteries but were plaque-free in carotid arteries, and would have gone underdiagnosed without the femoral study. The percentage of pathologic ABI was higher in CKD, with higher prevalence in more advanced stages, and a higher rate of ABI >1.4 than <0.9, suggesting more vascular calcification.; Conclusions: NEFRONA is the first large study describing the actual prevalence of subclinical atheromatosis across different CKD stages. There is a very high rate of atheromatous plaques and pathologic ABI in CKD. Prospective data will add important information to the pathogenesis and evolution of atheromatosis in CKD, compared to non-CKD subjects.;

AB  - Objective: In a retrospective study, we compared two groups of consecutive patients operated by the same team during the year 2000 for coronary artery disease with the use of extracorporeal circulation (group 1, n=230) or on the beating heart using the Octopus II plus stabiliser (group 2, n=228). High-risk patients were identified by a EuroSCORE plus 6. EuroSCORE definitions and predicted risk models were utilized to compare the variables of the groups.; Methods: There were no significant differences between the preoperative variables of the groups in age, gender, left ventricular function, diabetes and peripheral vascular and renal disease as is indicated by the Euroscore (resp. 4.7/5.1 p=0.107). Calcification of the ascending aorta and chronic obstructive lung disease were statistically significant more prevalent in the beating heart group. No differences in preoperative variables in the high-risk patients group (Euroscore 8.5/8.1 p=0.356) except for calcification of the ascending aorta.; Results: All patients underwent a full revascularisation through a midline sternotomy. Significant more distal anastomoses were performed in group 1 (3.7 per patient (1-6)) with regard to group 2 (2.9 per patient (1-6)). Anesthesia, postoperative treatment and follow up were equal for both groups. A significant lower incidence of atrial fibrillation (p=0.010), shorter ICU stay (p=0.031) and renal insufficiency (p=0.033) was reported in group 2. In the low risk group, we could not diagnose any difference between the two groups, except for atrial fibrillation. The benefits of the beating heart surgery however were more pronounced in the high-risk patient as is indicated by a significant reduction of the ICU stay by 1 day (3.5d/2.5d (p=0.028)), better preservation of the renal function (p=0.017) and a significant reduction of the length of hospital stay by more than two days (p=0.040). A lower incidence of atrial fibrillation, however not significant.; Conclusion: In our experience, beating heart surgery is a safe alternative for conventional coronary heart surgery. High-risk patients do benefit most from this technique. It became our first choice in the elderly patient and patients presenting with higher co-morbidities.;

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the coronary Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) to prepare severely calcified lesions for stent deployment in patients grouped by renal function.; Background: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of severely calcified lesions is associated with increased rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including death, myocardial infarction (MI), and target vessel revascularization (TVR) compared with PCI of non-calcified vessels. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk for MACE after PCI. The impact of CKD on coronary orbital atherectomy treatment has not been well characterized.; Methods: ORBIT II was a prospective, multicenter trial in the U.S., which enrolled 443 patients with severely calcified coronary lesions. The MACE rate was defined as a composite of cardiac death, MI, and target vessel revascularization.; Results: Of the 441 patients enrolled with known estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values at baseline, 333 (75.5%) patients had eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 108 patients had eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 . The mean eGFR at baseline in the eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 groups was 65.0 ± 0.9 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 109.1 ± 2.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 , respectively. Freedom from MACE was lower in the eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 group at 30 days (87.4% vs. 96.3%, P = 0.02) and 1-year (80.6% vs. 90.7%, P = 0.02).; Conclusions: Patients with renal impairment had a higher MACE rate through one year follow-up due to a higher rate of periprocedural MI. Interestingly, the rates of cardiac death and revascularization through 1-year were similar in patients with eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 . Future studies are needed to identify the ideal revascularization strategy for patients with renal impairment and severely calcified coronary lesions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.; © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), sclerostin and DKK1 constitute opposite bone turnover inhibitors, OPG inhibiting osteoclastogenesis while sclerostin and DKK1 exerting their inhibitory effects on osteoblastogenesis. Both proteins have been recognized as strong risk factors of vascular calcifications in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between these inhibitors and coronary artery calcifications (CAC) in this population.; Methods: A total of 241 ND-CKD patients [143 males; 69.0 (25.0-95.0) years; median estimated glomerular filtration rate using CKD-EPI 35.1 (6.7-120.1) mL/min/1.73 m(2)] were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. All underwent chest multidetector computed tomography for CAC scoring. OPG, sclerostin, DKK1 and mineral metabolism markers including PTH and bone alkaline phosphatase were measured. Logistic regression analyses were used to study the relationships between CAC and these markers.; Results: Decline in renal function was associated with a significant increase in OPG and sclerostin while a slight but significant decrease in DKK1 was observed. The main crude associations with presence of CAC were a high level of OPG [OR = 2.55 95% confidence interval (95% CI) (1.35-4.82) for a level ranging from 6.26 to 9.15 pmol/L and OR = 5.74 95% CI (2.87-11.5) for a level ≥9.15 pmol/L; P < 0.0001] and a high level of sclerostin [OR = 2.64 95% CI (1.39-5.00) for a level ranging from 0.748 to 1.139 ng/mL and OR = 3.78 95% CI (1.96-7.31) for a level ≥1.139 ng/mL; P = 0.0002]. A logistic regression model clearly showed that the risk to present CAC was significantly increased when both OPG (≥6.26 pmol/L) and sclerostin (≥0.748 ng/mL) levels were high [crude model: OR = 11.47 95% CI (4.54-29.0); P < 0.0001; model adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, body mass index and smoking habits: OR = 5.69 95% CI (1.76-18.4); P = 0.02]. No association between DKK1 and presence of CAC was observed.; Conclusions: Our results strongly suggest that bone turnover inhibitors, OPG and sclerostin, are independently associated with CAC with potential additive effects in ND-CKD patients.; © The Author 2015.

AB  - Objective: We assess the angiographic and clinical outcomes of patients with a history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery who underwent orbital atherectomy for the treatment of severely calcified coronary lesions.; Background: The presence of severe coronary artery calcification (CAC) increases the complexity of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Patients with a history of CABG who undergo PCI often have comorbidities and are at higher risk for ischemic complications.; Methods: Of the 458 patients who underwent orbital atherectomy, 77 patients (17%) had a history of CABG and 381 (83%) did not. The primary endpoint was rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), comprised of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), target-vessel revascularization (TVR), and stroke.; Results: The CABG group had a higher prevalence of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, history of PCI, and unstable angina. The primary endpoint was similar in the CABG and non-CABG groups (1% vs 2%; P=.56), as were the individual endpoints of cardiac death (0% vs 2%; P=.27), MI (1% vs 1%; P=.85), TVR (0% vs 0%; P>.99), and stroke (0% vs 0%; P=.65). The rates of angiographic complications and stent thrombosis were similarly low in both groups.; Conclusion: Despite a higher-risk baseline profile, patients with a history of CABG had similar angiographic and clinical outcomes compared with patients who had no previous history of CABG. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of orbital atherectomy in these patients.;

AB  - Objectives: This study analyzed the outcomes of patients who presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and subsequently underwent orbital atherectomy for severe coronary artery calcification (CAC).; Background: Patients who present with NSTEMI have increased risk for death and recurrent MI after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with severe CAC have worse outcomes after PCI.Orbital atherectomy modifies calcified plaque, facilitating stent delivery and optimizing stent expansion. There are no data on these patients who present with NSTEMI who undergo orbital atherectomy.; Methods: Of the 454 consecutive real-world patients who underwent orbital atherectomy in our retrospective multicenter registry, 51 patients (11.2%) presented with NSTEMI. The primary safety endpoint was the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 30days.; Results: Patients with NSTEMI had a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease, lower mean ejection fraction, and required more vessels to be treated. The primary endpoint was similar in patients who presented with and without NSTEMI (2.0% vs. 2.2%, p=0.9), as were the 30-day rates of death (2.0% vs. 1.2%, p=0.67), MI (0% vs. 1.2%, p=0.42), target vessel revascularization (0% vs. 0%, p>0.91), and stroke (0% vs. 0.2%, p=0.72). The rates of angiographic complications and stent thrombosis rate were low in both groups.; Conclusions: Despite having worse baseline characteristics, patients who presented with NSTEMI and subsequently underwent orbital atherectomy had similar clinical outcomes compared with patients without NSTEMI.; Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background and Aims: Serum malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) and MDA-LDL/LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) ratio are risk factors for arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, no information is available on these parameters or their associations with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in haemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods and Results: Fifty-seven HD patients and 26 control subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. Serum MDA-LDL concentrations and MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratios were examined. HD patients had significantly higher MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratios than the controls (105.1 ± 27.5 vs. 81.4 ± 18.9 mU/mg, P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference in serum MDA-LDL levels between the 2 groups. CAC scores were examined only in HD patients and their possible associations with the clinical/laboratory data were analysed. Analysis of HD patients showed that MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio has an association with presence of CVD, CAC score, HD duration, MDA-LDL, or haemoglobin A1C. In addition, the CAC score was positively correlated with serum MDA-LDL level (P = 0.048) and MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio (P = 0.006). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio (β = 0.04, P = 0.003) and HD duration (β = 0.16, P = 0.007) were independently associated with CAC score.; Conclusion: The MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio of HD patients was significantly higher than that of non-HD subjects and was independently associated with the CAC score. Therefore, this ratio could be an important risk factor for CAC in HD patients.; Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the parathyroid ultrasonography and define parameters that can predict poor response to treatment in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to renal failure.; Methods: This cohort study evaluated 85 patients with chronic kidney disease stage V with parathyroid hormone levels above 800 pg/mL. All patients underwent ultrasonography of the parathyroids and the following parameters were analyzed: Demographic characteristics (etiology of chronic kidney disease, gender, age, dialysis vintage, vascular access, use of vitamin D), laboratory (calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, bone alkaline phosphatase), and the occurrence of bone changes, cardiovascular events and death. The χ(2) test were used to compare proportions or the Fisher exact test for small sample frequencies. Student t-test was used to detect differences between the two groups regarding continuous variables.; Results: Fifty-three patients (66.4%) had parathyroid nodules with higher levels of parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphorus. Sixteen patients underwent parathyroidectomy and had higher levels of phosphorus and calcium × phosphorus product (P = 0.03 and P = 0.006, respectively). They also had lower mortality (32% vs 68%, P = 0.01) and lower incidence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (27% vs 73%, P = 0.02). Calcium × phosphorus product above 55 mg(2)/dL(2) [RR 1.48 (1.06, 2.08), P = 0.03], presence of vascular calcification [1.33 (1.01, 1.76), P = 0.015] and previous occurrence of vascular events [RR 2.25 (1.27, 3.98), P < 0.001] were risk factors for mortality in this population. There was no association between the occurrence of nodules and mortality.; Conclusion: The identification of nodules at ultrasonography strengthens the indication for parathyroidectomy in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to renal failure.;

AB  - Background: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with vascular calcification and arterial stiffness in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and cardiovascular function before and after parathyroidectomy (PTX) in maintenance hemodialysis patients.; Methods: We compared predialytic and intradialytic blood pressure, left and right ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF and RVEF), and cardiothoracic ratio 1 month before PTX, and 6 and 12 months after PTX. IDH was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥ 20 mmHg or a decrease in mean arterial pressure ≥ 10 mmHg.; Results: At the time of PTX, the mean age of the patients was 57.4 ± 12.0 years, and the mean dialysis vintage was 12.2 ± 5.8 years. At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after PTX, the average numbers of sessions disturbed by IDH during 13 dialysis sessions (1 month) were 6.4, 3.9 (p < 0.016 vs. baseline), and 4.0 sessions (p < 0.037 vs. baseline, p = 0.801 vs. 6 months), respectively. LVEF and RVEF were improved significantly after PTX. Furthermore, volume status was also improved, as evidenced by the significantly greater ultrafiltration volume and reduced cardiothoracic ratio.; Conclusions: Hemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism are more likely to achieve normotensive and euvolemic status after PTX, probably through improved heart function and reduced IDH episodes.; © 2013 S.

AB  - Purpose: Severe circumferential calcification of the outflow artery during lower-extremity distal revascularization is considered a poor prognostic factor for bypass graft patency. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of circumferential infrapopliteal arterial calcification on bypass graft patency and limb salvage rates, comparing patency and limb salvage rates in unclampable calcified distal outflow arteries with those observed in uncalcified distal outflow arteries.; Methods: From July 1990 to July 1997, of 441 distal bypass graft procedures performed by the same surgeon, 69 (16%, group I) involved unclampable calcified outflow vessels, whereas 83 (19%, group II) outflow vessels were uncalcified; the other 289 (65%) had varying intermediate degrees of calcification and were not included in this analysis. All procedures were performed for limb-threatening ischemia and involved standard vein patch angioplasty of the distal anastomotic site, irrespective of the conduit used. Primary and secondary patency, limb salvage, and survival rates were assessed by using Kaplan-Meier analysis.; Results: Groups were similar with regard to age, sex, and atherosclerotic risk factors except for a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (88% vs 65%, P =.001) and renal failure (17% vs 5%, P =.01), including dialysis dependency (P =.01) in group I. Gangrene as an indication for surgery was statistically more frequent in group I (49% vs 29%, P =.01). The distal anastomotic locations and types of conduit involved were similar in the two groups. The femoral inflow level was used more often in group II (63% vs 38%, P =.003), the popliteal in group I (32% vs 17%, P =.03). Follow-up ranged from 30 days to 144 months, with a mean of 69 months. None of the patients were lost during the follow-up period. None of the patients died during the perioperative (30-day) period. Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 84%, 65%, and 52% for group I and 89%, 76%, and 69% for group II (P =.07.). Secondary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 96%, 82%, and 78% for group I and 96%, 85%, and 82% for group II (P =.58). Limb salvage rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 93%, 83%, and 81% for group I and 97%, 90%, and 86% for group II (P =.39).; Conclusions: Distal revascularization to unclampable, severely calcified outflow arteries can achieve much the same results to those obtained in uncalcified outflow arteries. A circumferentially calcified distal recipient artery should not be considered a major obstacle to an attempt at limb salvage bypass graft surgery.;

AB  - Calcific uremic arteriolopathy, also known as calciphylaxis, is a rare syndrome of small vessel calcification of unknown etiology causing painful, violaceous skin lesions that progress to form chronic non-healing ulcers and gangrene. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can be used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of these ulcers. However, due to paucity of cases, there is limited data on the clinical benefit of HBOT and identifying factors associated with healing. The purpose of this study was to determine patient outcomes and factors associated with healing in patients with calciphylaxis undergoing HBOT. A retrospective chart review was completed on patients who were diagnosed with calciphylaxis and had hyperbaric medicine consultation between May 2012 and January 2016. Clinical outcomes, demographics, risk factors, laboratory values, wound distribution, and HBOT profiles were collected and analyzed. We identified 8 patients. Out of 8 patients consulted for calciphylaxis, five were consented and underwent HBOT (2 males and 3 females). All had coexisting ESRD and Diabetes. All males were able to tolerate being in the chamber and received therapeutic treatments (at least 20 HBOT) with complete resolution of ulcers. HBOT was discontinued in one female due to an inconsistent biopsy report and two others due to death secondary to septic shock or respiratory arrest and severe uremia. Calciphylaxis is a devastating disease with a high mortality rate. Our results demonstrated a positive response to HBOT especially when receiving at least 20 treatments. A majority of calciphylaxis cases are females and indeed female gender has been cited as a risk factor for this disease. However, current literature has not conferred a relationship between gender nor the number of HBOT received and outcomes. Our results showed that males had a more favorable outcome provided they received at least twenty HBOT. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate these outcomes.;

AB  - Pericardial fat (PF) a component of visceral adipose tissue has been consistently related to coronary atherosclerosis in the general population. This study evaluated the association between PF and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This is a post-hoc cross sectional analysis of the baseline of a prospective cohort of 117 outward CKD patients without manifest coronary artery disease (age, 56.9 ± 11.0 years, 64.1% males, 95.1% hypertensives, 25.2% diabetics, 15.5% ever smokers, CKD stage 2 to 5 with estimated glomerular filtration rate 36.8 ± 18.1 ml/min). CAC scores, PF volume and abdominal visceral fat (AVF) areas were measured by computed tomography. The association of PF as a continuous variable with the presence of CAC was analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. CAC (calcium score > 0) was present in 59.2% patients. Those presenting CAC were on average 10 years older, had a higher proportion of male gender (78.7% vs. 42.9%, p < 0.001), and had higher values of waist circumference (95.9 ± 10.7 vs. 90.2 ± 13.2 cm, p = 0.02), PF volumes (224.8 ± 107.6 vs. 139.1 ± 85.0 cm3, p<0.01) and AVF areas (109.2 ± 81.5 vs. 70.2 ± 62.9 cm2, p = 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking and, left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, PF was significantly associated with the presence of CAC (OR: 1.88 95% CI: 1.03-3.43 per standard deviation). PF remained associated with CAC even with additional adjustments for estimated glomerular filtration rate or serum phosphorus (OR: 1.85 95% CI: 1.00-3.42, p = 0.05). PF is independently associated with CAC in non-dialysis dependent CKD patients.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcifications (VCs) are frequently observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients. They have been associated with numerous factors, particularly hyperphosphataemia, excess calcium load, hypertension and increased mortality rate. The purpose of this study is to measure VCs in long-HD patients with good blood pressure and phosphate control, with the occasional use of sevelamer, using a plain radiological score to identify the associated factors and effects on the 1-year survival rate.; Methods: We studied HD patients from one centre using a semi-quantitative score ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity and extent of VCs. The following patients' characteristics were compared according to their VC scores: medical history, treatments, blood pressure, standard biological data, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), whole PTH, beta-crosslaps, bone alkaline phosphatases and bone mineral density scores. One-year survival analyses were also performed.; Results: Among the 250 HD patients of the centre, 161 were studied; the mean age was 67.2 +/- 13 years, 45% of the subjects were females, 35% were diabetics, and they had been on dialysis for between 1-486 months (median: 45 months) with a 3 x 5-3 x 8 h dialysis schedule using 1.5 mmol/l dialysate calcium and providing a mean 2.25 +/- 0.5 Kt/V. Only 17% of the patients were free from VCs and 11% had severe VCs. The factors associated with VCs were classified into 'classic' (age, diabetes, male gender, tobacco use, inflammation, more frequent warfarin treatment and peripheral vascular and cardiac diseases) and 'non-traditional' (higher FGF-23 and OPG serum levels, low albumin serum levels and low alfacalcidol and CaCO(3) use). In logistic regression, only age, diabetes and FGF-23 serum levels were associated with VC scores of 2 and 3. The patients with a score of 3 had a higher 1-year mortality rate (RR 2.1; P = 0.01) as compared to patients with a 0 score.; Conclusion: A plain radiological score showed the high prevalence (83%) of VCs in HD patients in spite of a long and intensive dialysis strategy and adherence to guidelines. The main associated factors were classic factors such as ageing and diabetes. No relationship was found with blood pressure and phosphataemia that remained well controlled in long dialysis; the association with FGF-23 serum levels may aggregate some non-traditional risk factors. The harmful effects of VCs on survival require their systematic assessment and optimization of the potentially modifiable associated factors in CKD and HD patients.;

AB  - Background: Serum phosphorus (P) and the product of serum calcium x serum P (Ca x P), are frequently elevated in end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Elevated P and Ca x P have been associated with vascular calcification in dialysis patients.; Objective: [corrected] To examine the role of P and Ca x P as risk factors for incident peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in HD patients with pre-existing CVD.; Methods: This nested case-control study is drawn from the 11 incident PVD events reported in the cohort of the Secondary prevention with antioxidants of cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease (SPACE): a randomized placebo-controlled trial. PVD was defined clinically and confirmed ultrasonographically. Each individual with a PVD event was matched for SPACE treatment group (vitamin E or placebo), age (in 4-year categories) and gender with two individuals who had no CVD end point during the follow-up period.; Results: Serum P and Ca x P levels were significantly higher in PVD patients than in controls. In univariate logistic regression analysis, only serum P predicted PVD in this population (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.07 - 3.81, p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, adjustment was made for variables dissimilar by PVD status including underlying renal disease, diabetes, smoking, history of angina pectoris, prescription for vitamin D3, erythropoietin, calcium channel blockers and aspirin. In this model, serum P remained the only significant predictor of incident PVD (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.01 - 5.74, p = 0.04).; Conclusions: Findings of the present study are consistent with a role for serum P and Ca x P in the pathogenesis of PVD in HD patients.;

AB  - Chronic kidney disease--mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex syndrome influenced by various factors, such as age, CKD etiology, uremic toxins, and dialysis modality. Although extensively studied in hemodialysis (HD) patients, only a few studies exist for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Since most of these older studies contain no bone biopsy data, we studied the pattern of renal osteodystrophy in 41 prevalent PD patients. The most common presentation was adynamic bone disease (49%). There was a significant inverse association between serum sclerostin (a Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor that decreases osteoblast action and bone formation) and the bone formation rate. Bone alkaline phosphatase had the best sensitivity and specificity to detect both high- and low-turnover diseases. The comparison between nondiabetic PD and HD patients, matched by age, gender, parathyroid hormone level, and length of dialysis, revealed low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, worse bone mineralization, and low bone turnover in the nondiabetic PD group. Thus, adynamic bone disease was the most frequent type of renal osteodystrophy in PD patients. Sclerostin seems to participate in the pathophysiology of adynamic bone disease and bone alkaline phosphatase was the best serum marker of bone turnover in these patients.;

AB  - Background and Aims: Calcium-containing phosphate binders have been shown to increase the progression of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. This is a prospective study that compares the effects of calcium acetate and sevelamer on coronary calcification (CAC) and bone histology.; Methods: 101 hemodialysis patients were randomized for each phosphate binder and submitted to multislice coronary tomographies and bone biopsies at entry and 12 months.; Results: The 71 patients who concluded the study had similar baseline characteristics. On follow-up, the sevelamer group had higher levels of intact parathyroid hormone (498 +/- 352 vs. 326 +/- 236 pg/ml, p = 0.017), bone alkaline phosphatase (38 +/- 24 vs. 28 +/- 15 U/l, p = 0.03) and deoxypyridinoline (135 +/- 107 vs. 89 +/- 71 nmol/l, p = 0.03) and lower LDL cholesterol (74 +/- 21 vs. 91 +/- 28 mg/dl, p = 0.015). Phosphorus (5.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 6 +/- 1.0 mg/dl, p = 0.47) and calcium (1.27 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.23 +/- 0.08 mmol/l, p = 0.68) levels did not differ between groups. CAC progression (35 vs. 24%, p = 0.94) and bone histological diagnosis at baseline and 12 months were similar in both groups. Patients of the sevelamer group with a high turnover at baseline had an increase in bone resorption (eroded surface, ES/BS = 9.0 +/- 5.9 vs. 13.1 +/- 9.5%, p = 0.05), whereas patients of both groups with low turnover at baseline had an improvement in bone formation rate (BFR/BS = 0.015 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.062 +/- 0.078, p = 0.003 for calcium and 0.017 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.071 +/- 0.084 microm(3)/microm(2)/day, p = 0.010 for sevelamer).; Conclusions: There was no difference in CAC progression or changes in bone remodeling between the calcium and the sevelamer groups.; (c) 2008 S.

AB  - Background: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a phosphaturic hormone implicated in disorders of serum phosphorus concentration and vitamin D. The role of FGF23 in vascular calcification remains controversial.; Methods: Relationships between FGF23 and coronary artery calcified atherosclerotic plaque (CAC), aortoiliac calcified plaque (CP), carotid artery CP, volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), albuminuria, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were determined in 545 African Americans with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and preserved kidney function in African American-Diabetes Heart Study participants. Generalized linear models were fitted to test associations between FGF23 and cardiovascular, bone, and renal phenotypes, and change in measurements over time, adjusting for age, gender, African ancestry proportion, body mass index, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors, statins, calcium supplements, serum calcium, and serum phosphate.; Results: The sample was 56.7% female with a mean (SD) age of 55.6 (9.6) years, diabetes duration of 10.3 (8.2) years, eGFR 90.9 (22.1) ml/min/1.73 m2, urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) 151 (588) (median 13) mg/g, plasma FGF23 161 (157) RU/ml, and CAC 637 (1,179) mg. In fully adjusted models, FGF23 was negatively associated with eGFR (p < 0.0001) and positively associated with UACR (p < 0.0001) and CAC (p = 0.0006), but not with carotid CP or aortic CP. Baseline FGF23 concentration did not associate with changes in vBMD or CAC after a mean of 5.1 years follow-up.; Conclusions: Plasma FGF23 concentrations were independently associated with subclinical coronary artery disease, albuminuria, and kidney function in the understudied African American population with T2D. Findings support relationships between FGF23 and vascular calcification, but not between FGF23 and bone mineral density, in African Americans lacking advanced nephropathy.; © 2016 S.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has been suggested to play a role in vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) assessment and common carotid artery (CCA) plaque identification using ultrasound are well-recognized tools for identification and monitoring of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to test that elevated FGF-23 levels might be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this cross-sectional study, plasma FGF-23 concentrations were measured using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured and CCA plaques were identified by B-Mode Doppler ultrasound. One hundred twenty-eight maintenance HD patients (65 women and 63 men, mean age: 55.5 ± 13 years, mean HD vintage: 52 ± 10 months, all patients are on HD thrice a week) were involved. The mean CIMT were higher with increasing tertiles of plasma FGF-23 levels (0.66 ± 0.14 vs. 0.75 ± 0.05 vs. 0.86 ± 0.20 mm, P<0.0001). Log plasma FGF-23 were higher in patients with plaques in CCA than patients free of plaques (3.0 ± 0.17 vs. 2.7 ± 0.23, P<0.0001). Significant correlation was recorded between log plasma FGF-23 and CIMT (r=0,497, P=0.0001). In multiple regression analysis, a high log FGF-23 concentration was a significant independent risk factor of an increased CIMT. Further studies are needed to clarify whether an increased plasma FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential mechanism for atherosclerosis in patients with end-stage renal disease.; © 2010 The Author.

AB  - Background: Calciphylaxis is a syndrome consisting of vascular calcification, thrombosis, and skin necrosis. The syndrome develops often in chronic hemodialysis patients. However, there have been several case reports on calciphylaxis in patients with POEMS (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes) syndrome, a systemic disease associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).; Methods: In 76 POEMS patients and 86 age- and gender-matched disease controls, we studied abnormal small vessel calcification by computed tomography (CT) of the soft tissues. Clinical and laboratory profiles were compared between POEMS patients with and without calciphylaxis. Histological examination was performed in six autopsy cases.; Results: Small vessel calcification on CT was found in 17 % of POEMS patients and in none of the controls (P < 0.001). Autopsy confirmed calciphylaxis in 2 (33 %) patients. Among POEMS patients, higher disease activity, including more severe neuropathy and ascites, higher serum levels of interleukin-6, and lower serum albumin levels, was associated with the development of calciphylaxis. Serum levels of creatinine, calcium, and phosphate were not related to the presence of calciphylaxis.; Conclusions: Calciphylaxis is often present in patients with POEMS syndrome. Upregulation of multiple inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF and interleukin-6 may contribute to the development of calciphylaxis, by entirely different mechanism from that in chronic dialysis. POEMS syndrome should be recognized as a potential cause of calciphylaxis.;

AB  - Background: The strong correlation between vascular calcification and cardiovascular risk, which is a major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients, has been well established. Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular calcification, and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is produced at the site of inflammation, which is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main purpose of this study was evaluating the correlation between fetuin-A and PTX3 with some biochemical parameters effective upon vascular calcification in HD patients.; Methods: We included 84 HD patients and 84 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) in this study. Blood samples were drawn from all subjects and the serum levels of creatinine, urea, albumin, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), parathyroid hormone, fetuin-A, high sensitive C-reactive protein, and PTX3 were measured by biochemical methods.; Results: We found that the serum levels of PTX3, C-reactive protein (CRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, and P in the patient group were significantly higher than the control group but the serum levels of fetuin-A and albumin were significantly lower in the patient group. Also, fetuin-A had a significant correlation with high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) as well as duration of dialysis. In addition, it was shown that the correlation between PTX3 and PTH was significant only in the patient group.; Conclusion: In this study, increased PTX3 and decreased fetuin-A levels were observed in the HD patients. According to our results, these 2 parameters may potentially serve as suitable markers for inflammation and prediction of vascular complications in these patients.; 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Clinical outcomes of dialysis patients are variable, and improved knowledge of prognosis would inform decisions regarding patient management. We assessed the value of simple, chest X-ray derived measures of cardiac size (cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)) and vascular calcification (Aortic Arch Calcification (AAC)), in predicting death and improving multivariable prognostic models in a prevalent cohort of hemodialysis patients.; Methods: Eight hundred and twenty-four dialysis patients with one or more postero-anterior (PA) chest X-ray were included in the study. Using a validated calcification score, the AAC was graded from 0 to 3. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between AAC score, CTR, and mortality. AAC was treated as a categorical variable with 4 levels (0,1,2, or 3). Age, race, diabetes, and heart failure were adjusted for in the multivariable analysis. The criterion for statistical significance was p<0.05.; Results: The median CTR of the sample was 0.53 [IQR=0.48,0.58] with calcification scores as follows: 0 (54%), 1 (24%), 2 (17%), and 3 (5%). Of 824 patients, 152 (18%) died during follow-up. Age, sex, race, duration of dialysis, diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and baseline serum creatinine and phosphate were included in a base Cox model. Both CTR (HR 1.78[1.40,2.27] per 0.1 unit change), area under the curve (AUC)=0.60[0.55,0.65], and AAC (AAC 3 vs 0 HR 4.35[2.38,7.66], AAC 2 vs 0 HR 2.22[1.41,3.49], AAC 1 vs 0 HR 2.43[1.64,3.61]), AUC=0.63[0.58,0.68]) were associated with death in univariate Cox analysis. CTR remained significant after adjustment for base model variables (adjusted HR 1.46[1.11,1.92]), but did not increase the AUC of the base model (0.71[0.66,0.76] vs. 0.71[0.66,0.76]) and did not improve net reclassification performance (NRI=0). AAC also remained significant on multivariable analysis, but did not improve net reclassification (NRI=0). All ranges were based on 95% confidence intervals.; Conclusions: Neither CTR nor AAC assessed on chest x-ray improved prediction of mortality in this prevalent cohort of dialysis patients. Our data do not support the clinical utility of X-ray measures of cardiac size and vascular calcification for the purpose of mortality prediction in prevalent hemodialysis patients. More advanced imaging techniques may be needed to improve prognostication in this population.;

AB  - Purpose: To identify predictors of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) patency in Asian patients with autogenous radio-cephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVF).; Methods: Retrospective review of 436 RCAVFs created between 2009 and 2013. Predictors of patency were identified with univariate and multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were used to calculate patency rates.; Results: Overall secondary patency rate was 72% at 12 months, 69% at 24 months, 58% at 36 months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months. Univariate analysis showed that factors which predict for patency include male gender (p = 0.003), good diabetic control (p = 0.025), aspirin use (p = 0.031), pre-dialysis status (p = 0.037), radial artery diameter (p = 0.029) and non-calcified radial arteries (p = 0.002). Age (p = 0.866), cephalic vein diameter (p = 0.630) and surgeon grade (p = 0.472) did not predict for primary AVF failure. Multivariate analysis revealed the male gender to be an independent predictor for patency (odds ratio 1.99, p = 0.01). Subset analysis showed a significantly larger average radial artery diameter of 2.3 mm amongst males, as compared to 1.9 mm amongst females (p = 0.001) and no statistical difference in the average cephalic vein diameter.; Conclusions: Within our Asian study population, 12-month patency rate of RCAVF is 72%, 69% at 24 months, 58% at 36 months, 57% at 48 months, 56% at 60 months and 54% at 72 months. Male gender is an independent predictor for RCAVF patency. In females or patients with calcified radial arteries, a more proximal AVF should be considered.;

AB  - Vascular access micro-calcification is a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients but its influence on vascular access patency is still undetermined. Our study aimed to determine the impact of arterial micro-calcification (AMiC) on the patency of vascular access in HD patients. One-hundred fourteen HD patients receiving arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operation were included in this study. During the operation, we obtained partial arterial specimen and performed pathological examination by von Kossa stain to identify AMiC. We compared primary unassisted AVF failure within 1 year between positive and negative AMiC groups, and performed Cox regression analysis for evaluating risk factor of AVF failure. The incidence of AMiC was 37.7% and AVF failure occurred in 45 patients (39.5%). The AVF failure rate within 1 year was greater in the positive AMiC group than those in the negative AMiC group (53.5% vs. 31.0%, p = 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the positive AMiC group had a lower AVF patency rate than the negative AMiC group (p = 0.02). The presence of AMiC was an independent risk factor for AVF failure. In conclusion, preexisting AMiC of the vascular access is associated with primary unassisted AVF failure in incident HD patients.; © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) often fail to mature, but the mechanism of AVF nonmaturation is poorly understood. Arterial microcalcification is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may limit vascular dilatation, thereby contributing to early postoperative juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis and impaired AVF maturation. This study evaluated whether preexisting arterial microcalcification adversely affects AVF outcomes.; Study Design: Prospective study.; Setting& Participants: 127 patients with CKD undergoing AVF surgery at a large academic medical center.; Predictors: Preexisting arterial microcalcification (≥1% of media area) assessed independently by von Kossa stains of arterial specimens obtained during AVF surgery and by preoperative ultrasound.; Outcomes: Juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis (ascertained by ultrasound obtained 4-6 weeks postoperatively), AVF nonmaturation (inability to cannulate with 2 needles with dialysis blood flow ≥ 300mL/min for ≥6 sessions in 1 month within 6 months of AVF creation), and duration of primary unassisted AVF survival after successful use (time to first intervention).; Results: Arterial microcalcification was present by histologic evaluation in 40% of patients undergoing AVF surgery. The frequency of a postoperative juxta-anastomotic AVF stenosis was similar in patients with or without preexisting arterial microcalcification (32% vs 42%; OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.28-1.52; P=0.3). AVF nonmaturation was observed in 29%, 33%, 33%, and 33% of patients with <1%, 1% to 4.9%, 5% to 9.9%, and ≥10% arterial microcalcification, respectively (P=0.9). Sonographic arterial microcalcification was found in 39% of patients and was associated with histologic calcification (P=0.001), but did not predict AVF nonmaturation. Finally, among AVFs that matured, unassisted AVF maturation (time to first intervention) was similar for patients with and without preexisting arterial microcalcification (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21; P=0.2).; Limitations: Single-center study.; Conclusions: Arterial microcalcification is common in patients with advanced CKD, but does not explain postoperative AVF stenosis, AVF nonmaturation, or AVF failure after successful cannulation.; Copyright © 2015 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Objectives Optical coherence tomography chronic total occlusion catheter, the Ocelot (Avinger Inc., Redwood City, CA), has been utilized to cross Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D lesions. This study evaluated the preoperative computerized tomography angiography of chronic total occlusions in the superficial femoral artery to predict clinical success. Methods We reviewed all patients who underwent lower extremity procedures with the Ocelot catheter from June 2014 to August 2016. Patients who had a preoperative computerized tomography angiography were evaluated. Final outcomes, plaque morphology, lesion length, calcium surface area, lesion location, and patient characteristics were analyzed. Results A total of 107 patients underwent lower extremity interventions with the Ocelot catheter. Seventy patients had a preoperative computerized tomography angiography scan prior to lower extremity intervention and 77% (54) had Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D lesions that were crossed. Mean age was 62.8 years and 68.6% were male. Mean chronic total occlusion length was 182.7 mm (170.8 mm crossed vs. 222.6 mm uncrossed, p = 0.03). Calcium distribution differed significantly ( p<.01): circumferential (14.8 vs. 12.5%); eccentric (85 vs. 62.5%); and complete calcium occlusion (0 vs. 25%) for lesions that were crossed and uncrossed, respectively. Significant differences ( p<.0001) were found when calcium occlusion was less than 50% (87 vs. 31%), 51-75% (9.3 vs. 31.2%), and 76-100% (3.7 vs. 37.5%). Total calcium length in crossed lesion was 51.6 mm, and 92.8 mm in uncrossed lesions ( p = 0.10). No significant differences were noted for patient gender, occlusion location (proximal, middle, and distal superficial femoral artery), and kidney function. Conclusion The Ocelot catheter is an effective method to cross long Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D lesions. Superficial femoral artery lesions longer than 17 cm and focal plaque morphology, specifically a total cross-sectional area of calcium and a calcium surface area greater than 50% were most predictive of failure to cross Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus D superficial femoral artery lesions. Computerized tomography angiography is an effective tool to predict success for crossing chronic total occlusions using optical coherence tomography technology and a critical consideration for patient selection.;

AB  - The aim of our retrospective study was to evaluate the ultrasonographic mapping of both arm and forearm vessels before primary arteriovenous fistula (AVF) construction in elderly patients with end-stage renal disease. There were 129 patients aged 75 +/- 6 (65-93) years, 58% men, 37% diabetics, who participated in the study. The inner diameter of veins (under compression) and arteries, and the arterial peak systolic velocity (PSV) were measured. The presence of arterial calcifications was noted. The positions for possible native AVF construction (radiocephalic and brachiocephalic) were suggested and an AVF was constructed by a trained nephrologist. An adequate cephalic vein was present in 76 (59%) patients (diameter 4.9 +/- 1.1 mm) in the right arm, and in 83 (64%) patients (4.7 +/- 1.2 mm) in the left arm. Suitable veins in the forearm were recorded in 73 (57%) patients on the right (3.7 +/- 0.7 mm) and in 76 (59%) patients on the left (3.5 +/- 1.0 mm) side. The inner arterial diameter was: brachial-right 4.6 +/- 0.6 mm (calcifications in 26%), left 4.6 +/- 0.7 mm (calcifications in 20%); radial-right 2.3 +/- 0.4 mm (calcifications in 36%), left 2.3 +/- 0.5 mm (calcifications in 29%). In 32% of patients, one native AVF was possible, in 17% two, in 23% three and in 18% four, while in 10% no AVF was possible. In 84% of patients an AVF was constructed, with no significant difference in non-diabetic vs. diabetic patients (88% vs. 80%) or females vs. males (87% vs. 83%). Native AVF can be constructed in the majority of elderly patients, often in multiple positions, with no significant differences in terms of sex or diabetic status.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is known as an independent predictor of mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis; nevertheless, there is a lack of studies about the impact of vascular calcification in renal transplant recipients, and none of them use the Kauppila Index (KI) as a predictor of patient and graft prognosis.; Methods: We conducted an observational, retrospective study of 119 renal transplants, evaluating abdominal aortic calcifications (L4-S1) with the KI. We established 2 categories: absence (KI = 0-2) and presence (KI = 3-24) of VCs before transplantation. We analyzed the impact of calcification in graft and patient survival, new-onset diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular events, renal function, and mineral metabolism.; Results: VCs were observed in 50 patients (42%) before renal transplantation. Patients with VCs were older, but no statistical differences were found in the pre-transplant study between sex, diabetes, body mass index, and cardiovascular events. We found a major patient survival (limited to first 2 years after transplantation), graft survival, and death-censored graft survival in those without VCs (P = .037, P = .015, and P = .023, respectively). In line with results, a higher incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) and cardiovascular death was observed in the group with preexisting calcification (P = .016/P = .019). In the multivariable analysis, VCs were not an independent predictor for graft loss, death-censored graft loss, or major cardiovascular events.; Conclusions: Simple evaluation of VCs with the use of the KI at the time of transplantation relates with graft and patient survival and with MACE after renal transplantation.; Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Hypertension (HTN) develops very early in childhood chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is linked with rapid progression of kidney disease, increased morbidity and mortality hence the imperative to start anti-hypertensive medication when blood pressure (BP) is persistently > 90(th) percentile for age, gender, and height in non-dialyzing hypertensive children with CKD. HTN pathomechanism in CKD is multifactorial and complexly interwoven. The patient with CKD-associated HTN needs to be carefully evaluated for co-morbidities that frequently alter the course of the disease as successful treatment of HTN in CKD goes beyond life style modification and anti-hypertensive therapy alone. Chronic anaemia, volume overload, endothelial dysfunction, arterial media calcification, and metabolic derangements like secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphataemia, and calcitriol deficiency are a few co-morbidities that may cause or worsen HTN in CKD. It is important to know if the HTN is caused or made worse by the toxic effects of medications like erythropoietin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Poor treatment response may be due to any of these co-morbidities and medications. A satisfactory hypertensive CKD outcome, therefore, depends very much on identifying and managing these co-morbid conditions and HTN promoting medications promptly and appropriately. This review attempts to point attention to factors that may affect successful treatment of the hypertensive CKD child and how to attain the desired therapeutic BP target.;

AB  - Background: Risk factors for mitral annular calcification (MAC) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) demonstrate significant overlap in the general population. The aim of this paper is to determine whether there are independent relationships between MAC and demographics, traditional and novel CVD risk factors using cardiac CT in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) in a cross-sectional study.; Methods: A sample of 2070 subjects underwent coronary calcium scanning during the CRIC study. Data were obtained for each participant at time of scan.; Subjects: were dichotomized into the presence and absence of MAC. Differences in baseline demographic and transitional risk factor data were evaluated across groups. Covariates used in multivariable adjustment were age, gender, BMI, HDL, LDL, lipid lowering medications, smoking status, family history of heart attack, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, phosphate, PTH, albuminuria, and calcium.; Results: Our study consisted of 2070 subjects, of which 331 had MAC (prevalence of 16.0%). The mean MAC score was 511.98 (SD 1368.76). Age and white race remained independently associated with presence of MAC. Decreased GFR was also a risk factor. African American and Hispanic race, as well as former smoking status were protective against MAC. In multivariable adjusted analyses, the remaining covariates were not significantly associated with MAC. Among renal covariates, elevated phosphate was significant.; Conclusion: In the CRIC population, presence of MAC was independently associated with age, Caucasian race, decreased GFR, and elevated phosphate. These results are suggested by mechanisms of dysregulation of inflammation, hormones, and electrolytes in subjects with renal disease.; Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Vascular calcifications (VC) are common in patients with chronic kidney disease and present one of manifestations of mineral and bone disorders in these patients.; Objective: The aim of this pilot study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of VC in pre-dialysis patients with Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and other kidney diseases.; Methods: The study involved 32 pre-dialysis patients, 15 with BEN and 17 with other kidney diseases. All the patients underwent an interview, objective examination, routine laboratory analyses and measurement of serum concentration of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] and osteopontin. VCs in iliac, femoral, radial, and digital arteries were evaluated and Adragao VC score was calculated. The samples of radial artery were collected during the first creation of an arteriovenous fistula, and expression of osteocalcin, bone morphogenic protein-2 osteopontin, and matrix Gla-protein in arterial wall were examined.; Results: Patients with BEN were significantly older (71.1 ± 6.1 vs. 54.7 ± 11.1 years), but they had significantly lower systolic and mean blood pressure (95.7 ± 13.2 mmHg vs. 104.3 ± 7.4 mmHg) and lower serum concentration of phosphorus (1.32 ± 0.36 mmol/l vs. 1.65 ± 0.35 mmol/l) and cholesterol (4.3 ± 1.1 mmol/l vs. 5.2 ± 0.8 mmol/l) than patients with other kidney diseases. Mean VC score was significantly lower in patients with BEN than in those with other kidney diseases (2.8 ± 1.7 vs. 4.6 ± 1.8; p = 0.009), but expression of four examined proteins in arterial wall differed insignificantly between the two groups. VC score correlated significantly with serum concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides (positively), and iPTH (negatively).; Conclusion: Pre-dialysis BEN patients had a significantly lower mean score of VC than patients with other kidney diseases.;

AB  - We assessed the prevalence of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in older living kidney donors and its effect on recipient eGFR and graft histology. A total of 292 consecutive living pairs with donor age ≥50 from 2003 to 2013 were identified (mean age 56; range 50-78; F/M: 1.8). Donor AAC was determined by prenephrectomy unenhanced CT. Recipient eGFR and spot urine protein: creatinine ratios (UPCRs) were recorded. A total of 180 recipients had 6-month protocol biopsies. AAC was present in 40.7% of donors, and they were older (58.6 versus 54.7 years old, P < 0.0001) and more likely to be male (77.6% vs. 37.3%, P = 0.004). There was no significant difference in eGFR or spot UPCR up to 36 months in recipients of allografts from donors with versus without AAC. At 6-month biopsy, there was a higher percentage of allografts with vascular fibrous intimal thickening and arteriolar hyaline thickening from donors with versus without AAC (vascular fibrous intimal thickening: 38.8% vs. 7.1% and arteriolar hyaline thickening: 35.8% vs. 7.1%; P < 0.001 for both). The presence of donor AAC predicts the presence of vascular disease [vascular fibrous intimal thickening (OR: 7.2; CI:2.9-17.9) and arteriolar hyaline thickening (OR:5.7; CI:2.3-14.1)] in allografts at 6 months. Donor AAC is predictive of renal vascular disease and may help to improve the screening of potential donors and inform post-transplant management.; © 2015 Steunstichting ESOT.

AB  - Background: Intracranial artery calcification has been reported to be an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke. Also, existence of a positive correlation has been reported between the presence of arterial calcification and that of ischemic changes in the area supplied by such arteries. While intracranial artery calcification has frequently been observed on computed tomographic (CT) images of the brain in hemodialysis patients, its prevalence has not been reported previously. We investigated our hemodialysis outpatients to determine the prevalence of intracranial artery calcification in these patients in comparison with that in healthy controls.; Methods: Brain CT examinations were performed in 107 patients under maintenance hemodialysis therapy. For comparison, 43 representatives of the general population who underwent a brain CT examination as part of a health checkup were also studied as control subjects.; Results: Intracranial calcifications were more frequently found among hemodialysis patients (87.9%) than among control subjects (53.5%, P = 0.0003), and the prevalences of calcification in each of the intracranial arteries in the two groups were as follows: vertebral artery (65.5% vs. 25.6%, P = 0.0002), internal carotid artery (62.1% vs. 18.6%, P < 0.0001), basilar artery (34.5% vs. 34.9%, ns), anterior cerebral artery (0 vs. 2.3%, ns), middle cerebral artery (24.1% vs. 20.9%, ns), and posterior cerebral artery (5.2% vs. 4.7%, ns).; Conclusions: A much higher rate of intracranial artery calcification was observed in hemodialysis patients than in the general population, and the most frequently involved sites of calcification in these patients were the relatively large intracranial arteries.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcifications are highly prevalent in patients maintained on chronic hemodialysis. They have been linked to numerous risk factors and have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the prevalence of vascular calcifications among dialysis patients in our tertiary care center and to identify the associated risk factors.; Methods: In the current study, we reviewed the charts of 43 patients undergoing hemodialysis at our center. We estimated the prevalence of vascular calcifications among dialysis patients using plain X-ray of the hand as the screening tool. We compared patient's characteristics and tried to identify possible risk factors, with a special emphasis on the subgroup of patients with diabetes.; Results: Vascular calcifications were prevalent among half of the patients on hemodialysis. Duration of dialysis (p = 0.02), diabetes (p < 0.001), and hypertension (p = 0.01) were highly associated with vascular calcifications. No association was found between vascular calcifications and age, gender, calcium-based phosphate binders, vitamin D supplementation, smoking, and lipid control. In multivariate analyses, diabetes and duration of dialysis were the only independent predictors of vascular calcifications and diabetics developed vascular calcifications earlier than nondiabetics (31 months vs 69 months).; Conclusion: Vascular calcifications are moderately prevalent among patients undergoing hemodialysis at our center, and were found to be strongly correlated with diabetes and duration of dialysis. A larger, multicenter, prospective study should be conducted at national level, in order to confirm the findings of this study and to identify further modifiable risk factors, to decrease the incidence of vascular calcifications and the incurring cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in our population.;

AB  - Warfarin inhibits vitamin-K dependent proteins involved in bone mineralization and the prevention of vascular calcification (bone Gla protein BGP, matrix Gla protein MGP). In this multicenter, cross-sectional study with 3-year follow-up, data from 387 patients on hemodialysis for ≥1 year at 18 dialysis units were analyzed. Patients on warfarin treatment for > 1 year (11.9% of the population) were compared with the remaining cohort for vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications and mortality. Vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications were sought in L-L vertebral X-rays (D5 to L4). Compared with controls, warfarin-treated male patients had more vertebral fractures (77.8 vs. 57.7%, p<0.04), but not females (42.1% vs. 48.4%, p=0.6); total BGP was significantly reduced (82.35 vs. 202 µg/L, p<0.0001), with lower levels in treated men (69.5 vs. women 117.0 µg/L, p=0.03). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the use of warfarin was associated with increased odds of aortic (OR 2.58, p<0.001) and iliac calcifications (OR 2.86, p<0.001); identified confounders were age, atrial fibrillation, angina, PPI use and total BGP. Seventy-seven patients died during a 2.7±0.5 year follow-up. In univariate Cox regression analysis, patients on warfarin had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42-4.16, p=0.001) when compared with those untreated and data adjustment for confounders attenuated but confirmed the significant warfarin-mortality link (HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.02-3.84, P=0.046). In hemodialysis patients, additional studies are warranted to verify the risk/benefit ratio of warfarin, which appears to be associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality.;

AB  - Aims: To compare the feasibility, procedural and clinical outcomes after implantation of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) in patients with calcified lesions.; Methods and Results: We assessed the feasibility of BVS implantation and procedural outcomes in patients with and without calcific lesions. The primary outcome was angiographic and procedural success. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Of 163 patients, 62 (38%) had calcified lesions. Patients with calcific lesions had a higher prevalence of diabetes (35.5% vs. 22.8%, p=0.078) and chronic kidney disease (31.1% vs. 13.9%, p=0.008), and higher SYNTAX scores (18.9±9.7 vs. 15.1±9.0, p=0.017). Calcific lesions required longer procedures (126.4±39.8 vs. 106.9±37.1 min, p=0.015), more frequent use of dedicated devices and IVUS. Acute gain (1.83±0.6 vs. 1.86±0.6, p=0.732) and angiographic success were similar (98% non-calcific vs. 95.2% calcific, p=0.369), whereas procedural success was reduced in patients with calcific lesions (94.1% vs. 83.9%, p=0.034) due to higher rates of periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) (5% vs. 13.1%, p=0.067). During the median follow-up time of 14 months MACE rates (10.9% non-calcific vs. 12.9% calcific, plog-rank=0.546) were similar.; Conclusions: Treating calcific lesions with BVS is feasible with high angiographic success rates, at the expense of longer procedure times, aggressive lesion preparation and increased rates of periprocedural MI.;

AB  - Backgrounds and Aims: The presence and progression of vascular calcification have been demonstrated as important risk factors for mortality in dialysis patients. However, since the majority of subjects included in most previous studies were hemodialysis patients, limited information was available in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and prognostic value of AoAC progression in PD patients.; Methods: We prospectively determined AoAC by chest X-ray at PD start and after 12 months, and evaluated the impact of AoAC progression on mortality in 415 incident PD patients.; Results: Of 415 patients, 169 patients (40.7%) had AoAC at baseline with a mean of 18.1±11.2%. The presence of baseline AoAC was an independent predictor of all-cause [Hazard ratio (HR): 2.181, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.336-3.561, P = 0.002] and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 3.582, 95% CI: 1.577-8.132, P = 0.002). Among 363 patients with follow-up chest X-rays at 12 months after PD start, the proportion of patients with AoAC progression was significantly higher in patients with baseline AoAC (64.2 vs. 5.3%, P<0.001). Moreover, all-cause and cardiovascular death rates were significantly higher in the progression groups than in the non-progression group (P<0.001). Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that AoAC progression was an independent predictor for all-cause (HR: 2.625, 95% CI: 1.150-5.991, P = 0.022) and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 4.008, 95% CI: 1.079-14.890, P = 0.038) in patients with AoAC at baseline.; Conclusions: The presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest X-ray were independently associated with unfavorable outcomes in incident PD patients. Regular follow-up by chest X-ray could be a simple and useful method to stratify mortality risk in these patients.;

There are limited prospective data however on progression of arterial stiffness in CKD, including evaluating associations with bone mineral markers such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble α-klotho (sKl).; Methods: In this prospective, single-center, observational study, arterial stiffness [measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV)] and hormones influencing mineral homeostasis, including serum FGF23 and sKl, were compared between non-dialysis CKD stages 4/5 and healthy controls at baseline and 12 months (12 m). Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was quantitated using lateral lumbar radiography at baseline.; Results: Forty patients with CKD [mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 19.5 ± 6.7 mL/min/1.73m2] and 42 controls (mean eGFR 88.6 ± 12.9 mL/min/1.73m2) completed follow-up. There were no differences in age, gender and body mass index between groups. A significant increase in FGF23 [240.6 (141.9-1129.8) to 396.8 (160.3-997.7) pg/mL, p = 0.001] was observed in the CKD group but serum phosphate, corrected calcium, parathyroid hormone and sKl did not change significantly over 12 m. At baseline, CKD subjects had higher AAC prevalence [83.8% versus (vs.) 43.6%, p = 0.002] and higher aortic PWV [9.7(7.6-11.7) vs. 8.1 (7.2-9.7) m/s, p = 0.047] compared to controls. At 12 m, aortic PWV increased by 1.3 m/s (95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 2.08, p < 0.001) in the CKD cohort, with 30% of subjects showing progression from normal aortic elasticity to stiffening (PWV > 10 m/s). Serum FGF23 was associated with AAC, abnormal PWV and progression of PWV at 12 m.; Conclusions: Arterial stiffness and serum FGF23, both of which are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, increased over one year in individuals with CKD. Additionally, a significant association was found between serum FGF23 and arterial calcification and stiffness. Larger clinical studies and further experimental work are warranted to delineate the temporal relationship as well as the pathological mechanisms linking FGF23 and vascular disease.;

AB  - Background and Objectives: Vascular calcification is increasingly recognized as an important component of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease. The objective of this study was to investigate prospectively the determinants, cardiovascular functional consequences, and survival associated with vascular calcification over 24 mo.; Design, Setting, Participants,& Measurements: A total of 134 patients (60 on hemodialysis, 28 on peritoneal dialysis, and 46 with stage 4 chronic kidney disease) were studied. Vascular calcification of the superficial femoral artery was assessed using multislice spiral computed tomography; pulse wave velocity; all medications and time-averaged biochemical parameters were recorded at baseline and 12 and 24 mo.; Results: A total of 101 patients remained at 24 mo. Progressive calcification was seen in 58 of 101 patients. Most (31 of 46) patients with an initial calcification score of zero did not develop calcification. The hemodialysis group demonstrated a greater degree of progression than patients who were on peritoneal dialysis or had stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Progressive calcification was associated with age, male gender, serum alkaline phosphatase, beta blockers, and lipid-lowering agents. Increases in vascular calcification correlated with increased arterial stiffness. Vascular calcification was present in 20 of 21 patients who died. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified change in calcification score, calcium intake from phosphate binders, and low albumin as risk factors for death.; Conclusions: Patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease and preexisting vascular calcification exhibit significantly increased calcification over 24 mo. Rapid progression of calcification is associated with arterial stiffness and mortality.;

AB  - Background: Increased arterial stiffness and vascular calcification have been recognized as important predictors of cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease.; Method: In order to examine the precise temporal link between aortic stiffness and cardiovascular risk at the earliest stages of chronic kidney disease, we studied a cohort of 150 patients with chronic kidney disease (52 stage 2/3 patients, 51 stage 4/5 patients and 47 stage 5D patients). Each patient underwent a plain, lateral lumbar radiograph and an abdominal and thoracic multislice spiral computer tomography scan in order to identify and quantify aortic and coronary calcifications. Pulse wave velocity was used as a measure of arterial stiffness.; Results: Regardless of the disease stage, patients with chronic kidney disease had higher adjusted pulse wave velocity than controls with preserved renal function (14.6 +/- 3.8 vs. 10.7 +/- 1.7 m/s, respectively; P < 0.0001). Regarding aortic calcification, there was a gradual but significant rise in later chronic kidney disease stages. A similar trend was found for coronary calcification. In a multivariate analysis only age, mean arterial pressure, diabetes and the aortic calcification score were independent determinants of higher pulse wave velocity.; Conclusion: We found that both vascular stiffness and vascular calcification appear early in patients with chronic kidney disease, but only vascular calcification worsens as the disease progresses. The increase of vascular stiffness in adult patients with chronic kidney disease seems to be more related to age, systolic blood pressure, diabetes and vascular calcification than to uremic toxicity.;

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular mortality is high among patients with chronic kidney disease. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a simple method used for arterial distensibility evaluation. Few data are available concerning PWV in pre-dialysis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between PWV and cardiovascular disease in pre-dialysis.; Methods: One hundred and four patients were submitted to PWV analysis, coronary artery calcium (CAC) determination with a multi-slice CT scan of the coronary arteries, echocardiogram and a carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) evaluation, with a high resolution ultrasound. The demographic characteristics and laboratory tests results were studied.; Results: The mean age of those studied was 54.4 +/- 11.5 years, 60% were males and the mean creatinine clearance was 40 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The mean PWV was 12.2 +/- 3.4 m/s and it was significantly higher in males, diabetics, those with creatinine clearance <60 ml/min and proteinuria > or =1 g/24 h. PWV was correlated with systolic blood pressure, age, triglycerides, total cholesterol and 24 h proteinuria. In the multiple regression analysis, PWV was significantly associated with diabetes, age, systolic blood pressure and cholesterol. Fifty-eight patients (56%) presented coronary calcification and PWV correlated with coronary calcium score (R = 0.48; P < 0.001) and calcium volume (R = 0.50; P < 0.001). Moreover, PWV was higher in patients with coronary calcification (13.4 +/- 3.6 m/s vs 10.7 +/- 2.4 m/s; P < 0.001). The mean left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was 106 +/- 31 g/m(2) and 24% of patients had left ventricular hypertrophy, while 19 (18.3%) patients had left ventricular dysfunction. PVW was correlated with LVMI (R = 0.25; P = 0.01) while no association could be seen between PWV and the ejection fraction or left ventricular dysfunction. A correlation between the IMT and PWV was observed (R = 0.27; P = 0.005). In addition, those with a thicker IMT had a higher PWV (13.2 +/- 3.4 m/s vs 11. 2 +/- 3.2 m/s; P = 0.003).; Conclusion: PWV is associated with cardiovascular disease in pre-dialysis patients and can be a useful tool to identify patients with increased cardiovascular risk.;

AB  - Purpose: Bone metabolism disorder is often associated with cardiovascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sclerostin, a novel candidate protein, has been identified to be involved in the bone-vascular axis. The aims of the current investigation were to assess vessel sclerostin expression and its relationship with circulating sclerostin levels.; Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from January 2012 to December 2014. Thirty-two predialysis patients with CKD stage 5 who received arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operations were enrolled in this study. Radial arteries were collected and paraffin-embedded during the AVF operation, followed by immunohistochemical staining for sclerostin expression. In addition, serum sclerostin levels were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.; Results: The prevalence of positive sclerostin staining in the radial arteries was 56.25%. Sclerostin expression was localized in the artery media layer. Serum sclerostin levels in patients with positive sclerostin expression were much higher than in those with negative expression (p = 0.018). Multivariate logistic regression analyses including potential confounders as age, gender, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, serum sclerostin, corrected calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), Ca × P product, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed that only serum sclerostin levels were closely related to vessel sclerostin expression (p = 0.025). The area under the curve of serum sclerostin levels for predicting positive vessel sclerostin expression was 0.742 with 61.1% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity (p  = 0.008). The cutoff point for vessel sclerostin expression of serum sclerostin was 1591.53 pg/mL.; Conclusions: Positive expression of sclerostin in the radial artery media layer was related to high serum sclerostin levels. Sclerostin may act as both a local and systemic regulator involved in vascular calcification.;

AB  - Insufficient control of serum calcium and phosphate levels in patients undergoing hemodialysis is associated with increased mortality. As commonly used calcium-containing phosphate binders can cause arterial calcification, newly developed calcium-free phosphate binders, such as sevelamer hydrochloride (SH) and lanthanum carbonate (LC), have received much attention. We assessed the efficacy and safety of SH and LC treatment in Japanese patients undergoing hemodialysis in a prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) crossover study. Forty-two patients were randomized to receive SH or LC for 13 weeks, with the dosages adjusted every 2 weeks, followed by treatment with the other drug for another 13 weeks. The average daily doses of SH and LC were 2971 ± 1464 mg and 945 ± 449 mg, respectively. The mean dosage ratio of SH to LC was 3.05, which was maintained throughout the treatment period. SH and LC were similarly effective at controlling serum calcium and phosphate levels in the majority of patients (78-93%). A few serious adverse events (AEs) involving the biliary system occurred during the LC treatment period, but they were not considered to be treatment-induced. Although the incidence of constipation, the most common treatment-related AE, was higher during the SH period (27% vs. 5%; P < 0.05), no difference was observed in total treatment-related AEs. This study demonstrates that SH and LC are comparable treatments for controlling serum phosphate and calcium levels, and that both compounds are safe and well-tolerated in Japanese patients undergoing hemodialysis.; © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The extracellular protein fetuin-A is a potent soluble inhibitor of calcification, and its deficiency has been associated with vascular calcification in dialysis patients. In proteinuric patients, significant urinary losses of fetuin-A may cause low serum fetuin-A levels.; Methods: In a cross-sectional study, urinary/serum concentrations of fetuin-A were investigated in proteinuric children with glomerular diseases and preserved renal function (n = 58) in comparison to healthy controls (n = 246).; Results: Mean fetuin-A serum concentrations were clearly reduced in children with nephrotic syndrome (0.25 ± 0.14 g/l, p < 0.001), slightly reduced in children with large proteinuria (0.39 ± 0.15 g/l, p < 0.05), and comparable to controls in those with mild proteinuria (0.45 ± 0.14 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12 g/l). Fetuin-A was positively correlated with serum protein (r = 0.58), albumin (r = 0.57), and calcium (r = 0.64), but negatively correlated with proteinuria (r = -0.41), albuminuria (r = -0.46), and urinary fetuin-A excretion (r = -0.48; each p < 0.001). The fractional excretion of fetuin-A was significantly associated with the degree of proteinuria and serum fetuin-A levels. However, the urinary loss of fetuin-A and albumin in nephrotic children differed by three orders of magnitude and the mean fractional excretion of fetuin-A was only 1/10 of that of albumin (0.016 ± 0.029 vs. 0.162 ± 0.403%; p < 0.001).; Conclusions: Fetuin-A is clearly reduced in children with nephrotic syndrome and associated with the degree of hypoalbuminemia. This is due to urinary fetuin-A loss and/or reduced hepatic synthesis. Persistent fetuin-A deficiency may have an impact on cardiovascular morbidity in nephrotic children.; Copyright © 2011 S.

AB  - We previously demonstrated a strong relation between carotid atherosclerosis (defined as carotid artery stenosis > or =50%) and intracranial artery calcification (IAC) in ischemic stroke patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between aortic atherosclerosis and IAC. Four hundred fifty-four patients with ischemic stroke were included. Complex aortic plaques (CAP) were assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and defined as plaques > or =4 mm thick or with mobile components in the proximal aorta. IAC were assessed in the seven major cerebral arteries and a semiquantitative score system was applied, ranging from 0 (no calcification) to 7. Forty-two patients (9.3%) had CAP. Patients with CAP were older compared with patients without CAP (73.6 vs. 63.6 years, p < 0.001), had more vascular risk factors, more significant carotid artery atherosclerosis (p < 0.001), more chronic kidney disease (p < 0.001), and a higher IAC score (3.0 vs. 1.8; p < 0.001). Stepwise logistic regression selected the following independent factors for CAP: previous stroke or TIA (OR 3.3; 95%CI 1.5-7.0; p = 0.002), carotid artery stenosis > or =50% (OR 3.7; 95%CI 1.7-8.0; p = 0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR 3.8; 95%CI 1.9-7.8; p < 0.001), and IAC score (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.2-1.9; p = 0.002). IAC was present in 100% of patients with CAP. Moreover, IAC had a high sensitivity (100%) and negative predictive value (100%) for the presence of CAP. In ischemic stroke patients, the absence of IAC strongly points to the lack of CAP. However, these results warrant confirmation in prospective studies before concluding the non-utility of the use of TEE to exclude CAP as a potential source of cerebral embolism in patients without IAC.;

AB  - Background: Fractures are a common morbidity that lead to worse outcomes in dialysis patients. Fetuin A inhibits vascular calcification (VC), potentially promotes bone mineralization and its level positively correlates with bone mineral density in the general population. On the other hand, the presence of VC is associated with low bone volume in dialysis patients. Whether the fetuin A level and VC can predict the occurrence of fractures in dialysis patients remains unknown.; Methods: We performed this prospective, observational cohort study including 685 dialysis patients (629 hemodialysis and 56 peritoneal dialysis) from a single center in Taiwan for a median follow-up period of 3.4 years. The baseline fetuin A level and status of presence of aortic arch calcification (VC) and incidence of major fractures (hip, pelvis, humerus, proximal forearm, lower leg or vertebrae) were assessed using adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, recursive partitioning analysis and competing risk models.; Results: Overall, 177 of the patients had major fractures. The incidence rate of major fractures was 3.29 per 100 person-years. In adjusted analyses, the patients with higher baseline fetuin A levels had a lower incidence of fractures (adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 0.3; 95% CI, 0.18‒0.5, fetuin A tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 and HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34‒0.78, tertile 2 vs. tertile 1). The presence of aortic arch calcification (VC) independently predicted the occurrence of fractures (adjusted HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.34‒2.84) as well. When accounting for death as an event in competing risk models, the patients with higher baseline fetuin A levels remained to have a lower incidence of fractures (SHR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17‒0.56, fetuin A tertile 3 vs. tertile 1 and 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32‒0.81, tertile 2 vs. tertile 1).; Interpretations: Lower baseline fetuin A levels and the presence of VC were independently linked to higher risk of incident fractures in prevalent dialysis patients.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification and cardiovascular events are common in hemodialysis patients. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) plays an important role in vascular calcification and bone remodeling. This study investigates the effects of soluble RANKL (sRANKL) on cardiovascular events in hemodialysis patients.; Methods: Serum sRANKL levels of 47 patients were tested by ELISA. Vascular calcification was radiographically measured and patients were followed up for 2 years.; Results: After 2 years, 10 (36.6%) patients had experienced cardiovascular events. Seventy-five percent (6/9) of mortality was due to cardiovascular disease. Patients experiencing cardiovascular events showed significantly higher vascular calcification scores (VCS) (3.20 +/- 2.74 vs. 1.19 +/- 1.60; t = 2.999; p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that serum sRANKL levels, vascular calcification scores and phosphorus were independent determinants of cardiovascular events.; Conclusion: Serum sRANKL levels and VCS are independent risk factors, and hemodialysis patients with low serum sRANKL levels have a risk of cardiovascular events.; Copyright 2009 S.

AB  - Background: Immunoglobulin light chains are classified as middle molecule uremic toxins able to interact with B lymphocyte membranes leading to the activation of transmembrane signaling. The ensuing impairment of neutrophil function can contribute to the chronic inflammation state of uremic patients, and the increased risk of bacterial infections or vascular calcifications. The aim of this crossover observational study was to assess the difference in free light chain removal by three different hemodialysis filters in patients not affected by multiple myeloma.; Methods: Free light chain removal was compared in the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membrane Filtryzer BK-F, the polyphenylene HFR17 filter and the conventional polysulfone filter F7HPS. Twenty chronic hemodialysis patients were enrolled: mean age was 67.7 ± 17.0 years, M/F = 14/6, dialysis vintage (months) 25.5 ± 32.0. The patients were randomized into two groups of treatment lasting 6 weeks each. The dialysis sessions checked were the midweek sessions and the blood was drawn at times 0, 120' and 240'. Kappa (k) and lambda (λ) light chain levels, β2microglobulin (β2M), C reactive protein (CRP) and albumin were checked.; Results: K light chain levels were 345.0 ± 100.0 mg/L, λ light chains were 121.4 ± 27.0 mg/L. The values of k light chains at times 120' and 240' were significantly lower with PMMA and HFR17 than those obtained with F7. The reduction ratio per session (RRs) for k light chains was 44.1 ± 4.3% with HFR17, 55.3 ± 3.4% with PMMA, 25.7 ± 8.3% with F7 (p = 0.018). The RRs for λ light chains was 30.3 ± 2.9% with HFR17, 37.8 ± 17.3% with PMMA, 14.0 ± 3.9% with F7 (p = 0.032). As to β2M, RRs was 42.4 ± 3.2% with HFR17 vs. 33.9 ± 2.8% with PMMA vs. 6.3 ± 1.9% with F7 (p = 0.022). The three filters tested showed no differences in CRP or albumin levels.; Conclusion: In terms of light chain and β2M removal, the PMMA and on-line HFR filters are similar and both are significantly more effective than the F7 filter in chronic dialysis patients.; Trial Registration: The present trial was registered retrospectively ( NCT02950389 , 31/10/2016).;

AB  - To assess the influence of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on the evolution of renal osteodystrophy, we studied 36 adult patients with end-stage renal failure before starting dialysis and after 7-30 months. 17 patients (12 males and 5 females) were treated by CAPD as first treatment and 19 (14 males and 5 females) received maintenance hemodialysis. The two groups were age- and sex-matched and no patient received vitamin D. All patients had adequate clinical and metabolic follow-up with a radiological survey and quantitative bone histology at the start of dialysis and at the end of the study. Serum phosphate concentrations were much easier to control in CAPD than in hemodialysis patients. There was no difference in the evolutive pattern of vascular and periarticular calcifications in the two groups. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were frequently lower in CAPD than in hemodialysis patients. In some CAPD patients, there was a significant loss of trabecular bone volume at the end of the study. The radiological and histological appearances of secondary hyperparathyroidism improved or seemed to worsen to a lesser degree in CAPD compared to hemodialysis patients.;

AB  - The best treatment for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is kidney transplantation, but the renal transplant recipients still have a higher incidence of cardiovascular events compared with general population. Cardiovascular risk factors were imposed long before ESRD, as the majority of patients starting dialysis or kidney transplantation already have signs of advanced atherosclerosis. Artery calcification is an organized, regulated process similar to bone formation. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is found frequently in advanced atherosclerotic lesions and could be a useful marker of them. We evaluated the prevalence of CAC in 49 stable renal transplant recipients and in 48 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in stages 2-5 not requiring dialysis to assess risk factors associated with CAC. Computed tomography was used for CAC detection and quantification (CAC score). The prevalence of CAC was 43.8% in transplant recipients and 16.7% in CKD patients (p < 0.001). Transplant recipients with CAC were significantly older and had longer duration of CKD and/or dialysis than recipients without CAC. In contrast, the serum levels of fetuin A (an inhibitor of vascular calcification) and albumin were significantly lower in CKD patients with CAC than those without CAC. During the observation period (30 months), 30 patients, including 23 CKD patients, began dialysis, and 4 transplant recipients and 2 CKD patients died. Independent predictors of mortality were age, serum amyloid A and the CAC score. In conclusion, the examination and prevention of risk factors associated with atherosclerosis should be started at the beginning of renal failure.;

AB  - Vascular calcification is accelerated during dialysis and is known to be an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can be simply estimated with an AoAC score (AoACS) using plain chest radiography. The objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors for AoAC progression. The enrolled subjects were 125 newly treated hemodialysis patients and 59 peritoneal dialysis patients. In the patients who had undergone chest radiography before initial dialysis therapy and every year, we estimated AoACS and then divided the patients into two groups based on the presence or absence of AoAC progression. We also compared the baseline clinical and biochemical profiles in the two groups. Eighty-five (46.2%) were men (mean age, 58.6 ± 12.7 years). Seventy-six patients (41.3%) had AoAC before initial dialysis, with a mean AoACS of 13.0 ± 20.4%. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.7 ± 1.0 years. Half of the patients (50%) had progressive AoAC. Age >65 years (p = 0.003), dialysis duration (p = 0.004), diabetes (p = 0.015), and the presence of AoAC at baseline (p = 0.001) were related to AoAC progression. No significant association was found between AoAC progression and the baseline clinical parameters, including gender, obesity, hypertension, and dialysis modality. In a multivariate analysis, dialysis duration (p = 0.003) and the presence of AoAC at baseline (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for AoAC progression in patients undergoing dialysis. The duration of dialysis and the presence of AoAC before initial dialysis were significantly related to the progression of AoAC in these patients. The results suggest that patients should be carefully managed from the predialysis stage to prevent AoAC progression and to reduce cardiovascular morbidity.; © 2011 The Authors; Hemodialysis International © 2011 International Society for Hemodialysis.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Vascular calcification independently predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD), and computed tomography (CT) is a useful tool to evaluate and quantify not only coronary but also thoracic aortic calcification (TAC). Previous TAC progression reports were limited to dialysis and renal transplant patients. This is the first study to evaluate TAC progression in a large multiethnic cohort without clinically evident CVD at entry.; Methods: Non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CTs were obtained in 5886 of 6814 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants (mean age, 62 years; 48% males; 40% white, 27% black, 21% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese). Baseline and follow-up TAC scores were derived.; Results: Overall, 4308 (73%) participants had no detectable baseline TAC. Mean follow-up duration was 2.4 ± 0.8 years, during which 12% developed TAC. The overall incidence rate was 4.8%/year and was greater with age across gender and ethnic groups; TAC incidence was significantly lower in blacks than whites. After adjustment for follow-up duration, regression analyses showed age, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensives, and smoking were associated with incident TAC. A total of 1578 (27%) participants had TAC at baseline with a positive association between average annual TAC change and baseline age. Although the overall median change was 32.9 (-1.4 to 112.2) Agatston units, 27% showed an annual score change of ≥100 and blacks showed the lowest median across ethnic groups; 22.7 (-3 to 86.8). Age, systolic blood pressure, lipid-lowering medication, diabetes, and smoking were associated with TAC progression.; Conclusions: In MESA, traditional CV risk factors were related to both TAC incidence and progression. Blacks had the lowest incidence and median change across ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings for coronary calcification.; Copyright © 2015 AUR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Calcification of soft tissue and blood vessel wall occurs more frequently in dialyzed patients. The purpose of the present study was to estimate the risk of abdominal aortic calcification among end stage renal disease patients under maintenance haemodialysis. This case-control study was carried out in the Department of Nephrology at National Institute of Kidney Diseases and Urology (NIKDU), Dhaka and National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease and Hospital (NICVD), Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2013 to December 2014 for a period of two (02) years. Chronic kidney disease in stage 5 {CKD-5(D)} patients older than 18 years on maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) for more than 3 months were selected as case group. And same age and sex non CKD patients were considered as control group. Serum calcium, serum albumin, serum phosphate and iPTH were estimated by semi-automated biochemistry analyzer from the Department of Biochemistry of NIKDU, Dhaka and NICVD, Dhaka. Plain X-ray abdomen in lateral view was performed for all patients. Total 100 patients were enrolled for this study of which 50 patients were in end stage renal disease (ESRD) group and the rest 50 patients were in non-CKD group. Abdominal aortic calcification on X ray was present in 22(44%) patients of ESRD group and 6(12%) patients of non CKD group of population. Mean±SD serum calcium (corrected) level was significantly high (p<0.001) in ESRD patients (9.79±0.87) compared to non CKD group of population (9.13±0.70). Mean±SD of serum phosphate level was significantly higher (p<0.001) in ESRD patients (5.71±0.96) compared to non CKD group of population (4.20±0.59). However, mean±SD iPTH level showed no significant difference between ESRD (25.33±51.98) and non CKD group of population (38.53±19.52), though iPTH level remain below the target level in ESRD group. Abdominal aortic calcification is significantly higher among ESRD subjects.;

AB  - Background: Sclerostin is an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of the Wnt pathway and has been shown to play a key role in chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). The present study aimed to validate its potential as a predictor of vascular calcification in patients with CKD stages 3-4.; Methods: A total of 97 patients with CKD stages 3-4 were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Routine clinical biochemistry tests and assays for sclerostin and mineral metabolism markers were performed. Additionally, vascular calcification was assessed by multislice spiral computed tomography. Logistic regression analyses were used to study the relationships between sclerostin and vascular calcification.; Results: Serum sclerostin levels (30.8 ± 6.4 vs. 41.7 ± 12.6 pmol/L, P < 0.05) were significantly elevated in patients with CKD stage 3a compared to in controls and increased with the decline in glomerular filtration rates. Furthermore, patients with vascular calcification had higher serum sclerostin levels. Patients with sclerostin levels above the median value had increased the prevalence of vascular calcification. Multivariate analysis revealed that sclerostin levels were positively associated with vascular calcification.; Conclusion: Our data indicate that sclerostin levels are elevated in patients with CKD and are associated with vascular calcification. Therefore, sclerostin may be used as a predictor of vascular calcification in the clinical setting.;

AB  - Context: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest that activated Wnt signaling contributes to VC.; Objective: The objective was to investigate whether circulating levels of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with progression of VC.; Design: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal observational Brussels Renal Transplant Cohort study.; Setting: The setting was a tertiary care academic hospital.; Patients: Coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification were measured by multislice spiral computerized tomography in 268 prevalent RTRs (age, 53 ± 13 y; 61% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189 patients after a median follow-up of 4.4 years. Baseline serum sclerostin levels were assessed on stored blood samples. Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of baseline VC and progression.; Main Outcome Measure: The main outcome measure was progression of VC.; Results: VC was present in up to 84% of participants at baseline. Almost half of the patients showed progression of VC, according to Hokanson criteria. The cross-sectional analysis at baseline demonstrated a direct association between sclerostin levels and VC score in univariate analysis, which became inverse after adjustment for age, gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level was identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline aorta calcification score in the final regression model. Moreover, baseline sclerostin levels showed an inverse association with VC progression, at least after adjustment for traditional risk factors.; Conclusions: Serum sclerostin levels inversely associated with VC burden and progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Our data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted chronic kidney disease patients and support the notion that sclerostin may be up-regulated in the vascular wall during the VC process as part of a local counterregulatory mechanism directed to suppress VC. Additional clinical and experimental data are required for confirmation.;

AB  - Background: Derangements in bone metabolism and vascular calcification (VC) substantially contribute to the accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wnt signalling pathway is increasingly recognized to play an important role in bone homeostasis and VC. Circulating levels of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin are elevated in CKD patients. The present study investigated whether the circulating levels of sclerostin are associated with all-cause mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods: We performed a post-hoc survival analysis in 100 prevalent HD patients (68 ± 13 years, 40 male) recruited in 2006 who were prospectively followed for median 637 (8-1000, range) days. Parameters of mineral metabolism including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bsAP) and serum sclerostin were determined in spare blood samples collected at baseline.; Results: Serum concentrations of serum sclerostin amounted to 110 (82-151) [median (iqr)] pmol/L. Patients with sclerostin levels above median were characterized by older age, higher haemoglobin and creatinine level and lower bsAP concentration. During a median follow-up of 637 days, 31 patients died. Higher circulating sclerostin levels were associated with decreased mortality in prevalent HD patients: unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.51 (0.24-1.06) (P = 0.06); HR adjusted for age and gender for serum sclerostin levels above versus below median was 0.33 (0.15-0.73) (P = 0.006). When bsAP was entered in the Cox regression analysis, it replaced sclerostin in the final model.; Conclusions: Our data show that high circulating sclerostin levels are associated with improved survival and suggest that a low bsAP activity may be in the causal pathway.;

AB  - Purpose: Hyperparathyroidism is associated with pulmonary vascular calcification and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in a chronic kidney failure dog model, and increased prevalence of PH and a PH-hyperparathyroidism relationship in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hemodialysis patients are reported. This study investigated the prevalence of PH and relationships between PH and metabolic abnormalities in patients with stage 1-4 proteinuria CKD.; Methods: One-hundred and ninety patients (mean age 61 ± 17.4, 116 males) with proteinuria CKD and no coronary diseases, congestive heart failure, smoking history, and pulmonary diseases were enrolled. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was 39.7 ± 23 ml/min. CKD etiology was diabetes mellitus in 52 (27.3 %), chronic glomerulonephritis or tubulointerstitial nephritis in 56 (29.4 %), hypertension in 36 (19 %), and other etiologies (nephrolithiasis, obstructive nephropathy, and amyloidosis) in 46 (25.3 %) patients. Echocardiography was performed, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and left ventricular ejection fraction were determined. Laboratory tests examined lipid parameters, serum albumin, urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, C-reactive protein, parathyroid hormone, ferritin, and hemoglobin levels.; Results: PH (PAP >35 mmHg) was detected in 68 patients (35.9 %). Patients with PH were older (68 ± 12.3 vs. 52.1 ± 16.7, p = 0.03), had lower ejection fractions (51.3 ± 13.4 vs. 60.8 ± 9.1 %, p = 0.003), lower hemoglobin (11.3 ± 1.5 vs. 12.1 ± 1.9, p = 0.05), and higher parathyroid hormone (218 ± 159.3 vs. 127.7 ± 67.4 pg/ml, p = 0.05) levels. The remaining parameters were similar between groups.; Conclusions: Older age, lower ejection fraction, and secondary hyperparathyroidism may contribute to PH in stage 1-4 proteinuria CKD.;

AB  - Background: Alkaline phosphatase is typically considered as an innocent by-stander, but emerging data suggest that alkaline phosphatase might play a pathogenic role in vascular calcification and thus contribute to increased mortality in hemodialysis patients.; Study Design: Longitudinal analyses of the existing HEMO Study database.; Setting and Participants: 1,827 HEMO Study participants.; Predictor: Serum alkaline phosphatase level. OUTCOME AND MEASUREMENTS: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality.; Results: Based on the median serum alkaline phosphatase of 97 IU/l, participants were divided into low (< 97 IU/l) and high (> or = 97 IU/l) serum alkaline phosphatase groups. The lower serum alkaline phosphatase group was associated with older age, male gender, non-black race and shorter dialysis years as well as higher serum calcium, higher serum calcium-phosphorus product and lower parathyroid hormone levels. Mean serum liver enzyme values were in the normal range in both groups, but the high alkaline phosphatase group had slightly higher values. In a multivariate time-dependent Cox model using baseline and follow-up values of serum alkaline phosphatase levels, adjusted for demographics, HEMO Study groups, comorbidity, bone metabolism parameters and liver enzymes, each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly associated with increased hazard of all-cause (hazard ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.30 - 1.59) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16 - 1.57).; Limitations: Nonstandardized measurements of alkaline phosphatase.; Conclusions: Serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis patients, independent of bone metabolism parameters and liver enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase might be a potential therapeutic target in hemodialysis patients.;

AB  - Background: Chronic renal disease (CKD) is a determinant of coronary artery calcification (CAC), which is a predictor of cardiovascular events. However, in a population without CKD, the association between CAC and renal function is unclear. CAC is affected by sex. This study aimed to determine whether serum cystatin C, a sensitive marker of kidney function, or sex differences are associated with CAC in patients without CKD.; Methods: We evaluated 456 consecutive patients (61±13 years, 42% women) without CKD and evidence of coronary artery disease. The CAC (Agatston) score was examined by multidetector computed tomography.; Results: When patients were categorized into three CAC groups based on the Agatston score, mild (<10), moderate (11-399), and severe (≥400) in each sex, serum cystatin C levels gradually increased by severity of CAC in women, but not men. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that, in women, a cut-off value of 0.97mg/l for cystatin C discriminated patients with severe CAC with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 77% (area under the curve, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.62-0.86; p<0.01). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that serum cystatin C was not associated with severe CAC in all patients and men, but this association was observed in women (OR: 7.80 for cystatin C≥0.97mg/l, 95% CI: 1.76-34.6, p<0.01).; Conclusion: Higher serum cystatin C levels are associated with greater CAC in women without CKD. Measurement of cystatin C may be useful for identifying women who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease.; Copyright © 2017 Japanese College of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate of Fetuin-A and Pentraxin3 (PTX3) as the main factors for vascular calcification and inflammation in hemodialysis (HD) and renal transplant (RT) patients.; Method: Serum was obtained from 45 stable chronic HD patients and 44 stable RT recipients. Biochemical factors, intact Parathormone, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), Fetuin-A and PTX3 levels were determined by standard methods.; Results: In the RT recipients PTX3 level was significantly higher than the HD patients [5.78(1.09-20.36) ng/mL vs. 1.65(0.24-7.89) ng/mL, p ≤ 0.001]. Serum Fetuin-A concentration was significantly higher in the HD compared to RT group [43.39(27.75-81.48) ng/mL vs. 38.76(22.26-89.07) ng/mL, p=0.020]. hsCRP level was also higher in the HD than the RT group [2.90(0.1-8.50) mg/L vs. 1.1(0.1-7.9) mg/L, p=0.003].; Conclusion: Although our study shows that serum PTX3 is increased and Fetuin-A is decreased after successful RT, their direct role on atherosclerosis needs further studies in the future.; Copyright © 2012 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

AB  - Background/aim: Fetuin-A, a circulating inhibitor of calcification, is a marker of inflammatory-nutritional state. We evaluated the association between serum fetuin-A levels and vascular calcification, intima-media thickness, and nutritional and inflammatory markers in different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD).; Materials and methods: CKD patients were sampled for calcium-phosphate parameters and nutritional and inflammatory markers [highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)], and serum fetuin-A levels. Intima-media thicknesses of the common carotid arteries (CIMT) were measured. Peripheral artery calcification scores were obtained.; Results: A total of 238 patients were included in the study. Fetuin-A levels in patients with end-stage renal disease were significantly lower than those in patients with stage-3 and stage-4 CKD (stage-5 vs. stage-4, P < 0.001; stage-5 vs. stage-3, P < 0.001). Fetuin-A was negatively correlated with creatinine (P < 0.001), Ca × P product (P < 0.001), hs-CRP (P = 0.01), vascular calcification score (P < 0.001), and CIMT (P < 0.001), and positively correlated with BMI (P < 0.001, r = 0.30) and serum albumin (P < 0.001).; Conclusion: Lower levels of fetuin-A were associated with higher vascular calcification scores, CIMT, hs-CRP levels, and lower BMI and albumin. Fetuin-A deficiency may be a key element for MIAC syndrome.;

AB  - Background: Both fetuin-A and hyperparathyroidism play crucial roles in vascular calcification (VC) and bone metabolism. However, the correlation between secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), parathyroidectomy (PTX) and fetuin-A levels in dialysis patients has not yet been studied.; Methods: For this study, we included 27 consecutive dialysis patients with severe SHPT who underwent total PTX with autotransplantation over a period of 2 years (from Oct 2006 to Sep 2008). Serum ionized calcium (iCa), phosphorus (Pi), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bAP), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and fetuin-A were checked basally and 2, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days after PTX.; Results: Two days after PTX, the iPTH, serum iCa, and Pi concentrations significantly decreased. Serum bAP levels gradually increased after PTX, peaked after 14 days (p < 0.05), and then gradually decreased. Serum fetuin-A levels significantly increased during the first 7 days after PTX, peaked 14 days after PTX (0.21 ± 0.05 vs. 0.35 ± 0.07 mg/ml, p < 0.05), and then remained at a stable level 60 days after PTX. There were significant correlations between percentage increase in serum fetuin-A levels and percentage decrease in serum iPTH levels 2 days and 7 days after PTX (r = 0.526, p < 0.01; r = 0.403, p < 0.05, respectively) and correlations between percentage increase in serum fetuin-A levels and percentage decrease in serum iCa levels 30 and 60 days after PTX (r = 0.449, p < 0.05; r = 0.474, p < 0.05, respectively).; Conclusions: Serum fetuin-A significantly increased after PTX in uremic patients with SHPT. The percentage increase in serum fetuin-A after PTX was closely correlated with the percentage decrease in serum iPTH levels immediately after PTX, and with the percentage decrease in serum iCa levels in the later stage after PTX. Further investigations are necessary to further understand the regulation of fetuin-A in dialysis patients with sSHPT.;

AB  - Aim: Vascular calcification is a cause of cardiovascular death in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23.; Methods: The enrolled study subjects were 127 (83 men and 44 women) HD patients. Calcification of the aortic arch was semiquantitatively estimated with a score (AoACS) on plain chest radiology. Change in AoACS (ΔAoACS) was obtained by subtracting the baseline AoACS value from the follow-up AoACS value. The second assessment was performed from 5 years after the first determination.; Results: The percentage of male gender in non-progressors (58.5%) was lesser than in regressors (60.0%) and progressors (74.6%). In addition, the dialysis duration in regressors (14.1±5.1 years) was shorter than in non-progressors (19.5±7.0 years) and progressors (16.8±7.5 years). Interestingly, the serum FGF-23 level in regressors (39225.5±9247.9 pg/mL) was significantly higher than in non-progressors (12896.5±26323.5 pg/mL) and progressors (14062.4±18456.8 pg/mL). Multi-ple regression analyses showed male gender (β value=0.969, F=5.092, p=0.0192), serum levels of albumin (β value=-1.395, F=4.541, p=0.0296) and log FGF-23 (β value=-0.001, F=7.273, p=0.0115) to be significant independent determinants of ΔAoACS.; Conclusion: Changes in AoAC evaluated by using a simple chest radiograph are associated with serum FGF-23 levels. Excess accumulation of FGF-23 in serum may enable to inhibit the calcification process in vessel walls in chronic HD patients.;

AB  - Background and Objectives: As a major component of uremic syndrome, cardiovascular disease is largely responsible for the high mortality observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies have evidenced an association between serum levels of indoxyl sulfate (IS, a protein-bound uremic toxin) and vascular alterations. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between serum IS, vascular calcification, vascular stiffness, and mortality in a cohort of CKD patients.; Design, Setting, Participants,& Measurements: One-hundred and thirty-nine patients (mean +/- SD age: 67 +/- 12; 60% male) at different stages of CKD (8% at stage 2, 26.5% at stage 3, 26.5% at stage 4, 7% at stage 5, and 32% at stage 5D) were enrolled.; Results: Baseline IS levels presented an inverse relationship with renal function and a direct relationship with aortic calcification and pulse wave velocity. During the follow-up period (605 +/- 217 d), 25 patients died, mostly because of cardiovascular events (n = 18). In crude survival analyses, the highest IS tertile was a powerful predictor of overall and cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.001 and 0.012, respectively). The predictive power of IS for death was maintained after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, albumin, hemoglobin, phosphate, and aortic calcification.; Conclusions: The study presented here indicates that IS may have a significant role in the vascular disease and higher mortality observed in CKD patients.;

AB  - Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of both divalent ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to possible biochemical differences between dialysis (D) and transplantation (Tx), we examined the entity and severity of these biochemical modifications and of coronary artery calcium score separately in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard markers of inflammation, divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin, matrix Gla protein (MGP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients (age 45 +/- 12 years; 30 males, 21 females; previous D duration 4.8 +/- 4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 +/- 5.5 years; Cr 1.8 +/- 0.6 mg/dl) and in 49 D patients (age 49 +/- 14 years; 30 males,19 females; D duration 5.6 +/- 4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium score (AS) was evaluated by cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx patients had better values of divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower prevalence (65 vs. 86%; p < 0.02) and severity (AS = 570 +/- 1,637 vs. 1,311 +/- 3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary calcification. In addition, a tendency toward normalization for all of the three calcification inhibitory proteins was evident. In both Tx and D, AS correlated with age and OPG (Tx: r(s) = 0.439, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: r(s) = 0.471, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.403, p < 0.005, respectively); in D patients, a correlation was present also with D duration (r(s) = 0.435; p < 0.002), other markers of inflammation and, notably, fetuin (r(s) = -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression analysis selected previous time on D in Tx patients (r(m) = 0.400; p < 0.004), and C-reactive protein and OPG in D patients (r(m) = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most predictive parameters of AS. Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age and D duration in the appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct risk condition. At variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS. In conclusion, as compared to D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of calcification inhibition proteins and of divalent ions closer to normal. As this is associated with a lower prevalence and severity of AS, it is suggested that Tx antagonize the accelerating role of D in the progression of vascular calcification. Assessment of both coronary calcifications and serum levels of calcification inhibitory proteins may be of value to identify those subjects at higher risk of development and progression of vascular lesions, among whom males have the highest rate.; 2007 S.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Statins (HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors) produce numerous non-lipid related, 'pleiotropic' effects. Our aim was to investigate whether simvastatin treatment affects serum levels of vascular calcification inhibitors, such as fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and osteopontin (OPN), in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).; Methods: A total of 98 statin-free patients with angiographically proven, newly diagnosed CAD were treated with simvastatin (20-40 mg daily) for 6 months to target a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level <100 mg/dL (the statin group [SG]). Thirty-five age- and sex-matched healthy individuals without any chronic metabolic or cardiovascular disease at baseline served as a healthy control group (HCG). Clinical, anthropometrical and metabolic parameters and serum fetuin-A, OPG, OPN and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were assayed at baseline in all participants and after 6 months only in SG patients.; Results: Compared with HCG subjects at baseline, SG patients exhibited higher serum levels of OPG (7.39 ± 2.94 pmol/L vs 2.47 ± 1.15 pmol/L, p < 0.001), OPN (60.99 ± 17.52 ng/mL vs 45.45 ± 10.26 ng/mL, p = 0.005) and hsCRP (4.66 ± 1.74 mg/L vs 1.58 ± 0.56 mg/L, p < 0.001) as well as lower serum levels of fetuin-A (0.222 ± 0.036 μg/L vs 0.839 ± 0.092 μg/L, p < 0001). Apart from significantly reducing plasma total cholesterol and LDL, simvastatin also reduced serum levels of fetuin-A (by ~62.6 %), OPG (by ~47.2 %), OPN (by ~44.6 %) and hsCRP (by ~45.3 %) (p < 0.05) in SG patients. In standard multiple regression analysis, the simvastatin-induced reduction in fetuin-A was independently associated with changes in total cholesterol (β = -0.289, p = 0.048) and LDL (β = -0.302, p = 0.032) (R (2) = 0.305, p = 0.040).; Conclusion: Patients with CAD showed derangements in serum levels of all vascular calcification inhibitors compared with those in healthy controls. Simvastatin treatment for 6 months significantly decreased serum fetuin-A, OPG and OPN levels, but the clinical relevance of this requires further investigation.;

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a high prevalence of vascular calcifications, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this population. Magnesium (Mg) depletion may be the missing link between multiple cardiovascular risk factors and the development of atherosclerosis. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship between serum Mg levels and vascular stiffness in children with CKD on regular hemodialysis (HD). The study included 25 children with CKD on regular HD in our center; the study included also 25 healthy children age-and sex-matched as a control group. Serum Mg levels were measured, and Doppler ultrasound assessment of the intima-media thickness (IMT) and the peak systolic velocities (PSVs) of the main arteries including the (aorta, carotid, and femoral) arteries were recorded in the study patients. There were significantly lower serum Mg levels in children on regular HD than in the controls (1.7 ± 0.43 mg/dL vs. 2.31 ± 0.12 mg/dL, respectively, P = 0.001). There was a significant increase in the aorta and carotid IMT in the study group than in the controls (0.45 ± 0.07 mm vs. 0.40 ± 0.09 mm; 0.98 ± 0.57 mm vs. 0.55 ± 0.1 mm, P = 0.034 and 0.001, respectively), whereas there were no significant differences regarding the PSV of the carotid, aorta, and femoral arteries between the study patients and the controls (P >0.05). A negative correlation was found between serum Mg level with aortic IMT (AIMT) (r = -0.682; P = 0.000). In addition, a significant negative correlation was found between the AIMT with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.447, P = 0.025, 0.472, P = 0.017), respectively. We conclude that lower serum Mg levels were associated with vascular calcification in chronic HD children. Confirmation of our results warrants further study.;

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in patients with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an important link between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between central arterial stiffness and serum OPG levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods: Blood samples were collected from 120 HD patients, and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured using a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of > 10 m/s was used to define the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into tertiles.; Results: Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high arterial stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure (p = 0.038), serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p <  0.001) levels and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels were significantly associated with greater height (p = 0.011), male gender (p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p = 0.020), and lower intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cfPWV value was independently associated with DM (β = 1.83, p = 0.008) and increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (β = 0.89 and 1.63 for tertile 2 and tertile 3, respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, in addition to age, DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for tertile 2; OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for trend = 0.002) were an independent predictor of high arterial stiffness in HD patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated with cfPWV value only in the highest OPG tertile group (r = 0.408, p = 0.009).; Conclusion: A positive association was detected between serum OPG levels and central arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high serum OPG levels may have greater influence of calcium load on central arterial stiffening.;

AB  - Background: Increasing evidence indicated that phosphorus emerged as an important cardiovascular risk factor in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The fact that serum phosphorus was closely linked to vascular and valvar calcification may account for one important reason. However, left ventricular remodeling may also serve as another potential mechanism of the cardiac toxicity of phosphorus. In the present study, we evaluated the association of serum phosphorus with left ventricular remodeling.; Methods: We investigated consecutive hospitalized patients with pre-dialysis CKD, who did not have symptomatic heart failure or take any phosphorus binder or calcitriol medications. Transthoracic echocardiography was applied to assess their left ventricular remodeling indices, both structural and functional.; Results: The 296 study subjects (mean age 56.4years) included 169 (57.1%) men, 203 (68.6%) hypertensive patients. In addition to gender, systolic blood pressure, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum phosphorus was an independent determinant of left ventricular mass index (LVMI, P=0.001). Similarly, serum phosphorus was also a determinant of left ventricular end diastolic dimension (P=0.0003), but not of relative wall thickness. In multivariate logistic analyses, serum phosphorus was significantly and independently associated with the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, odds ratio [OR] 2.38 for each 1mmol/L increase, 95% CI 1.20-4.75, P=0.01). Moreover, the association was only confirmatory in eccentric LVH (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.43-6.32, P=0.003) but not in concentric LVH (1.38, 95% CI, 0.54-3.49, P=0.50).; Conclusion: Serum phosphorus was significantly and independently associated with LVMI and the prevalence of eccentric LVH in hospitalized patients with CKD.; Copyright © 2016.

AB  - Background/aim: Vascular calcification is common and contributes to increased cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this prospective study, we aimed to investigate the associations of serum S100A12 in the presence of severe coronary artery calcification (CAC) and the progression of CAC in HD patients.; Methods: Sixty maintenance HD patients and 30 controls were enrolled. Serum S100A12 levels were measured using ELISA. CAC scores (CACs) were measured twice at a 4-year interval using multislice spiral CT. The HD patients were classified as rapid progressors or slow progressors according to the change in the CACs across these 2 measurements (x0394;CACs).; Results: The incidences of rapid progression of CAC in patients with baseline CACs ≤10, CACs >10 and CACs >400 were 12.5, 40.0 and 64.3%, respectively. Both baseline and 4-year serum S100A12 levels were significantly higher in the rapid progressors than in the slow progressors (medians of 45.6 vs. 30.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001 and 62.3 vs. 39.4 ng/ml, p = 0.002, respectively). The serum S100A12 levels were significantly correlated with baseline CACs (r = 0.466, p < 0.001), 4-year CACs (r = 0.440, p < 0.001) and x0394;CACs (r = 0.392, p < 0.001). Importantly, the x0394;CACs were significantly correlated with x0394;S100A12 levels (r = 0.396, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the serum S100A12 level was as an independent determinant of the presence of severe CAC and that the increment in the serum S100A12 level was a factor that was significantly independently associated with the progression of CAC.; Conclusions: Serum S100A12 levels were significantly associated with the presence of severe CAC, and the increment in serum S100A12 levels was an independent determinant of the progression of CAC.; © 2015 S.

AB  - Background: Sclerostin (Scl) has recently emerged as a novel marker of bone remodeling and vascular calcification. However, whether high circulating Scl is also a risk factor for death is not well established. The purpose of this study was to test whether serum Scl would be associated with mortality.; Methods: we measured serum Scl in a hemodialysis patients' cohort, which was followed during a ten-year period. Competing risk regression models were applied, as during the follow-up, patients were exposed to both events kidney transplant and death.; Results: Ninety-one patients aged 42.3±18.8 years (55% of male gender, 15% of diabetes) were included. During the follow-up, 32 patients underwent kidney transplant and 26 patients died. Non-survivals presented higher FGF23, higher Scl and lower creatinine. There was an association between all-cause mortality and higher Scl (HR=2.2), higher age (HR=1.04) and presence of diabetes (HR=2.27), by competing risk analyses. Even including potential markers of mortality, as creatinine, FGF 23, and gender, Scl, age and diabetes remained significantly related to higher mortality.; Conclusion: Serum Scl is an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis patients. However, whether clinical interventions to modulate Scl would be able to improve these patients survival needs to be determined.;

AB  - Aims: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-5b and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are specific and sensitive markers of bone resorption in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The TRACP-5b level is associated with the severity of RA and CKD, while the OPG level is associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and calcification, and can predict a poor outcome in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the impact of TRACP-5b on coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients remains unclear.; Methods: A total of 71 CAD patients (57 men, 14 women; mean age: 69.0±9.7 years) and 28 age- and gender- matched healthy subjects were investigated. The number of diseased vessels (a marker of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis) and the Gensini score (a marker of the extent of coronary atherosclerosis), as well as the OPG and TRACP-5b levels were measured in CAD patients. The TRACP-5b levels were classified into quartiles.; Results: The TRACP-5b levels were significantly higher in CAD patients than in healthy subjects. Patients with higher TRACP-5b levels had higher OPG levels and Gensini scores than those with lower TRACP-5b levels. Higher TRACP-5b levels were associated with an increased number of diseased vessels. A multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the OPG level and the number of diseased vessels or the Gensini score were significantly and independently associated with the TRACP-5b level.; Conclusions: These data indicate that the TRACP-5b level is significantly associated with the OPG level and with the severity and extent of coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients.;

AB  - Background: Apoe-deficient (Apoe-/-) mice develop progressive atherosclerotic lesions with age but no severe renal pathology in the absence of additional challenges. We recently described accelerated atherosclerosis as well as marked renal injury in Apoe-/- mice deficient in the mesenchymal integrin chain Itga8 (Itga8-/-). Here, we used this Apoe-/-, Itga8-/- mouse model to investigate the sex differences in the development of atherosclerosis and concomitant renal injury. We hypothesized that aging female mice are protected from vascular and renal damage in this mouse model.; Methods: Apoe-/- mice were backcrossed with Itga8-/- mice. Mice were kept on a normal diet. At the age of 12 months, the aortae and kidneys of male and female Apoe-/-Itga8+/+ mice or Apoe-/-Itga8-/- mice were studied. En face preparations of the aorta were stained with Sudan IV (lipid deposition) or von Kossa (calcification). In kidney tissue, immunostaining for collagen IV, CD3, F4/80, and PCNA and real-time PCR analyses for Il6, Vegfa, Col1a1 (collagen I), and Ssp1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1, synonym osteopontin) as well as ER stress markers were performed.; Results: When compared to male mice, Apoe-/-Itga8+/+ female mice had a lower body weight, equal serum cholesterol levels, and lower triglyceride levels. However, female mice had increased aortic lipid deposition and more aortic calcifications than males. Male Apoe-/- mice with the additional deficiency of Itga8 developed increased serum urea, glomerulosclerosis, renal immune cell infiltration, and reduced glomerular cell proliferation. In females of the same genotype, these renal changes were less pronounced and were accompanied by lower expression of interleukin-6 and collagen I, while osteopontin expression was higher and markers of ER stress were not different.; Conclusions: In this model of atherosclerosis, the female sex is a risk factor to develop more severe atherosclerotic lesions, even though serum fat levels are higher in males. In contrast, female mice are protected from renal damage, which is accompanied by attenuated inflammation and matrix deposition. Thus, sex affects vascular and renal injury in a differential manner.;

AB  - Aim: Vascular calcification, which significantly increases cardiovascular and other causes of mortality, is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between serum magnesium levels and vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.; Methods: 390 nondiabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis (226 males and 164 females, 59 +/- 13 years) were examined. Hand roentgenography was performed in each patient, and visible vascular calcification of the hand arteries was evaluated. Blood was drawn to measure serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium and intact parathyroid hormone levels.; Results: There were 52 patients (38 males and 14 females) with vascular calcification, and 338 (188 males and 150 females) without. Serum phosphate was significantly higher in the former compared with the latter group (p < 0.005); serum intact parathyroid hormone was significantly higher (p < 0.05), whereas serum calcium was not statistically different between the two groups. Serum magnesium was significantly lower in patients with vascular calcification than in those without (2.69 +/- 0.28 vs. 2.78 +/- 0.33 mg/dl, p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that serum magnesium concentration was a significant independent factor associated with the presence of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients (odds ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 - 0.92/1 mg/dl increase in serum magnesium, p = 0.036) after adjustment for age, gender, duration of hemodialysis, calcium, phosphate and intact parathyroid hormone concentrations.; Conclusion: Hypomagnesemia is significantly associated with the presence of vascular calcification of the hand arteries, independent of serum calcium and phosphate levels. These results suggest that higher serum magnesium concentrations may play an important protective role in the development of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients, and that magnesium concentration of dialysis fluid may be reconsidered in view of preventing vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification often occurs in patients with uremia. As osteopontin (OPN) is not only involved in the physiological but also the pathological calcification of tissues, OPN may be associated with the pathogenesis of aortic calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods: We examined the expression of OPN in atherosclerotic aortas of HD patients. In addition, we performed a prospective longitudinal study by using CT scans to detect aortic calcifications and by measuring the plasma OPN concentration by ELISA in HD patients (20 men, 16 women; mean age 55.2 +/- 21.3 years) and in healthy volunteers (18 men, 17 women; mean age 54.0 +/- 13.2 years).; Results: By immunohistochemical staining, OPN was abundantly localized in atherosclerotic plaques of HD patients. The macrophages surrounding the atheromatous plaques were identified as the OPN-expressing cells. We furthermore found that the concentration of soluble plasma OPN was significantly higher in HD patients as compared with the concentrations in age-matched healthy volunteers (837.3 +/- 443.2 vs. 315.1 +/- 117.4 ng/ml, p < 0.01). The OPN concentration was positively correlated with the aortic calcification index in HD patients (r = 0.749, p < 0.01).; Conclusion: These data suggest that OPN, secreted by macrophages, plays a role in the calcification of atheromatous plaques in HD patients.; Copyright 2001 S.

AB  - Background: Reduced soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) levels follow declining renal function, are strongly associated with endothelial dysfunction and predict cardiovascular events in nondialyzed chronic kidney disease patients. In contrast, elevated levels of sTWEAK predict poor survival in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recent evidence suggests a role for sTWEAK in the pathophysiology of vascular calcification. The aim of the study was to investigate plausible links between sTWEAK, atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and vascular calcification in HD patients.; Methods: Coronary artery calcification score (CACs) determined by multislice computed tomography, arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) by carotid Doppler ultrasonography were assessed in 131 long-term prevalent HD patients. sTWEAK levels were measured by ELISA (Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria).; Results: Mean serum sTWEAK level was 237.0 ± 147.5 pg/mL (range 78-937). sTWEAK level was inversely correlated with CA-IMT at a borderline significance (r=-0.168, p=0.05). Neither carotid-radial PWV nor carotid-femoral PWV values correlated with sTWEAK. sTWEAK level was higher in patients with severe vascular calcification (CACs ≥400) compared to patients with CACs <400 (264.5 ± 146.8 pg/mL vs. 205.04 ± 122.4 pg/mL, p=0.02).The association between sTWEAK and vascular calcification persisted after multivariate adjustment.; Conclusions: There exists a weak inverse correlation between sTWEAK and carotid atherosclerosis and a positive correlation with coronary artery calcification in long-term HD patients. Our data give support for a role for sTWEAK in the pathogenesis of vascular injury in HD patients.;

AB  - Background: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), also known as calciphylaxis, is characterized by vascular calcification, thrombosis and intense inflammation. Prior research has shown that statins have anticalcification, antithrombotic and antiinflammatory properties; however, the association between statin use and CUA has not been investigated.; Methods: This matched case-control study included 62 adult maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients with biopsy-confirmed CUA diagnosed between the years 2002 and 2011 (cases). All cases were hospitalized at the time of diagnosis. Controls (n = 124) were hospitalized maintenance HD patients without CUA (matched to cases by gender and timing of hospitalization). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to compute odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CUA in statin users, and also to examine previously described associations.; Results: The mean age of cases was 58 years. Most were females (68%), and of white race (64%). Statin use was more common in controls than in cases (39 vs. 19%, p < 0.01). Statin use was associated with lower odds of CUA in unadjusted (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.79) and adjusted (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.88) analyses. Hypercalcemia (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.14-4.43), hypoalbuminemia (OR 5.73, 95% CI 2.79-11.77), calcitriol use (OR 5.69, 95% CI 1.02-31.77) and warfarin use (OR 4.30, 95% CI 1.57-11.74) were positively associated with CUA in adjusted analyses whereas paricalcitol and doxercalciferol were not (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.54-3.27).; Conclusion: Statin use may be negatively associated with odds of CUA. Further large prospective studies with attention to potential confounders are needed to confirm these findings.; Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Kidney stone disease is associated with cardiovascular outcomes; it is unclear whether stone composition is associated with differential cardiovascular risk. To analyze such association, we performed a cross-sectional study in which data were collected for patients who underwent at least one stone composition analysis from January 01 2015 to May 30 2018. The original dataset was linked with the imaging database to identify those patients with at least one abdominal CT scan examination during the period of interest. In total, 180 patients were included. The outcome of interest was the presence of any abdominal aortic calcifications (AAC) computed from CT scans. There were 108 (60.0%) patients with AAC. Calcium phosphate content was associated directly with eGFR, inversely with age, and was higher among females. Uric acid content was associated directly with age and inversely with eGFR, was higher among males, patients with diabetes and high blood pressure. After adjustment for age and gender, there was a significant association between calcium phosphate content and AAC (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00, 1.56, p = 0.045). No interaction by gender was found between calcium phosphate content and AAC (p = 0.84). In conclusion, we demonstrated a significant direct association of AAC and the amount of calcium phosphate was found, suggesting an increased cardiovascular risk. Our study suggests that some subtypes of kidney stone disease deserve a closer cardiovascular risk assessment.;

AB  - We aim to evaluate the disturbances in mineral metabolism, abnormalities in bone mineral density (BMD), and extraskeletal calcification in newly detected, untreated predialysis stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at a tertiary care hospital in North India. This is cross-sectional observational study. A total of 95 (68 males, 27 females) newly detected patients underwent clinical evaluation, biochemical assessment [serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D)], BMD measurement (at spine, hip, and forearm) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), lateral abdominal radiograph [for abdominal aortic calcification (AAC)], skeletal survey (to look for any abnormality including fractures), and echocardiography [for any cardiac valvular calcification (CVC)]. Symptoms related to CKD-mineral bone disorder were seen in 33.6% of the study patients. Prevalence of hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hypovitaminosis D was 64.2%, 81.1%, 49.5%, and 89.5%, respectively. CVC was seen in 22.1% of patients on echocardiography, mostly involving the mitral valve. Patients with CVC were more likely to be males and smokers. There was no significant difference in iPTH levels between patients with or without CVC. AAC was seen in 10.5% of patients on lateral abdominal X-ray. Patients with AAC had higher levels of iPTH, phosphorus, and ALP and lower levels of calcium compared to patients without AAC. BMD by DXA showed a low bone mass in 41.05% of our patients and was more prevalent in CKD stage 5. Most of the study patients had hyperparathyroidism and low 25(OH)D levels. Our study shows that newly detected, naïve Indian CKD patients have a high prevalence of disturbances of mineral metabolism including hyperparathyroidism, Vitamin D deficiency, abnormal BMD, and valvular and vascular calcification, even before initiating dialysis.;

AB  - Background/aims: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis (HD) patients and the relationship between seasonal variations in vitamin D levels and vascular calcification.; Methods: As a prospective observational study, we analyzed 289 HD patients. We have assessed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels at the end of the summer (September) and winter (March) and analyzed the data to reveal the association of serum 25D level with vascular calcification scores (VCS) at the end of the summer, when vitamin D levels were found to peak. Plan X-ray images of lateral lumbar spine from all subjects were studied for calculation of semiquantitative VCS as described by Kauppila.; Results: The prevalence of 25D deficiency was 86.2% at the end of the summer and increased to 96.2% at the end of the winter. Female gender and diabetes were associated with vitamin D deficiency. According to univariate analysis, 25D levels were inversely related to vascular calcification. However, after correcting for confounding factors, this relationship lost statistical significance. Multivariate analysis showed that age, systolic blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol levels were directly associated with a higher VCS.; Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in HD patients with marked seasonal variation. However, low 25D levels could not be identified as an independent predictor of vascular calcification in these patients.; Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: An increase in aortic stiffness, as reflected by an increase in pulse wave velocity (PWV) or aortic augmentation index (AI) is an important predictor of cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. Dysregulation of calcification inhibitors, such as fetuin-A, is involved in vascular pathology in dialysis patients and fetuin-A is inversely related to mortality in dialysis patients. In this study, the relation between serum fetuin-A concentration and parameters of aortic stiffness was investigated in patients with end-stage renal disease.; Methods: In a cross-sectional study we included 131 dialysis patients, aged 62+/-14 years (33 on peritoneal dialysis and 98 on haemodialysis), and 41 controls, aged 60+/-8 years. Time-averaged pre-dialysis values of serum albumin, Ca, P and intact parathyroid hormone were included in multiregression analysis, as were high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fetuin-A, age, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and dialysis modality. PWV and AI were measured with the SphygmoCor device.; Results: Mean fetuin-A concentration in dialysis patients (0.63+/-0.16 g/l) did not differ from controls (0.63+/-0.11 g/l). Median hsCRP levels in dialysis patients were higher compared with controls (4.0 vs 1.9 mg/l; P<0.0001). PWV but not AI was higher in dialysis patients than in controls (9.9 vs 7.9 m/s; P<0.0001). In univariate analysis in dialysis patients, fetuin-A levels were inversely related to both PWV (r = - 0.25, P = 0.007) and AI (r = - 0.26, P = 0.006), respectively. However, after correction for age, gender, MAP and diabetes mellitus, this relation lost statistical significance.; Conclusions: In a dialysis population with a relatively low level of inflammatory activity, the soluble calcification inhibitor fetuin-A could not be identified as an independent predictor of aortic stiffness as measured with PWV and AI.;

AB  - Background: Atherosclerotic artery disease is a common condition in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, there are few published data on the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in nondialyzed patients with renal insufficiency. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a simple, noninvasive, and reliable method to assess PAD.; Methods and Results: Prevalence of PAD using ABI was investigated in 102 patients referred for the first time to a nephrology clinic with CKD in stages 3 to 5 of the K/DOQI classification, and with no previous diagnosis of PAD. Patients with ABI <0.9 were considered positive for PAD. A total of 64% of the patients were male. The mean age was 70 +/- 11 (range 58-84) years, and the estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 35 +/- 12 (range 6-59) mL/min(-1). Of the total sample, 26% were diabetics, 10% active smokers, 48% ex-smokers, and 29% had a diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD), 15% had been previously diagnosed of stroke, and 17% had signs and symptoms compatible with intermittent claudication, which had passed unnoticed. Thirty-two percent of patients had an ABI <0.9 (mean 0.64 +/- 0.25). Of these patients with PAD, 84% were men (P < 0.005), and only 30% presented a clinical picture compatible with intermittent claudication. Absolute risk of CHD according to the Framingham 1998 score was higher in the PAD group (19.3% +/- 6 vs. 13.1% +/- 8; P= 0.01). Patients with PAD were older (75 +/- 6 vs. 66 +/- 11 years, P= 0.000), and had worse renal function (CrCl 30.8 +/- 12 vs. 37 +/- 10.7 mL.min(-1), P= 0.016) compared to patients without PAD, but no differences were found in cholesterol levels (total, HDL, LDL), calcium, phosphorus, or PTH. In the logistic regression analysis, independent indicators of PAD risk were male sex, age, and lower CrCl. Twelve percent of patients had an ABI > or =1.3, suggestive of parietal arterial calcifications. In these patients, systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure were lower (126 +/- 18 vs. 150 +/- 27, P= 0.005, and 52 +/- 13 vs. 68 +/- 25 mm Hg, P= 0.044), i-PTH levels were higher (228 +/- 267 vs. 117 +/- 63 pg/mL, P= 0.01), and a larger proportion of this group was treated with calcitriol (34% vs. 13%) compared to patients with a normal ABI.; Conclusion: A high prevalence of PAD, considered as an ABI <0.9, was demonstrated in nondialyzed patients with CKD. This was related with age, male sex, and higher degree of renal insufficiency, while the presence of ABI > or =1.3 was associated with a greater degree of hyperparathyroidism. These data show the need to carry out routine ABI determinations in patients with CKD for early detection of peripheral arterial disease.;

AB  - Aims: Vitamin K deficiency is known to be common in haemodialysis patients and associates with adverse outcomes in this population, particularly vascular calcification. We aimed to investigate the vitamin K status in a population of Chinese haemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods: We collected demographic and biochemical data from a population of maintenance HD (MHD) patients in our unit and a control group composed of healthy subjects from our outpatient clinic. Fasting serum samples from all subjects were collected for the measurement of known vitamin K-dependent proteins i.e. matrix Gla protein (MGP), osteocalcin (OC) and uncarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC). We also quantified the fraction of ucOC to total OC (%ucOC). Differences of these parameters between groups were analyzed and risk factors of vitamin K deficiency based on the definition as per %ucOC were investigated.; Results: We enrolled 93 MHD patients as a test group and 93 healthy subjects as a control group. There was no significant difference in MGP between groups (4.0 ± 2.8 pg/mL in MHD vs 4.2 ± 1.2 pg/mL in control; P = 0.676). Mean %ucOC was significantly greater in the MHD patients as compared to control subjects (76.4 ± 20.0% in MHD vs 48.56 ± 15.5%; P < 0.001). Time on dialysis and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level appeared to be indicators of vitamin K deficiency, with the former being an independent risk factor.; Conclusions: Defining Vitamin K deficiency by %ucOC, suboptimal vitamin K levels appear common in Chinese MHD patients. Time on dialysis and LDL cholesterol level predict vitamin K deficiency.; © 2015 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Extracranial superficial temporal artery (STA) calcification is an unusual finding seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and has unknown ramifications with respect to intracranial ischemic disease. We sought to determine the association between the risk factors for vascular calcification and this rare phenomenon, in patients with chronic renal failure, and to assess the coexistence of cerebral ischemia.; Materials and Methods: Medical records and laboratory data on risk factors for vascular calcification were retrospectively retrieved for 453 patients with a discharge diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). CT head examinations were reviewed to identify and associate STA calcification with 1) risk factors for the vascular calcification, 2) intracranial artery calcification, and 3) cerebral ischemia (white matter and/or cortical ischemic changes).; Results: STA calcification was present in 9.9% (45/453) of the studied cohort. The prevalence of cerebral ischemia was 24.4% (11/45) in patients with STA calcification and 9.3% (38/408) in patients without it. Diabetes mellitus (OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.059-6.208; P=0.037) was independently associated with the risk of STA calcification. The risk of cerebral ischemia, however, was not related to STA calcification (P=0.221).; Conclusion: The presence of diabetes mellitus is important in describing the risk of STA calcification in patients with ESRD, whereas age, gender, hypertension, serum calcium, serum phosphate, or serum hemoglobin levels are not. The risk of cerebral ischemia is not related to STA calcification but has the strongest association with diabetes mellitus.;

AB  - OBJECTIVE The authors recently reported that the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or extended abdominal aortic calcification was associated with significantly worse clinical outcomes after posterior lumbar interbody fusion. CKD is one of the highest risk factors for systemic atherosclerosis. Therefore, impaired blood flow due to atherosclerosis could exacerbate degeneration of the cervical spine and neural tissue. However, there has been no report of a study evaluating the deleterious effects of CKD and atherosclerosis on the outcomes after decompression surgery for cervical compression myelopathy. The purpose of this study was thus to examine whether CKD and systemic atherosclerosis affect surgical outcomes after laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). METHODS The authors analyzed data from 127 consecutive cases involving patients who underwent laminoplasty for CSM and met their inclusion criteria. Stage 3-4 CKD was present as a preoperative comorbidity in 44 cases. Clinical status was assessed using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) cervical myelopathy evaluation questionnaire before surgery and 2 years postoperatively. As a marker of systemic atherosclerosis, the presence of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) was assessed on preoperative chest radiographs. RESULTS AoAC was found on preoperative chest radiographs in 40 of 127 patients. Neither CKD nor AoAC had a statistically significant deleterious effect on preoperative JOA score. However, CKD and AoAC were significantly associated with reductions in both the JOA score recovery rate (mean 36.1% in patients with CKD vs 44.7% in those without CKD; 26.0% in patients with AoAC vs 48.9% in those without AoAC) and the change in JOA score at 2 years after surgery (mean 2.3 points in patients with CKD vs 3.1 points in those without CKD; 2.1 points for patients with AoAC vs 3.2 points for those without AoAC). A multivariate regression analysis showed that AoAC was a significant independent predictor of poor outcome with respect to both for the difference between follow-up and preoperative JOA scores and the JOA score recovery rate. CONCLUSIONS CKD and AoAC were associated with increased rates of poor neurological outcomes after laminoplasty for CSM, and AoAC was a significant independent predictive factor for poor outcome.;

AB  - Background: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPTH) is highly prevalent among persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). SHPTH has been linked to uremic bone disease, vascular calcification, and a higher risk of death. Parathyroidectomy (PTX) can dramatically reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) and phosphate levels; however, the relationship between PTX and survival is not known.; Methods: We conducted an observational matched cohort study utilizing data from the United States Renal Database System (USRDS) in which 4558 patients undergoing a first PTX while on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis were individually matched by age, race, gender, cause of ESRD, dialysis duration, prior transplantation status, and dialysis modality to 4558 control patients who did not undergo PTX. Patients were followed from the date of PTX until they died or were lost to follow-up.; Results: The 30-day postoperative mortality rate following PTX was 3.1%. Long-term relative risks of death among patients undergoing PTX were estimated to be 10% to 15% lower than those of matched control patients not undergoing surgery. Survival curves between the 2 groups crossed 587 days following PTX. Median survival was 53.4 months (95% CI: 51.2-56.4) in the PTX group, and 46.8 months (95% CI: 44.7-48.9) in the control group.; Conclusion: PTX was associated with higher short-term, and lower long-term, mortality rates among U.S. patients receiving chronic dialysis. Measures to attenuate SHPTH may play an important role in reducing mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease.;

AB  - Introduction: Arterial stiffness is a risk marker for cardiovascular events. In this study we aimed to compare the effect on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and mammalian Target of Rapamycine inhibitors (mTORi) on arterial stiffness in renal transplant patients.; Patients and Methods: 81 renal transplant patients under CNI-based or mTORi-based protocol for at least 6 months were included in the study. Arterial stiffness was measured by using the SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia). Vitamin K-dependent, calcification inhibitor matrix Gla protein (MGP) concentrations were quantified by ELISA methods (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria).; Results: 34 patients were on mTORi-based and 47 on CNI-based immunosuppression. Mean age was 37.9 ± 10.8 (18 - 71) years and 45% were female. Age, gender, graft functions and follow-up period of the groups were similar. Augmentation index was 15.2 ± 12.6% in CNI and 18.8 ± 14.0% in mTORi groups (p > 0.05). There was no difference regarding carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity between groups. Arterial stiffness was positively correlated with age, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and proteinuria. MGP levels were higher in the mTORi group but were not predictors for carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity.; Conclusion: Rather than specific immunosuppressive drug effects, conventional risk factors, blood pressure and proteinuria are the most important predictors for arterial stiffness in renal transplant patients.;

AB  - Background: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is associated with high incidences of cardiovascular disease, bone fracture, and mortality. This study was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of cinacalcet treatment on chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) markers in chronic hemodialysis patients with severe SHPT.; Methods: In phase 1, 30 adult HD patients were randomized to cinacalcet or control groups for 12 weeks to explore the achievement of >30% reduction of iPTH. In phase 2, 45 patients were participated to further explore the effect of cinacalcet on CKD-MBD parameters for 24-week follow up and 12 additional weeks after cinacalcet discontinuation.; Results: In phase 1, the baseline serum iPTH levels were not different [1374 (955, 1639) pg/mL in the control group vs. 1191 (1005, 1884) pg/mL in the cinacalcet group], the percentage of patients achieving iPTH target were significantly higher in the treatment group [80% vs. 13%, p = .001]. In phase 2, the significant reductions of iPTH, FGF-23, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, and slightly decreased size of parathyroid gland and stabilized vascular calcification were observed at 24-week follow up and markedly rebounded after discontinuation of cinacalcet.; Conclusions: The effectiveness of cinacalcet were still obviously demonstrated even in chronic HD patients with severe SHPT. In addition, the improvements of bone markers and FGF-23, and stabilization of vascular calcification were observed. Therefore, cinacalcet can provide salutary effects on CKD-MBD in severe SHPT and might be an initially effective PTH-lowering therapy prior to surgical parathyroidectomy as well as an alternative treatment in the patients unsuitable for surgery.; Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02056730.

AB  - Objectives: We compared the correlation of regulatory T cell (Treg) and Th17 cell function disequilibrium with calcification in uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) with healthy controls, and investigated if their influence possibly increased the development and outcome of cardiovascular complications in uremic patients after MHD.; Methods: The extent of coronary artery calcification was assessed by coronary artery calcification scoring (CACS) in uremic patients with and without adverse cardiovascular events after MHD (MHD group 1 vs. MHD group 2, respectively). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with rhBMP-2 as positive control. The Treg/Th17 cell frequencies, Foxp3 ROR-gt mRNA expressions, and MIP 3α/CCL20 concentrations were measured.; Results: The CACS score was significantly higher in MHD group 1 as compared group 2. In comparison with controls, rhBMP-2 upregulates Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium in uremic patients, displayed higher Treg and Th17 frequencies, Foxp3 and ROR-gt expressions, and MIP3α/CCL20 concentrations. However, the up-regulations of Treg frequencies and Foxp3 expressions were significant in controls but not in MHD patients. It was also observed that Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium was not only correlated with rhBMP-2 state but also consistent with the cardiovascular complications. Moreover, the CACS was negatively correlated with Treg cell frequencies but positively correlated with Th17 cell frequencies and MIP3a/CCL20 concentrations.; Conclusions: Function disequilibrium of Treg/Th17 was related to the degree of the rhBMP-2 state. Function disequilibrium of the Treg/Th17 might act synergistically with rhBMP-2 in the high incidence of immune-mediated cardiovascular complications after MHD.;

AB  - Background: We recently determined that in hemodialysis patients, the use of calcium salts to correct hyperphosphatemia led to progressive coronary artery and aortic calcification as determined by sequential electron beam tomography (EBT) while the use of the non-calcium-containing binder sevelamer did not. Whether the specific calcium preparation (acetate vs. carbonate) might influence the likelihood of progressive calcification was debated.; Methods: To determine whether treatment with calcium acetate was specifically associated with hypercalcemia and progressive vascular calcification, we conducted an analysis restricted to 108 hemodialysis patients randomized to calcium acetate or sevelamer and followed for one year.; Results: The reduction in serum phosphorus was roughly equivalent with both agents (calcium acetate -2.5 +/- 1.8 mg/dl vs. sevelamer -2.8 +/- 2.0 mg/dl, p = 0.53). Subjects given calcium acetate were more likely to develop hypercalcemia (defined as an albumin-corrected serum calcium > or =10.5 mg/dl) (36 vs. 13%, p = 0.015). Treatment with calcium acetate (mean 4.6 +/- 2.1 g/day - equivalent to 1.2 +/- 0.5 g of elemental calcium) led to a significant increase in EBT-determined calcification of the coronary arteries (mean change 182 +/- 350, median change +20, p = 0.002) and aorta (mean change 181 +/- 855, median change +73, p < 0.0001). These changes were similar in magnitude to those seen with calcium carbonate. There were no significant changes in calcification among sevelamer-treated subjects.; Conclusion: Despite purported differences in safety and efficacy relative to calcium carbonate, calcium acetate led to hypercalcemia and progressive vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.; Copyright 2003 S.

AB  - Background: Glucose transporters mediate the facilitative uptake of glucose into cells, with GLUT-1 being the predominant isoform in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC). Clones of human cells overexpressing the GLUT-1 transporter showed a high increase in intracellular glucose concentrations, mimicking the diabetic milieu. It is possible that high intracellular glucose together with uremic factors may play an important role in vascular calcification by transforming VSMC into osteoblast-like cells. The XbaI polymorphism in the GLUT-1 gene has been linked to variations in GLUT-1 expression, with consequent changes in intracellular glucose concentration.; Methods: To assess the association between the GLUT-1 XbaI gene polymorphism and the presence of VC in nondiabetic uremic patients, a total of 105 nondiabetic patients on hemodialysis were studied. VC were evaluated by conventional simple X-ray. Mean values of serum calcium, phosphorous, cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, PTH and insulin were measured. Height, weight, BMI and waist circumference were also determined. The GLUT-1 XbaI polymorphism in the second intron of the gene was ascertained by means of the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on DNA isolated from peripheral blood DNA. In the absence of an XbaI site, a fragment of 305 bp was seen (so-called x allele), whereas fragments of 232 and 73 bp were generated if the XbaI site was present (X allele).; Results: Genotype distribution in all patients was similar to the Caucasian population. However, when the patients were grouped according to the presence or absence of VC, there were marked differences in the frequency of the GLUT1 genotypes: the xx GLUT-1 genotype was more prevalent in the group with VC (30.7 vs. 4.5%, p = 0.001). Stepwise logistic regression demonstrated that the xx GLUT-1 genotype was independently associated with the presence of VC after adjusting for other variables such as age, calcium x phosphrus product, BMI and time on dialysis (OR 7.68; 95% CI 1.28-45.7).; Conclusions: GLUT-1 XbaI gene polymorphism is associated with vascular calcifications in nondiabetic uremic patients.; Copyright  2008 S.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Endotoxin (ET) is recognized to cause adverse effects on cardiovascular (CV) structure. Circulatory translocation of gut bacterial ET is described in heart failure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older people and aggressive BP control is the cornerstone of management. We therefore studied ET after improvement of the overall CV milieu with introduction of optimized antihypertensive therapy (AHT).; Design, Setting, Participants,& Measurements: We recruited 40 hypertensive nondiabetic patients (≥70 years) with CKD stages 3 and 4 and hypertensive non-CKD matched controls. Assessment was performed after complete AHT washout and repeated after AHT reintroduction to target BP 130/80 mmHg. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and analysis were assessed by applanation tonometry, central hemodynamics by continuous digital pulse wave analysis, vascular calcification (VC) by superficial femoral artery CT, and serum ET by Limulus Amebocyte assay.; Results: Mean age was 76 ± 5 years, estimated GFR (eGFR) (CKD group) was 40 ± 14 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and achieved BP was 128/69 mmHg. Washout ET was 0.042 ± 0.011 EU/ml and was independent of renal function, gender, age, BP, VC, arterial stiffness, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. ET significantly decreased with AHT (to 0.020 ± 0.028 EU/ml; P < 0.001) and was associated with eGFR (R = -0.38; P = 0.02), arterial wave reflection (Augmentation Index R = -0.42; P = 0.01), and degree of tonic vasodilatation (total peripheral resistance R = -0.37; P = 0.03), but not VC, PWV, gender, age, BP, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.; Conclusions: Elderly patients with hypertension have elevated serum ET. Improvement of their CV status with optimized AHT is associated with a significant reduction in endotoxemia. Further investigation of the potential pathophysiological mechanisms linking CV disease and CKD with this previously unappreciated effect of AHT appears warranted.;

AB  - Coronary calcification (CCA) is one of the independent predictors for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) in coronary intervention. Post-marketing surveillance study Japan is a prospective registry designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the everolimus-eluting stent (EES, XIENCE V/PROMUS Stent) in routine clinical practice at 47 centers. In this study, 1848 lesions (1546 patients) were assessed using quantitative coronary angiography. In these 1546 patients, renal function data were unknown in 26 patients. Three patients in 70 patients with dialysis and 56 patients in 1450 patients with no dialysis were excluded, because they had multiple lesions with mixed calcification lesions. We evaluated the effects of CCA on 8-month angiographic and 3-year clinical outcomes in dialysis and non-dialysis patients. Moderate-to-severe (Ca group) and none-to-mild CCA (non-Ca group) were observed in 33 lesions (30 patients) and 48 lesions (37 patients) in dialysis patients, and these were observed in 306 lesions (286 patients) and 1303 lesions (1108 patients) in non-dialysis patients, respectively. In non-dialysis patients, the ischemic-driven target lesion revascularization (ID-TLR) and MACE rate over the 3 years were significantly higher in the Ca group than in the non-Ca group (5.8 vs. 3.1%, p = 0.025 and 10.0 vs. 5.0%, p = 0.0011). In dialysis patients, ID-TLR and MACE rates were high in both groups (14.3 vs. 17.9%, p = 0.85 and 17.5 vs. 36.1%, p = 0.16). In non-dialysis patients, 8-month angiographic and 3-year clinical outcomes were worse in the Ca group. However, in dialysis patients, both outcomes were worse regardless of CCA.Clinical Trial registration https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01086228 .;

AB  - Background/aims: This cross-sectional study was designed to assess the relationship between vascular stiffness (VS) and bone-related proteins involved in the development of arteriosclerosis in patients on regular hemodialysis (HD).; Methods: 68 consecutive patients in stable clinical condition who received regular HD in the FMC Dialysis Center, Pécs were included. VS parameters (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity - PWV, aortic augmentation index - AIx) were determined by applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Sidney) and the routine latoratory test were completed with measurements of osteocalcin (OC), osteopontin (OP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) by using commercially available ELISA kits. 35 heathcare workers served as controls.; Results: In patients on regular HD PWV markedly increased and there was several-fold elevation in the interrelated bone-specific proteins (OC, OP, OPG). PWV was found to be independently associated only with OC (β:-0.25, p<0.029) and age (r=0.411,p<0.000), but risk factors for arterial calcification had significant impact on OC (systolic blood pressure, hsCRP, BMI), OPG (age, BMI) and OP (LDL-cholesterol).; Conclusion: Except for OC, our results failed to document direct association of vascular lesion with OP and OPG, therefore their high circulating levels may be an epiphenomenon or they may have counter-regulatory role to attenuate the uremic calcification process.; © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to deduce the influence of atherosclerosis and plasma D-dimer concentration on the functioning of arteriovenous fistulae for hemodialysis.; Methods: The study was organized as a prospective and non-randomized investigation in the "Kragujevac" Clinical Center. The 81 examined patients, 49 (60.5%) males and 32 (39.5%) females, were divided into a group (n = 36) requiring several attempts to create arteriovenous fistulae for hemodialysis and a group (n = 45) with no complications of arteriovenous fistulae for hemodialysis. The demographic structure, etiology of renal disease, biochemical parameters and concentration of D-dimer were analyzed at the beginning of the study and 1 year later, as well as the existence of tissue calcification and Duplex ultrasound parameters of the carotid artery.; Results: The patients with arteriovenous fistulae complications were significantly older (58.4 +/- 12.9 vs. 52.3 +/- 11.6 years; P = 0.026). High venous pressure (98.6 +/- 29.98 vs. 80 +/- 33.57 mmHg; P = 0.005) and soft-tissue calcification (P = 0.03) were correlated with the occurrence of arteriovenous fistula complications. The greatest risk for failure of fistula was within the first month after creation of the anastomosis (failure rate was 0.235). The hemoglobin concentration (89 +/- 14.0 vs. 96.6 +/- 17.7 g/l; P = 0.048) was lower, and concentration of D-dimer at the end of the study was higher (219.56 +/- 193.05 vs. 332.03 +/- 149.48; P = 0.012) in patients with vascular access complications. By Cox regression analysis, the concentration of fibrin D-dimer at the end of the study was shown to be a significant predictor of fistula survival (beta = 0.002; P = 0.006).; Conclusions: Complications of arteriovenous fistulae were more often recorded in older patients. The greatest risk for fistula functioning was within the first month after creation of the anastomosis. Vein pressure and anemia were important indicators of arteriovenous fistula complications. D-dimer was a significant marker of arteriovenous fistula thrombosis.;

AB  - Background: One of the origins of cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients is arterial stiffness. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between the calcium content of peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution and arterial stiffness.; Patients and Methods: We enrolled into the study 49 PD patients who had been treated with the same PD solution for the preceding 6 months. The calcium content of the PD solution was 1.25 mmol/L in 34 patients (low-Ca group) and 1.75 mmol/L in 15 patients (high-Ca group). Study patients were followed for 6 months on the same PD prescription. Arterial stiffness was assessed by measurement of augmentation index (AI) and brachial pulse wave velocity (PWV) at baseline and at month 6 (SphygmoCor: Atcor Medical, West Ryde, NSW, Australia). Demographic data were recorded from patient charts.; Results: Mean age of the whole group was 51 +/- 11 years, prevalence of diabetes was 14%, duration of PD was 43 +/- 30 months, percentage of women was 45%, and percentage of patients using a cycler was 33%. We observed no differences between groups with regard to those variables or creatinine clearance, residual renal function, Ca, phosphorus, parathormone, C-reactive protein, lipid parameters, and use of phosphate binder with or without Ca content. Mean arterial pressure was higher in the high-Ca group, but the difference was not statistically significant (100 +/- 22 mmHg vs 88 +/- 18 mmHg, p = 0.06). At baseline, AI was significantly higher in the high-Ca group than in the low-Ca group (27% +/- 10% vs 21% +/- 9%, p < 0.05). Measurements of PWV were not different between the groups (8.4 +/- 1.1 m/s vs 8.5 +/- 1.7 m/s). Measurement of arterial stiffness parameters at month 6 revealed that PWV had increased in the high-Ca group (to 9.6 +/- 2.3 m/s from 8.4 +/- 1.1 m/s, p < 0.05), but had not changed in the low-Ca group (to 8.2 +/- 1.9 m/s from 8.5 +/- 1.7 m/s). The AI did not change in either group.; Conclusions: These data suggest that Ca exposure through PD solution plays a role in the progression of arterial stiffness, which may be related to increased vascular calcification.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcifications are frequent in Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD-5) patients receiving haemodialysis. The current study was designed to evaluate the associations between bone turnover/volume and coronary artery calcifications (CAC).; Methods: In 207 CKD-5 patients, bone biopsies, multislice computed tomography of the coronary arteries and blood drawings for relevant biochemical parameters were done. The large number of CKD-5 patients enrolled allowed separate evaluation of patients with CAC versus patients without CAC and adjustment for traditional and non-traditional risk factors for CAC.; Results: When all patients were analysed, associations were found between CAC and bone turnover, bone volume, age, gender and dialysis vintage. When only patients with CAC were included, there was a U-shaped relationship between CAC and bone turnover, whilst the association with bone volume was lost. In these patients, the relationship of CAC with age, gender and dialysis vintage remained.; Conclusions: Beyond the non-modifiable risk factors of age, gender and dialysis vintage, these data show that bone abnormalities of renal osteodystrophy amenable to treatment should be considered in the management of patients with CAC.;

AB  - Background: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with a markedly increased cardiac calcification burden, as reflected by computed tomography scans of the heart. Nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) is a novel form of renal replacement therapy which has multiple physiologic effects that may affect vascular calcification, including improvements in phosphate and uraemia control. The objective of the present study is the determination of the natural history of coronary calcification progression in patients converted to NHD, and the examination of the relationships between calcification risk factors and calcification progression in these patients.; Methods: Thirty-eight ESRD patients were converted to NHD, and included in our observational cohort study. Coronary artery calcification scores (CACS) were documented at baseline and post-conversion (mean interscan duration 16+/-1 months). Other variables of interest included age, dialysis vintage, Framingham risk profile, phosphate binder and vitamin D usage, and plasma levels of calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone.; Results: Our cohort was stratified according to baseline calcification burden (minimal calcification: CACS < or = 10 vs significant calcification: CACS > 10). Twenty-four patients had baseline CACS < or = 10. These patients demonstrated no change in coronary calcification after 1 year of NHD (from 0.7+/-0.5 to 6+/-3, P = 0.1). Fourteen patients had higher initial CACS at baseline (1874+/-696), and demonstrated a non-significant 9% increase over 1 year to 2038+/-740 (P = 0.1). Plasma phosphate and calcium x phosphate product were significantly reduced, as were calcium-based phosphate binder and antihypertensive usage.; Conclusions: Our study is the first to document CACS progression in a cohort of NHD patients. Further analysis of the effect of NHD on the physiology of cardiovascular calcification is required.;

AB  - Background: Peripheral vascular disease and major extremity amputation are common in patients with established renal failure and are associated with considerable morbidity. Several studies have shown high rates of amputation following simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation, but there is minimal literature on the incidence of amputation following renal transplantation. Furthermore, there is little evidence regarding the best method of predicting which patients might be at risk of developing peripheral vascular complications after transplantation.; Methods: We undertook a 5 year follow-up on the cohort of patients who were on our renal transplant waiting list 5 years ago (January 2007). At this time, it was standard practice within our unit for all patients to have routine pelvic x-rays to assess for vascular calcification of the iliac vessels at the time of activation onto the transplant waiting list. Any patients with moderate/severe calcification on x-ray, which may complicate transplantation, were referred for computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of their aorto-iliac vessels. Mortality, transplantation outcomes, and amputation rates at 5 years were correlated with the severity of calcification on preoperative imaging.; Results: One hundred eighty-seven patients were on the waiting list for renal transplantation in January 2007 (92 men; mean age, 58.3 +/- 6.2 years). Ninety-three patients received a transplant during the subsequent 5 years. By January 2012, 82 patients had a functioning transplant, 45 remained on the waiting list (5 suspended), 40 patients had died, and 20 were alive but no longer on the waiting list. Seventy-three (39.5%) had moderate or severe calcification on plain x-ray and went on to have CTA. Of these patients, 16 (21.9%) had extensive calcification affecting all the iliac vessels and were removed from the waiting list as a result. Preoperative imaging was useful in determining the side for surgery in a further 18 patients (24.3%). Twenty-two patients developed vascular complications. Nineteen (86.4%) had moderate-severe vascular calcification on imaging. Four of the patients with vascular complications (18.2%) underwent transplantation (2 had below knee amputation (BKA) prior to transplantation; 1 developed distal ischemia on the same side as the transplantation 2 years postoperatively; 1 had bilateral above knee amputation (AKA) approximately 2 years after transplantation). Eleven (50%) of the patients with vascular complications were dead at 5 years of follow-up. Mortality and amputation rates were higher in patients with moderate-severe calcification than minimal calcification (30.1% vs 16.6%; P = .02 and 10.9% vs 1.8%; P = .003, respectively). There was no difference in rates of delayed graft function (DGF), biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), or creatinine at 1 year between patients who underwent transplantation with moderate-severe calcification and those without, however, intraoperative vascular complications (26.7% vs 3%; P < .001), graft loss (28.1% vs 3.4%; P = .01), and death with a functioning transplant (9.7% vs 1.6%; P = .04) rates were higher in patients with extensive calcification compared with those without.; Conclusions: Plain x-ray of the pelvis is a useful screening tool to identify those patients who may require further detailed vascular imaging prior to transplantation. Amputation rates following renal transplantation are low and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in isolation should not preclude transplantation. Nevertheless, significant vascular calcification is predictive of mortality both with and without transplantation and graft loss in patients with a renal transplant.; Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) is closely related to total atherosclerotic plaque burden. However, the pathogenesis of CAC is still unclear. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, smoking, and chronic inflammation have been suggested to link vascular calcification and bone loss. In the present study, we hypothesized that bone loss can contribute to the pathogenesis of CAC in patients with the chronic inflammatory condition that accompanies metabolic syndrome (MetS). The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between CAC and bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with MetS and in patients without MetS, by using coronary multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT).; Subjects and Methods: Data from 395 consecutive patients was analyzed retrospectively. From the MDCT database, only those patients who underwent both coronary MDCT and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry within an interval of one month, were selected. The presence of MetS was determined by the updated criteria as defined by the Third Adult Treatment Panel Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program.; Results: In patients with MetS, a significant correlation was found between CAC and age {odds ratio (OR)=1.139, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.080 to 1.201, p<0.001}, CAC and male sex (OR=3.762, 95% CI 1.339 to 10.569, p=0.012), and CAC and T-score of L-spine (OR=0.740, 95% CI 0.550 to 0.996, p=0.047) using a forward multiple logistic regression analysis model including clinical variables of gender, age, lipid profile, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, and BMD. But in patients without MetS, BMD by itself was not found to contribute to CAC.; Conclusion: BMD was inversely correlated with CAC only in patients with MetS. This finding suggests that low BMD accompanied by MetS, may have significant clinical implications.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification is associated with structural and functional abnormality of the heart and blood vessels. We investigated the relationship between intradialytic hypotension (IDH) and vascular calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients, and their impacts on cardiovascular events (CVEs).; Method: We enrolled 191 maintenance HD patients who underwent plain abdomen radiography for abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS). A nadir systolic blood pressure (BP) < 90 mm Hg or the requirement of bolus fluid administration was required to quantify the hypotension diagnosis. IDH was defined as > 2 hypotension episodes during 10 HD treatments.; Results: Among the 191 patients, IDH occurred in 32. AACS was higher in the IDH group compared with the no-IDH group (8.4 ± 6.0 vs. 4.9 ± 5.2, respectively; P = 0.001). High AACS was an independent risk factor after adjustment for age, diabetes mellitus, ultrafiltration, diastolic BP, and calcium level (odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.01-1.18; P = 0.03). Patients with both IDH and AACS ≧ 4 had the highest cumulative CVE rate (27.9%, P = 0.008) compared with 11.2%, 12.5%, and 6% for those with AACS ≧ 4 only, with IDH only, and neither, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the presence of both IDH and AACS ≧ 4 was a significant predictor of CVE (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.04-7.74, P = 0.04).; Conclusion: IDH is associated with abdominal aortic calcification and is an independent risk factor for IDH. Both IDH and high AACS were significant predictors of CVE.;

AB  - Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcification in the medium and small vessel arterioles and can be a life-threatening complication often associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A review of the literature was conducted to explore existing evidence about the relationship between obesity and calciphylaxis. A total of 54 publications (published between 1962 and 2015) were identified. Most studies noted a variety of risk factors for calciphylaxis, including CKD, female gender, Caucasian race, liver disease, and lower serum albumin. Obesity was identified as a risk factor in 6 of the 8 studies reviewed. In one study, obesity was found to increase the risk of calciphylaxis 4-fold. The majority of calciphylaxis lesions in obese persons were proximal in distribution; all studies report proximal lesions are associated with a higher mortality rate than distal lesions. The mortality rate of persons with CKD and calciphylaxis is 8 times higher than that of persons with CKD without calciphylaxis. There is no definitive evidence to support the belief current epidemic rates of obesity, diabetes, (diabesity), and chronic renal disease will predispose more patients to the development of calciphylaxis. However, until more information from the calciphylaxis registries and other studies is available, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion when a patient presents with indurated, painful nodules or necrotic ulcers, especially if the patient also has CKD.;

AB  - Background: Although aortic calcification has a significant negative impact on prognosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD), risk factors for aortic calcification progression remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between malnutrition and aortic calcification progression in patients on HD.; Methods: Between April 2015 and October 2016, we treated 232 patients on HD. Of those, we retrospectively evaluated data from 184 patients who had had regular blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scans. The abdominal aortic calcification index (ACI) was quantitatively measured by abdominal CT. Nutritional status was evaluated using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). A normalized treatment ratio of functional urea clearance was evaluated by Kt/V. The difference in ACI values between 2015 and 2016 was evaluated as a ΔACI, and patients were stratified into two groups according to ΔACI value: high (≥75th percentile, ΔACI-high group) and low (<75th percentile, ΔACI-low group). Variables such as age, sex, comorbidities, dialysis vintage, serum data, and GNRI were compared between ΔACI-high and ΔACI-low patients. Factors independently associated with a higher ΔACI progression (ΔACI ≥75th percentile) were determined using multivariate logistic analysis.; Results: Median values of ACIs in 2015 and 2016 were 40.8 and 44.6%, respectively. Of 184 patients, 125 (68%) patients experienced ACI progression for 1 year. The median ΔACI and 75th percentile of ΔACI were 2.5% and 5.8%, respectively. The number of patients in the ΔACI-low and ΔACI-high groups were 128 (70%) and 56 (30%), respectively. There were significant differences in sex, presence of diabetic nephropathy, HD vintage, serum albumin, serum phosphate, C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, Kt/V, and GNRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that independent factors associated with a higher ΔACI progression were male sex, serum phosphate levels, HD vintage, and GNRI of < 90.; Conclusions: Our results suggest that poor nutritional status is an independent risk factor for the progression of aortic calcification. Nutrition management may have the potential to improve progression of aortic calcification in patients on HD.; Trial Registration: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000028050 .;

AB  - Background: Observational data suggest that serum magnesium (Mg) concentration is inversely related to vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In recent years, there have been several case reports of hypomagnesemia due to use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), with the hypomagnesemia attributed to inappropriate gastrointestinal (GI) Mg loss. We hypothesized that the tendency to GI Mg loss is more common than is currently reported. Since patients with ESRD have little to no renal Mg loss to affect serum Mg concentration, dialysis patients are an interesting population in whom to study the relationship between PPI use and serum Mg levels.; Methods: Using a single-center cross-sectional design, we studied 155 prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum Mg concentration for each patient was determined based on the mean of 3 consecutive serum Mg levels drawn at 6 week intervals. PPI use at the time of the blood tests was documented. The relationship between PPI use and Mg concentration was determined in unadjusted analyses, as well as after adjustment for age, gender, race, cause of ESRD, diabetes, time on HD and dialysate Mg concentration.; Results: 55 % of patients were on PPIs at the time of the study. The majority of patients (62 %) used a dialysate Mg (in mmol/L) of 0.5, and the remainder (38 %) used a dialysate Mg of 0.375. Serum Mg levels were significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users (0.93 vs. 1.02 mmol/L, p < 0.001). This finding persisted after stratifying for dialysate Mg concentration, and after multivariable adjustment (p < 0.001). In addition, more PPI users vs. non-users had a Mg level < 1 mmol/L (79 % vs. 43 %) and a Mg level < 0.8 mmol/L (16 % vs. 4 %). There was a non-significant trend toward increased time on PPI being associated with lower serum Mg levels (p = 0.067).; Conclusion: Among HD patients, PPI users have lower serum Mg levels as compared with non-users. Further research is required to determine whether the magnitude of change in Mg levels among PPI users is associated with adverse outcomes.;

AB  - Aim: Fetuin-A is a member of protease inhibitors that act as an inhibitor of vascular calcification. In our study, the relationship of fetuin-A with metabolic and echocardiographic parameters in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients has been investigated.; Methods: Besides demographic, clinical and laboratory data, fetuin-A level was recorded. Echocardiographic examinations were performed by the same operator.; Results: Fifty-two chronic PD patients (mean age: 52.7 ± 15.4 years) and 31 healthy volunteers (mean age: 41.3 ± 10.7 years) were included. Fetuin-A levels were significantly lower in the patient group (57.5 ± 31.5 ng/mL vs. 72.5 ± 34.0 ng/mL, P = 0.002). There was a significant relation between age and fetuin-A levels (P = 0.025). Four patients with chronic heart failure had significantly lower fetuin-A levels compared with those without. There was no relation between fetuin-A levels and the presence of diabetes mellitus, left ventricular hypertrophy and ischemic heart disease. No relationship was detected between fetuin-A level and any echocardiographic parameter. Age and hematocrite were correlated negatively, and serum albumin positively with fetuin-A levels. On linear regression analysis, fetuin-A level was related with age, hematocrite and presence of heart failure.; Conclusion: PD patients with heart failure have significantly lower fetuin-A levels. Age is a main determinant of fetuin-A level and fetuin-A may act as a negative acute phase reactant in PD patients.;

AB  - Background: Calcification of the arteries of the lower extremities is a very common pathological process, which has an independent significance in the development of cardiovascular diseases. There is evidence that development of calcification of the arteries correlates with a mutation of the MGP protein gene representing by the Thr83Ala polymorphism.; Aim: The purpose of the study was to analyse the connection of Thr83Ala polymorphism of the MGP gene with the development of calcification of the arteries of the lower extremities.; Methods: The study involved 80 patients. Half of them had signs of calcification of the arteries of the lower extremities. The allelic Thr83Ala polymorphism of the MGP protein gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction, establishing the presence of calcification of the arteries by radiological and dopplerographic methods.; Results: The study aimed to analyse the association of the Thr83Ala polymorphism of the matrix Gla protein gene with the development of calcification of the arteries of the lower extremities. The data obtained suggest that the replacement of threonine by alanine in the 83rd position of the MGP molecule can affect the functional properties of the protein and in particular its anticarcinogenic properties. Although there was no difference in the distribution of different variants of the genotype by Thr83Ala to the MGP gene polymorphism in patients with CA and healthy patients, but in the distribution of genotypes in the comparison groups separated by sex, it was found that in women, carriage of the Ala allele in a homozygous state is a factor, which protects the development of arterial calcination in the elderly and senile.; Conclusion: Differences in the distribution of different variants of the genotype according to Thr83Ala to the polymorphism of the MGP gene between patients with CAD and healthy patients do not exceed the limits of statistical significance. In the distribution of genotypes in the comparison groups divided by sex, it was found that in women the carrier of the Ala-allele in the homozygous state is a factor that prevents the development of Menkeberg arteriosclerosis in the elderly and old age.;

AB  - Background: The change of aortic stiffness, but not the particular baseline value, plays a crucial role in estimating the patient risk with end-stage renal disease. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the evolution of central and peripheral arterial stiffness in hemodialysis population without previous cardiovascular events during a 2-year follow-up.; Methods: 60 hemodialysis patients (mean age 57.61 ± 13.01 years) were prospectively interviewed, and they underwent blood tests, chest X-ray for aortic calcification evaluation and pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements at the baseline, after 6 months and after 2 years of observation period.; Results: We found significant progression of aortic PWV (12.73 vs. 14.24 m/s, p = 0.032) and regression of brachial PWV (11.53 vs. 8.85 m/s, p < 0.001). CRP increase influenced evolution of aortic PWV (β = 0.331, p = 0.031, R2 = 0.599). Higher β2-microglobulin values was related to the progression of aortic PWV (β = 0.219, p = 0.022, R2 = 0.568). Mean arterial blood pressure had influence only on the short-term arterial stiffness evolution.; Conclusions: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis experience pronounced changes of arterial stiffness during the 2-year follow-up period. The progression of aortic stiffness is related to inflammatory response and particularly is influenced by β2-microglobulin concentration and aortic calcification.;

AB  - Objective: This study evaluated the correlation between an upper limb vascular calcification (Vc) score (VcS) and late all-cause mortality in diabetic hemodialysis patients with distal upper limb arteries medial wall sclerosis (Mönckeberg disease).; Methods: We retrospectively reviewed Vc in bilateral upper limb plain radiographs and in duplex ultrasound images performed before radial-cephalic fistula (RCF) creation in diabetic hemodialysis patients. Only medial linear calcifications outlining the vessel wall were considered positive on X-ray images, whereas for ultrasound reviews, only continuous highly echogenic plaques producing bright white echos with shadowing were considered to be medial calcification. A VcS was then applied in each patient. Every half of each of the three main arterial conduits (brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries) in each arm was counted as 1 if it contained ≥ 6 cm of linear calcification, whereas absence of calcification or minimum calcification (length <6 cm) was counted as 0. Long-term all-cause mortality was compared between patients with a low or moderate VcS <8 (group I), patients with a high VcS ≥ 8 (group II), and patients with VcS = 0 (control group). Kaplan-Meier statistics were used for comparisons among the groups.; Results: Nineteen patients had a VcS <8, 21 had VcS ≥ 8, and 43 patients had VcS = 0. The study patients had a mean age of 68 ± 10 years (range, 42-83 years; P = .23). Before early conversion to a RCF, dialysis therapy in 59 (71.1%) had already been initiated through central venous catheters (CVCs). The mean follow-up for groups I, II, and controls was 41.4 ± 41.2 months (range, 4-144 months), 34.15 ± 31.3 months (range, 1-108 months), and 66.7 ± 32.5 months (range, 12-126 months), respectively (P = .0009). Forty-seven patients died during the follow-up period (12 in group II and 24 in the controls; P = .88). Survival rates at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months were 78.3%, 65.7%, 54.8%, and 48.1% for group I; 75.2%, 58.8%, 49.3%, and 42% for group II; and 97.7%, 93.1%, 76.8%, and 71.8% for the control group, respectively (P = .013 for all groups; P = .044 for group II vs controls). Patients with (subgroups) or without CVCs at baseline had similar late mortality rates. Patients with CVCs/Vc had lower survival rates than those with CVCs/no Vc at 1 year (73.3% vs 96.5%) and at 3 years (47.7% vs 75.8%; P = .038). CVCs were related to increased risk of death only in subgroup II patients compared with the subcontrol group patients (75.4% vs 37.9% at 5 years, respectively; P = .034).; Conclusions: Diabetic hemodialysis patients exposed to high levels of upper extremity arterial medial VcSs upon receiving RCFs have an increased long-term mortality risk compared with diabetic hemodialysis patients with no Vc and receiving the same access. Patients with CVCs/Vc had the lowest survival rates.; Copyright © 2015 Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - At present, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) can be measured easily and noninvasively. We studied the correlation between aortic damage estimated by baPWV and that determined by measuring the length of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) on X-ray films, which parameter has been significantly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. baPWV was measured using the form PWV/ankle brachial index (ABI) device in 97 patients free of end-stage renal failure or peripheral arterial disease. baPWV correlated significantly with age (r2=0.625, p<0.0001), was significantly higher in hypertensives than in normotensives (2,109+/-67 vs. 1,623+/-93 cm/s, p<0.0001), and correlated significantly with systolic blood pressure (r2=0.64, p<0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (r2=0.397, p<0.0001). baPWV was significantly higher in diabetic patients than in nondiabetics (2,068+/-73 vs. 1,813+/-97 cm/s, p<0.05), but was similar in normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic patients. baPWV did not correlate with body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol or triglyceride levels, but correlated significantly with AAC length (r2=0.599, p<0.0001). Multiple regression analysis indicated that age, systolic blood pressure and AAC length were independent determinants of baPWV. Our results indicate that baPWV is useful for estimating aortic damage and could be a potentially useful predictor of vascular morbidity and mortality.;

AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is linked to post-transplant cardiovascular events and hypercalcemia which may influence kidney graft function in the long term. We aimed to evaluate whether pretransplant aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can predict post-transplant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and to assess its association with post-transplant plasma calcium levels and renal function in one-year follow-up. Our single-center observational prospective study enrolled 37 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without previous history of vascular events. Two radiologists evaluated pretransplant AoAC on chest X-ray as suggested by Ogawa et al. in 2009. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.71. The mismatching results were repeatedly reviewed and resulted in consensus. Carotid-femoral (cfPWV) and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (crPWV) was measured using applanation tonometry before and one year after transplantation. Patient clinical, biochemical data, and cardiovascular/CVE rate were monitored within 1 year. We found out that eGFR1year correlated with eGFRdischarge and calcium based on hospital discharge data (β = 0.563, p = .004 and β = 51.360, p = .026, respectively). Multivariate linear regression revealed that donor age, donor gender, and recipient eGFRdischarge (R-squared 0.65, p = .002) better predict eGFR1year than AoAC combined with recipient eGFRdischarge (R-squared 0.35, p = .006). During 1-year follow-up, four (10.81%) patients experienced cardiovascular events, which were predicted by PWV ratio (HR 7.549, p = .045), but not related to AoAC score (HR 1.044, p = .158). In conclusion, KTR without previous vascular events have quite low cardiovascular/CVE rate within 1-year follow-up. VC evaluated as AoAC on pretransplant chest X-ray together with recipient eGFRdischarge could be related to kidney function in one-year follow-up.;

AB  - Background: Drug-eluting stents (DES) have significantly reduced in-stent restenosis. But the calcification of coronary artery lesions in hemodialysis patients is a high-risk factor for restenosis after DES implantation. We hypothesized that percutaneous transluminal coronary rotational atherectomy (PTCRA) may be useful in the prevention of underexpansion and fracture of the stents, thereby reducing major adverse cardiac events.; Methods: We retrospectively compared the primary success and mid-term outcomes (major adverse cardiac events within 12 months) of hemodialysis patients with calcified coronary lesions undergoing DES implantation using PTCRA (n=26) with those where DES was implanted without PTCRA (n=28).; Results: The rates of target lesion revascularization in the PTCRA group were lower than those in the non-PTCRA group (11.5% vs 35.7%, p=0.026). The rates of restenosis and subacute thrombosis in the PTCRA group were modestly lower than those in the non-PTCRA group (restenosis rate, 17.4% vs 17.4%, p=0.061; subacute thrombosis rate, 0% vs 7.1%, p=0.31).; Conclusion: PTCRA may be useful for improving the mid-term outcome of DES implantation in hemodialysis patients with calcified lesions.; Copyright 2009.

AB  - Background and Aim Of the Study: The study aim was to determine the correlates of valvular calcification (VC), including clinical and physiologic parameters, in individuals new to dialysis. In addition, the association of VC with coronary artery calcification (CAC) progression and mortality was investigated.; Methods: A total of 101 incident dialysis individuals underwent electrocardiogram-triggered multislice computed tomography (CT) to monitor the presence and quantification of calcification. The average follow up was 2.85 +/- 0.72 years.; Results: Twenty-six (25.7%) patients had only one valve calcified, while 10 (9.9%) had calcifications in both valves. Patients with VC were older, more likely to have a history of diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD), more likely to have CAC, and to be Caucasian; fibrinogen and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were also higher in these patients. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis revealed older age, history of CVD, increasing fibrinogen, and presence of CAC were independently associated with the presence of VC. Patients with VC also had a higher median annualized CAC progression compared to those without VC (2.90 versus 105.2, p = 0.004). The mortality rate per 100 years was 2.57 in patients without VC, compared to 4.20 and 13.76, respectively, for those with one or two calcified valves. An increasing number of calcified valves was associated with a higher mortality after adjustment for gender and race [HR 2.2 (1.03-4.69), p = 0.04], but was not statistically significant after adjustment for inflammatory markers such as IL-6 or fibrinogen.; Conclusion: Traditional and novel risk factors are associated with the presence of VC, which is a risk marker for CAC progression and mortality in incident dialysis patients.;

AB  - Vascular calcification is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for vascular access calcification and to determine if patients with this disorder are at increased risk of death. Vascular access calcification was found in 49 of 212 hemodialysis patients as measured by plain X-ray (arteriovenous fistula or synthetic graft) in two dimensions. Male gender, diabetes mellitus, and length of time on dialysis were independent predictors for access calcification determined by logistic regression multivariate analysis. Serum parameters were not independently related to access calcification. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increased mortality risk, and Cox regression analysis confirmed that vascular access calcification was an independent mortality predictor. Our study suggests that detection of vascular access calcification is a cost-effective method to identify patients at increased mortality risk.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification is common and may affect cardiac function in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, little is known about the effect of residual renal function on vascular calcification and cardiac function in patients on hemodialysis.; Methods: This study was conducted between January 2014 and January 2017. One hundred six patients with residual renal function on maintenance hemodialysis for 3 months were recruited. We used residual renal urea clearance (KRU) to measure residual renal function. First, abdominal aortic calcification score (AACS) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were measured in patients on hemodialysis. Second, we performed echocardiography and investigated new cardiovascular events after study enrollment.; Results: The median KRU was 0.9 (0.3-2.5) mL/min/1.73m2. AACS (4.0 [1.0-10.0] vs. 3.0 [0.0-8.0], p = 0.05) and baPWV (1836.1 ± 250.4 vs. 1676.8 ± 311.0 cm/s, p = 0.01) were significantly higher in patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 than a KRU ≥ 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2. Log-KRU significantly negatively correlated with log-AACS (ß = -0.29, p = 0.002) and baPWV (ß = -0.19, P = 0.05) after factor adjustment. The proportion of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was significantly higher in patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 than with a KRU ≥ 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 (67.9% vs. 49.1%, p = 0.05). Patients with a KRU < 0.9 mL/min/1.73m2 showed a higher tendency of cumulative cardiovascular events compared to those with a KRU ≥ 0.9 ml/min/1.73m2 (P = 0.08).; Conclusions: Residual renal function was significantly associated with vascular calcification and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients on hemodialysis.;

AB  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) and intradialytic hypotension (IDH) indicate morphological and functional disorders of the cardiovascular system in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, their relationship and combined effects on clinical outcomes remain undetermined.; Methods: HD patients (n=443) whose plain chest radiographs were examined for aortic arch VC were included. IDH was defined as nadir systolic blood pressure <90mmHg or need for bolus fluid. We investigated the relationship between VC and IDH, and their clinical significance for cardiovascular events (CVEs) and death.; Results: VC was found in 57 HD patients (12.9%). IDH was more prevalent in patients with VC compared with those without VC (35.1% vs. 18.7%; P=0.004). VC was independently associated with a 2.12-fold increase in the risk of IDH (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-4.36). In multivariate analysis, compared with patients with neither VC nor IDH, the coexistence of VC and IDH was independently associated with death (hazard ratio [HR], 3.83; 95% CI, 1.62-9.08) and CVE (HR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.53-9.33), whereas VC or IDH alone was not. Patients with both VC and IDH had the highest risk for a composite event (HR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.79-7.08). Significant synergistic interaction was observed between VC and IDH (P for interaction=0.009).; Conclusions: VC was independently associated with IDH. Coexistence of VC and IDH was associated with higher risk of death and CVEs than either factor alone. There was a synergistic interaction between VC and IDH for the risk of a composite event.; Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: We examined the relationship and combined effect of vascular calcification (VC) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on deaths and cardiovascular events (CVEs) in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: Maintenance HD patients (n=341) were included. Echocardiography data and plain chest radiographs were used to assess LVH and aortic arch VC. Results: VC was found in 100 patients (29.3%). LVH was more prevalent in patients with VC compared with those without VC (70% vs. 50.2%, P=0.001). VC was independently associated with a 2.42-fold increased risk of LVH (95% CI, 1.26-4.65). In multivariate analysis, compared with patients with neither VC nor LVH, the coexistence of VC and LVH was independently associated with CVE (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.09-3.72), whereas VC or LVH alone was not. Patients with both VC and LVH had the highest risk for a composite event of deaths or CVE (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.15-3.06). Significant synergistic interaction was observed between VC and LVH (P for interaction=0.039). Conclusions: VC was independently associated with LVH. The coexistence of VC and LVH was associated with higher risk of deaths and CVEs than either factor alone. VC and LVH showed a synergistic interaction for the risk of deaths and CVEs.;

AB  - Unlabelled: The risk factors for vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients include duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, aging, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and calcium or vitamin D supplementation. This study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for VC in our dialysis population.; Methods: One hundred twenty-nine chronic dialysis patients underwent plain x-rays of the hands for VC. Patients were grouped as either positive (PVC) or negative (NVC) for VC. Age, gender, duration of dialysis, presence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), oral calcium, and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 supplement, serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), calcium phosphorus product (CaxP), alkaline phosphates (ALP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were compared between the two groups.; Results: Thirty-four patients (26.35%) showed VC. There were no differences between PVC and NVC patients for duration of dialysis (38.4 +/- 27.7 for PVC and 34.6 +/- 31.2 months for NVC, P = .80), levels of serum Ca (P = .26), P (P = .19), CaxP (P = .33), ALP (P = .89), or iPTH (P = .24). Similarly, oral calcium and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 intake were not different between the two groups (P = .971 and P = .3710 respectively). Compared to NVC patients, PVC patients were older (56.3 +/- 10.4 versus 47.5 +/- 16.1 years, P = .008) and had a greater incidence of NIDDM (17/34 PVC and diabetic versus 20/95 NVC, P = .001). In conclusion, for patients with a medium length of dialysis, the duration of dialysis as well as the doses of calcium salts and of 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 were not significantly associated with vascular calcifications, but it was not possible to exclude a role for these and other factors in patients with longer dialysis.;

AB  - Aim: Vascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and CKD-related risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and phosphate retention. Kidney transplantation improves kidney function and abnormal mineral metabolism at the same time. It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation favourably impacts VC in the long-term.; Methods: The present study examined VC in 132 kidney transplant (KT) recipients who had been transplanted for longer than one year. The severity of VC was compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney transplant (KT) waiting list.; Results: The median KT vintage was 88 months. The prevalence of VC among KT and CKD patients were 54.5% and 62.8%, respectively, (P = 0.2). There were no differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the prevalence of DM or CVD between the two groups. Among patients with calcification, a more severe degree was observed in KT recipients (P = 0.01). Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage were associated with significant VC in both groups. The degree of VC in KT recipients was more pronounced than that in CKD patients among those who experienced prolonged dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P = 0.04). Among KT recipients, the severity of VC increased with the length of time after transplantation and became more substantial after 5 years.; Conclusions: Long-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe degree of VC compared to matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC became more pronounced among those with longer transplant vintage and was in part influenced by past dialysis experience.; © 2014 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.

AB  - Aim: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, and an inverse relationship of VC to bone mineral density (BMD) has been reported. Because elderly patients are prone to atherosclerosis and BMD artefact, we examined the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in younger patients undergoing transplantation, and its relationship to BMD.; Methods: Laboratory testing was performed immediately before kidney or simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. Within 4 weeks patients underwent BMD evaluation and lateral abdominal X-ray. Aortic calcification was scored using a validated 24-point scale.; Results: Of 650 consecutive patients X-rays were available for 531 (82%). Their median age was 41 years (16-71), 58% were male, dialysis vintage was 20 months (0-402) and 69% had kidney and 31% SPK transplants. VC scores were ≥1 in 47%, with the median score 6 (1-24) and was associated with age, dialysis vintage and presence of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. In a multivariate analysis of patients with and without VC, those with VC were older and of longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.07 and 1.17 per 12 months respectively; P < 0.001 for both). In that analysis, VC was not significantly associated with gender, transplant type, presence of diabetes, current or former smoking or calcium or calcitriol therapy, and was not inversely related to hip, spine or forearm BMD Z-scores.; Conclusion: VC is common in younger patients undergoing transplantation and, similar to older patients, is associated with age, dialysis vintage and cardiovascular pathology. However, in this younger patient group, there was no significant inverse association of VC to BMD.; © 2014 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.

AB  - Background: Several factors suggest that the presence of vascular calcification (VC) is associated with a high risk of cardiac events in uremic patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of VC on cardiac morbidity and mortality in our hemodialysis (HD) patients.; Methods: We studied 79 patients on HD: 43 males, mean age 48 +/- 15 years old, mean time on HD 83 +/- 63 months. The presence of VC was evaluated by radiologic series. Other cardiovascular risk factors analyzed were arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cigarette smoking, anemia, and dyslipidemia. All patients underwent M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography. Patients were followed for two years. During this time, clinical information collected included predialysis blood pressure, incidence of ischemic heart disease, episodes of congestive heart failure, and mortality due to cardiovascular event.; Results: VC was observed in 55.7% of patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and cardiac valve calcification were significantly associated with VC. Ischemic heart disease (71.4% vs. 28.6%) and episodes of cardiac failure (0.41 vs. 0.18 per year; P < 0.05) appeared more frequently in the patient group with VC. VC was present in 80.6% of patients who developed episodes of heart failure. Eight patients died from cardiac disease; each of them had VC.; Conclusion: The presence of VC can help to identify those HD patients with a higher cardiovascular risk.;

AB  - Introduction: Central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) strongly predicts cardiovascular outcomes. We undertook to measure ambulatory CASP in 74 prevalent dialysis patients using the BPro (HealthStats, Singapore) device. We also determined whether coronary or abdominal aortic calcification was associated with changes in CASP and whether interdialytic CASP predicted ambulatory measurement.; Methods: All patients underwent computed tomography for coronary calcium score, lateral abdominal radiography for aortic calcium score, echocardiography for left ventricular mass index and ambulatory blood pressure measurement using BPro calibrated to brachial blood pressure. HealthStats was able to convert standard BPro SOFT(®) data into ambulatory CASP.; Results: Ambulatory CASP was not different in those without and with coronary (137.6 vs 141.8 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.6) or aortic (136.6 vs 145.6 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.2) calcification. Furthermore, when expressed as a percentage of brachial systolic blood pressure to control for peripheral blood pressure, any difference in CASP was abolished: CASP: brachial systolic blood pressure ratio = 0.9 across all categories regardless of the presence of coronary or aortic calcification (p = 0.2 and 0.4, respectively). Supporting this finding, left ventricular mass index was also not different in those with or without vascular calcification (p = 0.7 and 0.8 for coronary and aortic calcification). Inter-dialytic office blood pressure and CASP correlated excellently with ambulatory measurements (r = 0.9 for both).; Conclusion: Vascular calcification was not associated with changes in ambulatory central aortic systolic pressure in this cohort of prevalent dialysis patients. Inter-dialytic blood pressure and CASP correlated very well with ambulatory measurement.;

AB  - Aim: to look for differences in clinical characteristics, and differences in the role of mineral metabolism disorders and inflammation in diabetic and non diabetic patients.; Methods: subjects were 127 patients on maintenance haemodialysis: 46 with DM and 81 without. Vascular calcification of the aortic arch and peripheral artery were recorded qualitatively using x-ray of the chest and lower extremities. Clinical characteristics and laboratory values were taken from the medical records.; Results: the overall prevalence of vascular calcification was similar in our haemodialysis patients, with or without DM (26.1% vs 25.9%). The diabetic patients were in general of older age (58.5+10.3 vs 51.6+12.6 years, p<0.05), had lower diastolic BP (80+14 vs 86+14 mmHg, p<0.05), and higher prevalence of isolated peripheral artery calcification (13% vs 2.5%, p<0.05). Vascular calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients occurred at the same rate in spite of a lower serum P, (5.7+1.5 vs 6.9+1.5 mg/dl, p<0.05), and Ca X P product (52.3+14.5 vs 60.7+14.5, p<0.05), and shorter HD vintage (1.3+0.9 vs 3.2+3.3 years, p<0.05). In a sub analysis comparing patients according to presence and location of vascular calcification, patients with vascular calcification of the peripheral artery only were mostly diabetics (75%), had lower serum Ca (8.6+0.5mg/dl), P (6.7+0.6mg/dl), Ca x P product (57.4+5.10 mg2/dl2), and higher serum CRP (1.70+1.59mg/dl).; Conclusion: diabetic patients on HD may be at higher risk for peripheral artery calcification, at lower serum Ca, P, and Ca X P product. The higher CRP may indicate a higher inflammatory status, which is probably the major risk factor for vascular calcification of the peripheral artery.;

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a primary cause of mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients. However, it is difficult to select the proper point for coronary angiographic procedure, because dialysis patients frequently do not display typical symptoms. Vascular calcification (VC) scores of artery or aorta on plain radiographs are associated with CAD events and may be predictive of CAD in dialysis patients. Therefore, we evaluated whether high or meaningful VC scores on plain radiographs are related with the severity of lesions detected by coronary angiography (CAG) in dialysis patients. We retrospectively enrolled dialysis patients who underwent CAG and checked several plain radiographs within one year before or after CAG. Significant VC is defined as high or meaningful VC scores, such as long abdominal aortic calcification and medial artery calcification on feet. Of all 55 patients, 41 patients (74.5%) exhibited significant VC on plain radiographs and 23 patients (41.8%) underwent stent insertion. Among the 23 patients, longer stents were used in 18 patients with significant VC (34.1 ± 19.5 mm vs. 16.6 ± 15.2 mm, P = 0.029). Patients with significant VC showed higher prevalence rate of severe coronary artery calcification (P = 0.007) and diffuse/tubular stenosis (P = 0.012), detected by CAG, than those without significant VC. Thus, high or meaningful VC scores on plain radiographs were associated with the degree of calcification or stenosis detected by CAG. In conclusion, VC scores on plain radiographs may be predictive of calcification or stenosis of coronary artery before CAG in dialysis patients.;

AB  - Introduction: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and renal osteodystrophy (ROD) are frequently seen together and represent the major causes of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Some studies suggest a pathogenic link between them, but there is no consensus as yet regarding this issue. The main objective of our study was to establish whether there is any relation between VCs and ROD in our HD patients. We evaluated the prevalence of VCs and ROD and the relationship between VCs and some clinical and biochemical characteristics of HD patients.; Methods: We examined radiological signs of VCs and ROD on hands and pelvis bone radiographs in 81 chronic HD patients, and we calculated a VC score on this basis.; Results: We found a significant relation between radiological signs of ROD and those of VC (P = 0.019). The patients with ROD had a higher mean VC score (P = 0.02). By linear regression, the VC score correlated directly with serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and CaxP product and inversely with serum albumin. The logistic regression model revealed that ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium salts were predictive of VCs development. There were no associations between VCs and age, HD vintage, diabetes, dialysate Ca concentration, vitamin D treatment, spKt/V, URR and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.; Conclusion: There seems to be a pathogenetic link between bone and artery diseases in chronic HD patients. Both VCs and ROD have a high prevalence. ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium salts are risk factors for VCs.;

AB  - Objective: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with vascular calcification. Here we investigated associations between vertebral bone density (VBD) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), quantified by cardiac computed tomography (CT), and BMD quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and their relations with mortality.; Methods: In 231 ESRD patients (median age 56years, 63% males) comprising incident dialysis patients, prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients and recipients of living donor kidney transplant, VBD (Hounsfield units, HUs) and CAC scores (Agatston units, AUs) were quantified by cardiac CT, and, in 143 of the patients, BMD was measured by DXA of total body. Metabolic and inflammation biomarkers potentially linked to CKD-MBD were also analysed.; Results: Patients with low tertile of VBD were older and had more often cardiovascular disease (CVD), and higher HbA1c (non-diabetics), interleukin-6 and CAC score. Low VBD was independently associated with higher CAC score (>100 AUs) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and cohorts. In Cox proportional hazards analysis, low VBD was independently associated with all-cause mortality after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and subjective global assessment (SGA). The root mean-squared error of prediction (RMSE) showed a good degree of association between VBD and BMD evaluated from DXA. In receiver-operator characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, lower VBD was more strongly associated with higher CAC score and all-cause mortality than BMD evaluated from DXA.; Conclusions: While assessments of BMD by DXA and CT showed good degree of agreement, associations of high CAC, and mortality, with low VBD were stronger than those based on low BMD by DXA. The strong independent associations of low VBD with high CAC score and increased mortality risk suggest that VBD may serve as an important prognosticator in ESRD patients.; Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cardiovascular calcification is currently viewed as an active disease process similar to embryonic bone formation. Cardiovascular calcification mainly affects the aortic valve and arteries and is associated with increased mortality risk. Aortic valve and arterial calcification share similar risk factors, including age, gender, diabetes, chronic renal disease, and smoking. However, the exact cellular and molecular mechanism of cardiovascular calcification is unknown. Late-stage cardiovascular calcification can be visualized with conventional imaging modalities such as echocardiography and computed tomography. However, these modalities are limited in their ability to detect the development of early calcification and the progression of calcification until advanced tissue mineralization is apparent. Due to the subsequent late diagnosis of cardiovascular calcification, treatment is usually comprised of invasive interventions such as surgery. The need to understand the process of calcification is therefore warranted and requires new imaging modalities which are able to visualize early cardiovascular calcification. This review focuses on the use of new imaging techniques to visualize novel concepts of cardiovascular calcification.; Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vitamin D might have beneficial effects on vascular health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25D] <or= 15 ng/ml) and insufficiency (25D levels between 16 and 30 ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at different CKD stages and the relationships between vitamin D serum levels, vascular calcification and stiffness, and the mortality risk.; Design, Setting, Participants& Measurements: One hundred forty CKD patients (85 men, mean age 67 +/- 12 yr; CKD stages 2 [8%], 3 [26%], 4 [26%], 5 [7%], and 5D [(33%]) were allocated for a prospective study. Serum levels of 25D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, aortic calcification score, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were evaluated.; Results: There was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42%) and insufficiency (34%). Patients with 25D <or= 16.7 ng/ml (median) had a significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D >16.7 ng/ml (mean follow-up, 605 +/- 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05). Multivariate adjustments (included age, gender, diabetes, arterial pressure, CKD stage, phosphate, albumin, hemoglobin, aortic calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality.; Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were highly prevalent in this CKD cohort. Low 25D levels affected mortality independently of vascular calcification and stiffness, suggesting that 25D may influence survival in CKD patients via additional pathways that need to be further explored.;

AB  - Background: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the general elderly population, and is related to an increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and cardiovascular calcification. Only limited data and no guidelines are available on vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients.; Objective: We aimed to assess the frequency of, and factors associated with, 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients in a French dialysis center.; Design: In March 2006, we studied all prevalent hemodialysis patients who had not received native vitamin D supplements in the recent past. According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative guidelines, patients were assigned to the following 3 groups: group 1, with a sufficient vitamin D serum level (>75 nmol/L); group 2, with an insufficient level (25 to 75 nmol/L); and group 3, with severe deficiency (<25 nmol/L). Patients' characteristics and biochemical findings were compared between patients of groups 1 and 3.; Results: Of 253 patients, 11% patients were in group 1; 47% were in group 2; and 42% were in group 3. The proportions of female and diabetes patients were 42% and 34%, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) age of all patients was 66.7 +/- 14 years, and the mean duration of dialysis was 62 +/- 74 months, with a mean schedule of 3 x 6.5 hours and administration of a 1.5 mmol/L calcium dialysate. Concomitant treatment included alfacalcidol (66% of patients) and sevelamer (34% of patients) as a standard phosphate binder. Group 3 patients had a lower dialysis vintage (53 +/- 66 vs. 73 +/- 85 months, P < .05), a higher number of diabetes patients (45% vs. 21%, P < .05), a higher number of female patients (53% vs. 28%, P < .05), and a higher level of intact parathyroid hormone (260 +/- 227 vs. 213 +/- 153 pg/mL, P < .05) than group 1 patients. No relationship was found between vitamin D storage levels and bone markers, serum calcium, phosphorus, albumin, body mass index, normalized protein catabolic rate, radiologic vascular calcification score, and hip bone mineral density. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, no factors were significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency.; Conclusions: Calcidiol deficiency was highly prevalent in a French dialysis population. The associated factors mainly included female sex, diabetes, shorter dialysis duration, and higher intact parathyroid hormone level. Although there are no guidelines for the therapy of patients with chronic kidney disease at stage 5, the usefulness of vitamin D supplementation may be assessed by considering its potential direct action, the need for providing fuel for renal and extrarenal calcitriol production in particular, and the numerous potential favorable effects on health.;

AB  - Vitamin K is essential for activation of γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla)-proteins including the vascular calcification inhibitor matrix Gla-protein (MGP). Insufficient vitamin K intake leads to production of uncarboxylated, mostly inactive proteins and contributes to an increased cardiovascular risk. In kidney transplant recipients, cardiovascular risk is high but vitamin K intake and status have not been defined. We investigated dietary vitamin K intake, vascular vitamin K status and its determinants in kidney transplant recipients. We estimated vitamin K intake in a cohort of kidney transplant recipients (n = 60) with stable renal function (creatinine clearance 61 [42-77] (median [interquartile range]) ml/min), who were 75 [35-188] months after transplantation, using three-day food records and food frequency questionnaires. Vascular vitamin K status was assessed by measuring plasma desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). Total vitamin K intake was below the recommended level in 50% of patients. Lower vitamin K intake was associated with less consumption of green vegetables (33 vs 40 g/d, p = 0.06) and increased dp-ucMGP levels (621 vs 852 pmol/L, p<0.05). Accordingly, dp-ucMGP levels were elevated (>500 pmol/L) in 80% of patients. Multivariate regression identified creatinine clearance, coumarin use, body mass index, high sensitivity-CRP and sodium excretion as independent determinants of dp-ucMGP levels. In a considerable part of the kidney transplant population, vitamin K intake is too low for maximal carboxylation of vascular MGP. The high dp-ucMGP levels may result in an increased risk for arterial calcification. Whether increasing vitamin K intake may have health benefits for kidney transplant recipients should be addressed by future studies.;

AB  - Background: Vitamin K modulates calcification by activating calcification inhibitors such as matrix Gla protein (MGP). In kidney transplant recipients, vitamin K insufficiency is common, but implications for long-term outcomes are unclear.; Study Design: Single-center observational study with a longitudinal design.; Setting& Participants: 518 stable kidney transplant recipients; 56% men; mean age, 51±12 (SD) years; and a median of 6 (IQR, 3-12) years after kidney transplantation.; Factor: Plasma desphosphorylated-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) levels, reflecting vitamin K status.; Outcomes: All-cause mortality and transplant failure.; Results: At inclusion, median dp-ucMGP level was 1,038 (IQR, 733-1,536) pmol/L, with 473 (91%) patients having vitamin K insufficiency (defined as dp-ucMGP>500pmol/L). During a median follow-up of 9.8 (IQR, 8.5-10.2) years, 152 (29%) patients died and 54 (10%) developed transplant failure. Patients in the highest quartile of dp-ucMGP were at considerably higher mortality risk compared with patients in the lowest quartile (HR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.87-5.12; P for trend<0.001; P for quartile 1 [Q1] vs Q4<0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, including kidney function and exclusion of patients treated with a vitamin K antagonist, this association remained significant. Patients in the highest quartile also were at higher risk of developing transplant failure (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.22-5.57; P for trend=0.004; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.01), but this association was lost after adjustment for baseline kidney function (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.52-2.75; P for trend=0.6; P for Q1 vs Q4=0.7).; Limitations: Although MGP exists as various species, only dp-ucMGP was measured. No data were available for vascular calcification as an intermediate end point.; Conclusions: Vitamin K insufficiency, that is, a high circulating level of dp-ucMGP, is highly prevalent in stable kidney transplant recipients and is associated independently with increased risk of mortality. Future studies should address whether vitamin K supplementation may lead to improved outcomes after kidney transplantation.; Copyright © 2015 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

AB  - Subclinical vitamin K deficiency is prevalent among renal transplant recipients and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the association between vitamin K supplementation and improvement of arterial stiffness has not been explored in the renal transplant population. The KING trial (vitamin K2 In reNal Graft) is a single-arm study that evaluated the association between the change in vitamin K status and indices of arterial stiffness following 8 weeks of menaquinone-7 (vitamin K2) supplementation (360 μg once daily) among renal transplant recipients (n = 60). Arterial stiffness was measured using carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Subclinical vitamin K deficiency was defined as plasma concentration of dephosphorylated-uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (dp-ucMGP) >500 pmol/L.At baseline, 53.3% of the study subjects had subclinical vitamin K deficiency. Supplementation was associated with a 14.2% reduction in mean cfPWV at 8 weeks (cfPWV pre-vitamin K2 = 9.8 ± 2.2 m/s vs. cfPWV post-vitamin K2 = 8.4 ± 1.5 m/s; P < .001). Mean dp-ucMGP concentrations were also significantly reduced by 55.1% following menaquinone-7 supplementation with a reduction in the prevalence of subclinical deficiency by 40% (P = .001). When controlled for age, durations of hemodialysis and transplantation, and the change in 24-hour mean arterial pressure, the improvement in arterial stiffness was independently associated with the reduction in dp-ucMGP concentration (P = .014).Among renal transplant recipients with stable graft function, vitamin K2 supplementation was associated with improvement in subclinical vitamin K deficiency and arterial stiffness.
