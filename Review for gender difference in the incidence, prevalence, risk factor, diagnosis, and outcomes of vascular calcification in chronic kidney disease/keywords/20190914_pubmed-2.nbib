TI  - [Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu-OC) bone metabolism and vascular
      calcification in hemodialyzed patients].
PG  - 703-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: Osteocalcin (OC) is witamino-K dependent calcium-binding protein
      comprising three gamma carboxy glutamic acid residues (Gla) which determines a
      strong bond with hydroxyapatite. In vitamin K deficiency and/or increased bone
      resorption undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu-OC) appears in the blood. The aim
      of this study was to evaluate the level of Glu-OC and markers of bone metabolism 
      and their impact on coronary artery calcification in patients with end-stage
      renal failure treated with repeated hemodialysis. The study included 68 patients 
      (29 women and 39 men) aged 60.3 +/- 12.3 years hemodialysis period 24.5 +/- 4.8
      months. Control group consisted of 35 healthy volunteers comparable in terms of
      age and gender. CACS was evaluated based on multislice spiral computed tomography
      (MSCT). Measurement of carboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-OC) and Glu-OC, bone
      alkaline phosphatase (bALP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5) were
      assessed by ELISA and iPTH by Nichols method. Present study demonstrated that the
      Gla-OC and Glu-OC in hemodialysis patients were significantly higher than the
      control group 116.37 +/- 70.01 ng/ml and 93.72 +/- 112.63 ng/ml versus 19.51 +/- 
      3.78 ng/ml and 4.88 +/- 2.63 ng/ ml; p <0.001. Glu-OC level correlated
      significantly with iPTH, bALP, TRAP5 (p <0.001) and CaSc (p <0.014). CONCLUSIONS:
      1. The results indicate a significant correlation between Glu-OC and assessed
      markers of bone metabolism. 2. Research has indicated a link between bone
      metabolism and the degree of calcification in the coronary arteries.

TI  - Vascular calcification in long-term kidney transplantation.
PG  - 251-6
LID - 10.1111/nep.12210 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and CKD-related risk
      factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and phosphate retention.
      Kidney transplantation improves kidney function and abnormal mineral metabolism
      at the same time. It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation favourably
      impacts VC in the long-term. METHODS: The present study examined VC in 132 kidney
      transplant (KT) recipients who had been transplanted for longer than one year.
      The severity of VC was compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney
      transplant (KT) waiting list. RESULTS: The median KT vintage was 88 months. The
      prevalence of VC among KT and CKD patients were 54.5% and 62.8%, respectively, (P
      = 0.2). There were no differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the
      prevalence of DM or CVD between the two groups. Among patients with
      calcification, a more severe degree was observed in KT recipients (P = 0.01).
      Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage were associated with significant VC in both
      groups. The degree of VC in KT recipients was more pronounced than that in CKD
      patients among those who experienced prolonged dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P =
      0.04). Among KT recipients, the severity of VC increased with the length of time 
      after transplantation and became more substantial after 5 years. CONCLUSIONS:
      Long-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe degree of VC compared to
      matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC became more pronounced among
      those with longer transplant vintage and was in part influenced by past dialysis 
      experience.

TI  - Evaluation of aortic calcification with lanthanum carbonate vs. calcium-based
      phosphate binders in maintenance hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus: an open-label randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 353-60
LID - 10.1111/1744-9987.12153 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis
      (HD) patients, especially with diabetes mellitus (DM) complications. No
      randomized studies have been published regarding the effect of lanthanum
      carbonate (LC) on VC progression in DM patients. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the effects of lanthanum carbonate on the progression of VC in HD
      patients with type 2 DM. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing LC 
      with calcium carbonate (CC) in 43 HD patients at a single dialysis center.
      Estimations of aortic calcification index (ACI) by abdominal computed tomography 
      were performed twice for each patient (at baseline and 12 months). Forty-one
      patients completed the study (19 LC, 22 CC). When ACI at baseline was <==0.48
      (median of baseline ACI), median change in ACI (Delta%ACI) was 20.44
      (11.50-36.80%) in the LC group, and 40.00 (33.30-92.60%) in the CC group (P =
      0.026). On the other hand, when ACI at baseline was >0.48, the median change in
      ACI (Delta%ACI) was 6.42 (3.13-24.40%) in the LC group, and 8.08 (5.68-12.20%) in
      the CC group (P = 1.000). Serum markers of chronic kidney disease-mineral and
      bone disorder (CKD-MBD), HbA1c, dose of vitamin D analogues, and side-effects of 
      medications did not change in either group throughout the study except int-PTH
      increased in the LC group. This study indicated that administration of LC
      inhibited the progression of VC in patients receiving HD for type 2 DM, only in
      cases of slight VC compared with CC.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Abdominal aortic calcification (AC) has been reported to be 
      associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in hemodialysis patients but is
      rarely discussed in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We examined the
      independent predictors and predictive power for survival of AC in prevalent PD
      patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: AC was detected by computed tomography (CT) and
      represented as the percentage of the total aortic cross-section area affected by 
      AC (%AC). The predictors of %AC >/= 15 were examined by multiple logistic
      regression analysis. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to determine the
      hazard ratios associated with high %AC. A total of 183 PD patients were recruited
      to receive CT scans and divided into group 1 (%AC < 15, n = 97), group 2 (%AC >/=
      15, n = 41), and group 3 (diabetic patients, n = 45). Group 1 patients had lower 
      osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels than group 2 patients (798 +/- 378 vs. 1308 +/- 1350
      pg/mL, p < 0.05). The independent predictors for %AC >/= 15 included the
      atherogenic index, OPG, and C-reactive protein (CRP). The age-adjusted hazard
      ratios associated with %AC >/= 15 were 3.46 (p = 0.043) for mortality and 1.90 (p
      = 0.007) for hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: %AC can predict mortality and
      morbidity in non-diabetic PD patients, and 15% is a good cut-off value for such
      predictions. There are complex associations among mineral metabolism,
      inflammation, and dyslipidemia in the pathogenesis of AC.

TI  - Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional computed
      tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 993-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0620-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In patients on dialysis, the most common cause of death is
      cardiovascular disease. This is caused, at least in part, by excessive vascular
      calcification. Studies that have examined coronary calcification have been
      published, but these measurements require expensive equipment. Here, we used
      computed tomography to determine aortic calcification and evaluated these data as
      prognostic markers for cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Computed tomography with 
      contrast medium was performed on 49 patients undergoing hemodialysis (29 males
      and 20 females; average age, 68.9 +/- 11.0 years). A calcification score (CS) was
      defined as the ratio of the volume of vascular calcification to the volume of the
      thoracic aorta. All patients were monitored for cardiovascular end points, which 
      included cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, myocardial infarction,
      electrocardiographic, or echocardiographic abnormalities that suggested
      myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery, leg amputation, and hospitalization or
      death due to heart failure. RESULTS: Patients were followed for 3 years, with 12 
      patients reaching the end point. Both high CS (p = 0.007) and male gender (p =
      0.009) were significantly associated with cardiovascular events. In contrast,
      events were not related to age, dialysis duration, diabetes mellitus, smoking
      status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, pulse-wave velocity, maximum
      intima-media thickness of the carotid artery wall, systolic blood pressure, or
      left ventricular hypertrophy. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that
      a high baseline CS was a significant predictor for cardiovascular events (p <
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by
      three-dimensional computed tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in
      patients on hemodialysis.

PG  - 2611-7
LID - 10.1111/jsm.12390 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Calciphylaxis, a rare obliterative small vessel vasculopathy
      associated with diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), portends 
      a poor prognosis. Because penile involvement is rare, agreement on appropriate
      diagnosis and management is unclear. AIM: To determine the role and effect of
      penile biopsy for diagnosis and management of penile calciphylaxis. METHODS:
      Medical records of three penile calciphylaxis patients from our institution were 
      evaluated. Data collected included age, history of DM, ESRD, and hemodialysis
      (HD) status, serum calcium (Ca), Ca x phosphorous product (C x P), parathyroid
      hormone (PTH), performance of biopsy, presence of non-penile cutaneous lesions,
      intervention, survival, and time from diagnosis to death. PubMed Search for
      relevant publications from 1995 to 2012 was performed to identify case reports of
      penile calciphylaxis that provided the same clinical data obtained from the 3
      patients from our institution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical evidence for
      outcomes in patients with penile calciphylaxis after biopsy of penile lesion
      compared to those without biopsy. RESULTS: A total of sixteen patients were
      identified in the literature and in our institution with clinical data of
      interest. Overall, 10/16 (62.5%) patients identified with penile calciphylaxis
      had a penile biopsy, and 7/10 (70%) experienced disease progression, while only
      3/10 (30%) stabilized. Mean time to death in this patient population was short,
      approximately 6.5 months, regardless of type of intervention. CONCLUSION: Based
      on the results of our study, we argue that conservative measures should be
      employed as first line therapy for penile calciphylaxis. More importantly,
      secondary to likely resultant progression of necrosis, penile biopsy is not only 
      unnecessary for diagnosis of penile calciphylaxis, but is also harmful and
      contraindicated.

TI  - Does hemodiafiltration reduce vascular stiffness measured by aortic pulse wave
      velocity compared with high-flux hemodialysis?
PG  - 391-5
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12119 [doi]
AB  - Hemodialfiltration (HDF) has been reported to reduce the frequency of
      intradialytic hypotension compared with hemodialysis (HD). We wished to determine
      whether HDF resulted in improvement of arterial stiffness compared with HD. We
      reviewed peripheral blood pressure and pulse wave velocity measurements in a
      cross-sectional analysis of stable HDF and HD outpatients. One hundred forty-one 
      HDF patients were matched to 148 HD patients in terms of age, sex, prevalence of 
      diabetes, peripheral blood pressure, and body mass. Pulse wave velocity was not
      different between the HD and HDF cohorts (median 9.1 [8.0-10.7] m/s vs. 9.7
      [8.5-11.6] m/s). Similarly, there were no differences in central aortic pressure 
      (149.2 +/- 30.9 mmHg vs. 151.9 +/- 35.2 mmHg), or aortic (39 [25.1-51.2]% vs.
      38.6 [25.8-51.4]%) and brachial (3.8 [-24.3 to 26.9]% vs. 3 [-22.4 to 27.1]%)
      augmentation indices, respectively. Pulse wave velocity did not differ between
      adult patients treated by HD and HDF, and similarly, there were no differences in
      central aortic pressure, aortic or brachial augmentation indices, and cardiac
      diastolic perfusion. Our study suggests that HDF does not appear to offer any
      benefit over HD in terms of vascular stiffness.

TI  - Magnesium intake is inversely associated with coronary artery calcification: the 
      Framingham Heart Study.
PG  - 59-69
LID - 10.1016/j.jcmg.2013.10.006 [doi]
LID - S1936-878X(13)00778-X [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine whether magnesium intake is
      associated with coronary artery calcification (CAC) and abdominal aortic
      calcification (AAC). BACKGROUND: Animal and cell studies suggest that magnesium
      may prevent calcification within atherosclerotic plaques underlying
      cardiovascular disease. Little is known about the association of magnesium intake
      and atherosclerotic calcification in humans. METHODS: We examined cross-sectional
      associations of self-reported total (dietary and supplemental) magnesium intake
      estimated by food frequency questionnaire with CAC and AAC in participants of the
      Framingham Heart Study who were free of cardiovascular disease and underwent
      Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) of the heart and abdomen (n = 2,695;
      age: 53 +/- 11 years), using multivariate-adjusted Tobit regression. CAC and AAC 
      were quantified using modified Agatston scores (AS). Models were adjusted for
      age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, fasting
      insulin, total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, use of hormone
      replacement therapy (women only), menopausal status (women only), treatment for
      hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease prevention, or diabetes, as 
      well as self-reported intake of calcium, vitamins D and K, saturated fat, fiber, 
      alcohol, and energy. Secondary analyses included logistic regressions of CAC and 
      AAC outcomes as cut-points (AS >0 and AS >/=90th percentile for age and sex), as 
      well as sex-stratified analyses. RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, a 50-mg/day
      increment in self-reported total magnesium intake was associated with 22% lower
      CAC (p < 0.001) and 12% lower AAC (p = 0.07). Consistent with these observations,
      the odds of having any CAC were 58% lower (p trend: <0.001) and any AAC were 34% 
      lower (p trend: 0.01), in those with the highest compared to those with the
      lowest magnesium intake. Stronger inverse associations were observed in women
      than in men. CONCLUSIONS: In community-dwelling participants free of
      cardiovascular disease, self-reported magnesium intake was inversely associated
      with arterial calcification, which may play a contributing role in magnesium's
      protective associations in stroke and fatal coronary heart disease.

TI  - Predicting risk of mortality in dialysis patients: a retrospective cohort study
      evaluating the prognostic value of a simple chest X-ray.
PG  - 263
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-263 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes of dialysis patients are variable, and improved
      knowledge of prognosis would inform decisions regarding patient management. We
      assessed the value of simple, chest X-ray derived measures of cardiac size
      (cardiothoracic ratio (CTR)) and vascular calcification (Aortic Arch
      Calcification (AAC)), in predicting death and improving multivariable prognostic 
      models in a prevalent cohort of hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Eight hundred and
      twenty-four dialysis patients with one or more postero-anterior (PA) chest X-ray 
      were included in the study. Using a validated calcification score, the AAC was
      graded from 0 to 3. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the
      association between AAC score, CTR, and mortality. AAC was treated as a
      categorical variable with 4 levels (0,1,2, or 3). Age, race, diabetes, and heart 
      failure were adjusted for in the multivariable analysis. The criterion for
      statistical significance was p<0.05. RESULTS: The median CTR of the sample was
      0.53 [IQR=0.48,0.58] with calcification scores as follows: 0 (54%), 1 (24%), 2
      (17%), and 3 (5%). Of 824 patients, 152 (18%) died during follow-up. Age, sex,
      race, duration of dialysis, diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and
      baseline serum creatinine and phosphate were included in a base Cox model. Both
      CTR (HR 1.78[1.40,2.27] per 0.1 unit change), area under the curve
      (AUC)=0.60[0.55,0.65], and AAC (AAC 3 vs 0 HR 4.35[2.38,7.66], AAC 2 vs 0 HR
      2.22[1.41,3.49], AAC 1 vs 0 HR 2.43[1.64,3.61]), AUC=0.63[0.58,0.68]) were
      associated with death in univariate Cox analysis. CTR remained significant after 
      adjustment for base model variables (adjusted HR 1.46[1.11,1.92]), but did not
      increase the AUC of the base model (0.71[0.66,0.76] vs. 0.71[0.66,0.76]) and did 
      not improve net reclassification performance (NRI=0). AAC also remained
      significant on multivariable analysis, but did not improve net reclassification
      (NRI=0). All ranges were based on 95% confidence intervals. CONCLUSIONS: Neither 
      CTR nor AAC assessed on chest x-ray improved prediction of mortality in this
      prevalent cohort of dialysis patients. Our data do not support the clinical
      utility of X-ray measures of cardiac size and vascular calcification for the
      purpose of mortality prediction in prevalent hemodialysis patients. More advanced
      imaging techniques may be needed to improve prognostication in this population.

TI  - [Risk factors for cardiovascular system damage in chronic kidney disease].
PG  - 69-76
AB  - AIM: To study the prevalence of and risk factors (RF) associated with
      cardiovascular system damage in patients with predialysis diabetic and
      nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation
      enrolled 317 patients with CKD of various etiologies. In Group 1 (165 patients
      with CKD: 54% of men, 46% of women; mean age 46 +/- 15 years), the glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR) was 37.2 ml/min; the serum creatinine level was 2.9 mg/dl. 
      Group 2 included 152 (41%) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (41% of
      men and 59% of women; mean age 57.3 +/- 7.1 years). The duration of DM averaged
      10.4 +/- 7.1 years. All the patients underwent physical examination; the levels
      of glycated hemoglobin and adipose tissue hormones, urinary albumin excretion
      were additionally determined in the diabetic patients. Echocardiography was
      performed in 172 patients. The influence of populationwide and renal
      failure-associated RFs on the cardiovascular system was evaluated in CKD.
      RESULTS: Clinical and instrumental examinations of 165 patients with Stages II-IV
      nondiabetic CKD revealed atherosclerosis of the aorta and the vessels of the
      heart, brain, kidney, and lower extremities in 60 (37%), 35 (24%), 30 (18%), 23
      (14%), and 8 (5%), respectively. As atherosclerotic vascular lesion progressed,
      the incidence of cardiovascular events (CVE) increased. Left ventricular
      hypertrophy (LVH) was diagnosed in 37.3% of the patients with nondiabetic CKD.
      Along with traditional cardiovascular RFs (age, smoking, gender, arterial
      hypertension), the renal dysfunction-related factors (anemia, diminished
      glomerular filtration rate, elevated creatitine levels, and abnormal phosphorus
      and calcium metabolism) are of importance. An association was found between LVH, 
      atherosclerotic vascular lesion, and heart valve calcification. According to
      EchoCG data, 36% of the patients with type 2 DM were diagnosed as having LVH. The
      RFs of the latter were albuminuria, obesity, and abnormal carbohydrate and purine
      metabolisms. There was an association of diabetic nephropathy with left

      development of cardiorenal syndrome is observed in early-stage CKD and related to
      both traditional and renal RFs.

TI  - Valvular calcification, inflammation, and mortality in dialysis patients.
PG  - 584-90
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The study aim was to determine the correlates of
      valvular calcification (VC), including clinical and physiologic parameters, in
      individuals new to dialysis. In addition, the association of VC with coronary
      artery calcification (CAC) progression and mortality was investigated. METHODS: A
      total of 101 incident dialysis individuals underwent electrocardiogram-triggered 
      multislice computed tomography (CT) to monitor the presence and quantification of
      calcification. The average follow up was 2.85 +/- 0.72 years. RESULTS: Twenty-six
      (25.7%) patients had only one valve calcified, while 10 (9.9%) had calcifications
      in both valves. Patients with VC were older, more likely to have a history of
      diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD), more likely to have CAC, and to be 
      Caucasian; fibrinogen and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were also higher in these
      patients. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis revealed older age, history
      of CVD, increasing fibrinogen, and presence of CAC were independently associated 
      with the presence of VC. Patients with VC also had a higher median annualized CAC
      progression compared to those without VC (2.90 versus 105.2, p = 0.004). The
      mortality rate per 100 years was 2.57 in patients without VC, compared to 4.20
      and 13.76, respectively, for those with one or two calcified valves. An
      increasing number of calcified valves was associated with a higher mortality
      after adjustment for gender and race [HR 2.2 (1.03-4.69), p = 0.04], but was not 
      statistically significant after adjustment for inflammatory markers such as IL-6 
      or fibrinogen. CONCLUSION: Traditional and novel risk factors are associated with
      the presence of VC, which is a risk marker for CAC progression and mortality in
      incident dialysis patients.

TI  - Arteriovenous fistula aneurysm in patients on regular hemodialysis: prevalence
      and risk factors.
PG  - 94-8
LID - 10.1159/000355548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Compared to all other complications, literature data about
      vascular access aneurysm (VAA) are the scarcest. The aim of this cross-sectional 
      study was to evaluate the prevalence of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) aneurysms and
      to confirm the risk factors for their appearance. METHODS: The presence, number
      and morphological characteristics of AVF aneurysms were confirmed, and according 
      to the score of AVF aneurysm (the sum of the length and width in cm), patients
      were classified into group 1 (score </=12) and group 2 (score >12). Analysis
      included the last data from the medical records including vascular calcifications
      score. RESULTS: Out of 181 patients, 150 with native fistula were included in
      this study. Aneurysmatic changes were detected in 90 (60%) patients, and the
      majority had two or more aneurysms. VAA were more frequent in patients with adult
      polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) than in other diagnostic categories. By using
      forward stepwise logistic regression, we confirmed that patients on high-flux
      hemodialysis (HD) had 5.3-fold higher risk, and patients with diabetes mellitus
      had 5.8-fold less risk for developing AVF aneurysm. While vascular calcification 
      score did not influence the incidence of VAA, higher PWV had significant negative
      influence on formation of AVF aneurysm (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.003-1.56, p = 0.047).
      By ROC curve analysis, it was determined that patients who were longer than 5.7
      years on HD had greater risk for developing VAA (area = 0.741, p = 0.000).
      CONCLUSION: This single-center study confirmed the very high prevalence of VAA
      (60%). Aneurysms were more frequent in patients with ADPKD and in those who had
      longer dialysis vintage on high-flux membranes with higher blood flow rate.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-241 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disordered mineral metabolism is implicated in the pathogenesis of
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Fibroblast growth factor 23
      (FGF-23) is the main regulator of phosphate metabolism. In this prospective
      study, we aimed to investigate the association of serum FGF-23 with progression
      of coronary artery calcification in HD patients. METHODS: Seventy-four HD
      patients (36 male/38 female, mean age: 52 +/- 14 years) were included. Serum
      FGF-23 levels were measured by ELISA. Coronary artery calcification score (CACS) 
      was measured twice with one year interval. Patients were grouped as progressive
      (PG) (36 patients-48%) and non-progressive (NPG). RESULTS: Age, serum phosphorus,
      baseline and first year CACS were found to be significantly higher in the PG
      compared to NPG group. Serum FGF-23 levels were significantly higher in PG [155
      (80-468) vs 147 (82-234), p = 0.04]. Patients were divided into two groups
      according to baseline CACS (low group, CACS </= 30; high group, CACS > 30). Serum
      FGF-23 levels were significantly correlated with the progression of CACS
      (DeltaCACS) in the low baseline CACS group (r = 0.51, p = 0.006), but this
      association was not found in high baseline CACS group (r = 0.11, p = 0.44). In
      logistic regression analysis for predicting the PG patients; serum FGF-23,
      phosphorus levels and baseline CACS were retained as significant factors in the
      model. CONCLUSIONS: Serum FGF-23 was found to be related to progression of CACS
      independent of serum phosphorus levels. FGF-23 may play a major role in the
      progression of vascular calcification especially at the early stages of
      calcification process in HD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between
      fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and vascular calcifications (VC) in
      peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed
      in 55 PD patients who underwent pelvic X-ray to assess for VC. Patients with and 
      without linear calcifications were recorded. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (27.3%)
      had linear calcifications on pelvic X-ray. FGF-23 levels were higher in patients 
      with VC (299.5 (30.4-2,410.0) vs. 74.4 (14.8-1,030) pg/ml, p < 0.01). Diabetic
      patients had lower FGF-23 values (43.2 (14.9-134.0) vs. 103.5 (14.8-2,410) pg/ml,
      p < 0.01). Patients with residual renal function (RRF) had lower FGF-23 levels
      (70.6 (14.8-513) vs. 179.5 (30.4-2,410) pg/ml, p = 0.06); however, this did not
      reach statistical significance. FGF-23 levels, age, creatinine, Ca, dialysis
      duration and HbA1c were positively correlated with VC, whereas RRF, Ca intake and
      ALP were negatively associated. Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed FGF-23
      levels, age, dialysis duration and RRF to be associated with VC. CONCLUSIONS:
      FGF-23 levels are associated with VC in PD patients. Further studies are needed
      to clarify whether it is simply a marker or a potential factor. It may prove to
      be an important therapeutic target for VC management.

AB  - AIM: To determine the associations between insulin resistance, fibroblast growth 
      factor 23 (FGF-23), and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) patients. INTRODUCTION: FGF-23 is associated with atherosclerosis
      and cardiovascular disease, but its association with insulin resistance in CKD
      has not been explored. SUBJECTS: Cross sectional study of 72 stage 3-5 CKD
      patients receiving care in Ontario, Canada. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Insulin
      resistance was measured by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
      (HOMA-IR), FGF-23 was measured by carboxyl terminal enzyme linked immunoassay
      (ctFGF-23) and CAC was measured by multi-slice computed tomography. RESULTS:
      Median HOMA-IR was 2.19muU/ml (interquartile range 1.19 to 3.94). Patients with
      HOMA-IR>2.2 had greater ctFGF-23 (179.7 vs 109.6; P=0.03), and 40% higher log CAC
      scores (2.09+/-0.87 vs 1.58+/-1.26; P=0.049). Multivariable linear regression
      adjusted for 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, kidney function, and parathyroid hormone
      revealed insulin resistance was a risk factor for greater log ctFGF-23 levels
      (log HOMA IR beta=0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.59; P=0.002).
      CONCLUSIONS: Insulin resistant CKD patients demonstrated higher FGF-23 levels,
      and increased CAC, while PO4 levels remained normal, suggesting a potential link 
      between insulin resistance and PO4 homeostasis in CKD.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-221 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality rates in
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23 levels and impaired 
      phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC. Therefore, their relative
      contribution to abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was examined in patients CKD
      stages 3-4. METHODS: Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila
      Index (KI), were studied in 178 patients. RESULTS: In multivariate linear
      analysis, AAC associated positively with age, male gender, CKD-stage, presence of
      carotid plaques (CP) and also with FGF23, but negatively with fractional
      excretion of phosphate (FEP). Intriguingly, FEP increased with similar slopes
      with elevations in PTH, with reductions in GFR, and also with elevations in FGF23
      but the latter only in patients with none (KI = 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack
      of a FEP-FGF23 correlation in patients with severe AAC (KI > 5) suggested a role 
      for an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 but not to PTH in AAC. Logistic
      and zero-inflated analysis confirmed the independent association of age, CKD
      stage, male gender and CP with AAC, and also identified a threshold FEP/FGF23
      ratio of 1/3.9, below which the chances for a patient of presenting severe AAC
      increased by 3-fold. Accordingly, KI remained unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios
      decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9 but markedly increased in parallel with further
      reductions in FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9. CONCLUSIONS: In CKD 3-4, an impaired
      phosphaturic response to FGF23 with FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9 associates with severe AAC 
      independently of age, gender or CP.

TI  - Parathyroidectomy reduces intradialytic hypotension in hemodialysis patients with
      secondary hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 323-31
LID - 10.1159/000350160 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with vascular
      calcification and arterial stiffness in patients with end-stage renal disease.
      The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of intradialytic hypotension
      (IDH) and cardiovascular function before and after parathyroidectomy (PTX) in
      maintenance hemodialysis patients. METHODS: We compared predialytic and
      intradialytic blood pressure, left and right ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 
      and RVEF), and cardiothoracic ratio 1 month before PTX, and 6 and 12 months after
      PTX. IDH was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure >/= 20 mmHg or a
      decrease in mean arterial pressure >/= 10 mmHg. RESULTS: At the time of PTX, the 
      mean age of the patients was 57.4 +/- 12.0 years, and the mean dialysis vintage
      was 12.2 +/- 5.8 years. At baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after PTX, the
      average numbers of sessions disturbed by IDH during 13 dialysis sessions (1
      month) were 6.4, 3.9 (p < 0.016 vs. baseline), and 4.0 sessions (p < 0.037 vs.
      baseline, p = 0.801 vs. 6 months), respectively. LVEF and RVEF were improved
      significantly after PTX. Furthermore, volume status was also improved, as
      evidenced by the significantly greater ultrafiltration volume and reduced
      cardiothoracic ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodialysis patients with severe secondary
      hyperparathyroidism are more likely to achieve normotensive and euvolemic status 
      after PTX, probably through improved heart function and reduced IDH episodes.

TI  - Association of dialysate calcium concentration with fetuin A level and carotid
      intima-media thickness in peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 65-8
LID - 10.3109/0886022X.2013.832309 [doi]
AB  - Serum fetuin A has been shown to be associated with the risk of vascular
      calcification and atherosclerosis, and it can predict the onset of cardiovascular
      mortality in dialysis patients. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is an
      accessible and reliable method to identify the subclinical atherosclerosis. The
      aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between dialysate calcium 
      concentrations and fetuin A or cIMT in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis
      (PD). Forty patients, newly diagnosed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and
      undergoing peritoneal dialysis, were enrolled in the study, with a calcium
      content of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution of 1.25 mmol/L in 20 patients
      (low-Ca group) and 1.75 mmol/L in 20 patients (standard-Ca group). The patients
      were followed up for 12 months after the PD conducted. Serum fetuin A was
      determined using a human fetuin A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and cIMT 
      was detected using ultrasonic wave. We observed no difference between two groups 
      with regard to the baseline data of fetuin A, cIMT, calcium, phosphorus,
      calcium-phosphorus product, high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), parathyroid hormone
      (PTH), or lipid parameters. After 12 months follow-up, fetuin A (263.92 +/- 16.1 
      vs. 282.76 +/- 21.0, p = 0.017) and calcium-phosphorus product (39.85 +/- 7.76
      vs. 47.50 +/- 6.65, p = 0.009) were obviously lower in the low-Ca group than
      standard-Ca group, the other serum parameters were not different between these
      two groups. Compared with baseline data, serum fetuin A concentration
      significantly reduced in low-Ca group ( p < 0.05). The number of patients with
      increased cIMT and newly occurring cardiovascular events in the low-Ca group were
      significantly reduced than standard-Ca group ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, our data
      suggest that low calcium dialysate treatment is associated with the decreased
      serum fetuin A concentration and serum calcium-phosphorus product, and it is
      associated with the reduced number of PD patients with increased cIMT or with
      newly occurring cardiovascular events. However, more studies with lager sample
      size should be performed in the future.

AB  - HIV-infected individuals suffer from accelerated aging, which manifests as
      premature cardiovascular and bone disease. However, little is known of the
      association of these two disorders in the HIV population. Our objective was to
      investigate the association between a marker of atherosclerosis (coronary artery 
      calcium [CAC]) and low bone mineral density (BMD) in a cross-sectional cohort of 
      HIV-infected patients. The study was conducted at the University of Modena and
      Reggio Emilia, Italy. A total of 636 consecutive middle-aged, HIV-infected
      subjects were recruited between January 2006 and December 2010. All patients
      underwent CAC and BMD assessment. Patients were categorized according to a CAC
      score <100 or >100 units based on previous literature that identified this
      cut-point as a marker of increased risk. Low femoral and lumbar spine BMD was
      defined as <25th percentile value for the study cohort. Logistic regression and
      bootstrap analysis were used to assess the independent association between CAC
      and BMD. The main outcome measure was a CAC score >100. Patients with CAC > 100
      were older and more likely to be men, diabetic, and overweight. Patients with CAC
      < 100 had better renal function and a lower cardiovascular risk profile. After
      adjusting for age, sex, traditional and HIV-specific risk factors, vitamin D
      level, and PTH level, there was a significant association between CAC > 100 and
      low BMD for the femur (OR = 2.33, 95 % CI 1.09-4.99; p = 0.02) but not for the
      spine. Bootstrap analyses confirmed these findings. In summary, CAC was
      independently associated with low femoral BMD in HIV-infected patients. Future
      studies should test whether therapies that attenuate cardiovascular risk in HIV
      favorably impact bone health.

TI  - Prevalence of vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications, and mortality in
      warfarin treated hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 248-58
AB  - Warfarin inhibits vitamin-K dependent proteins involved in bone mineralization
      and the prevention of vascular calcification (bone Gla protein BGP, matrix Gla
      protein MGP). In this multicenter, cross-sectional study with 3-year follow-up,
      data from 387 patients on hemodialysis for >/=1 year at 18 dialysis units were
      analyzed. Patients on warfarin treatment for > 1 year (11.9% of the population)
      were compared with the remaining cohort for vertebral fractures, vascular
      calcifications and mortality. Vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications
      were sought in L-L vertebral X-rays (D5 to L4). Compared with controls,
      warfarin-treated male patients had more vertebral fractures (77.8 vs. 57.7%,
      p<0.04), but not females (42.1% vs. 48.4%, p=0.6); total BGP was significantly
      reduced (82.35 vs. 202 microg/L, p<0.0001), with lower levels in treated men
      (69.5 vs. women 117.0 microg/L, p=0.03). In multivariate logistic regression
      analyses, the use of warfarin was associated with increased odds of aortic (OR
      2.58, p<0.001) and iliac calcifications (OR 2.86, p<0.001); identified
      confounders were age, atrial fibrillation, angina, PPI use and total BGP.
      Seventy-seven patients died during a 2.7+/-0.5 year follow-up. In univariate Cox 
      regression analysis, patients on warfarin had a higher risk of all-cause
      mortality (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42-4.16, p=0.001) when compared with those untreated
      and data adjustment for confounders attenuated but confirmed the significant
      warfarin-mortality link (HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.02-3.84, P=0.046). In hemodialysis
      patients, additional studies are warranted to verify the risk/benefit ratio of
      warfarin, which appears to be associated with significant morbidity and increased
      mortality.

TI  - The effects of rhBMP-2 and Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium in uremic patients
      with cardiovascular complication after maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 464-72
LID - 10.5301/ijao.5000217 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared the correlation of regulatory T cell (Treg) and Th17 cell
      function disequilibrium with calcification in uremic patients on maintenance
      hemodialysis (MHD) with healthy controls, and investigated if their influence
      possibly increased the development and outcome of cardiovascular complications in
      uremic patients after MHD. METHODS: The extent of coronary artery calcification
      was assessed by coronary artery calcification scoring (CACS) in uremic patients
      with and without adverse cardiovascular events after MHD (MHD group 1 vs. MHD
      group 2, respectively). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated with
      rhBMP-2 as positive control. The Treg/Th17 cell frequencies, Foxp3 ROR-gt mRNA
      expressions, and MIP 3alpha/CCL20 concentrations were measured. RESULTS: The CACS
      score was significantly higher in MHD group 1 as compared group 2. In comparison 
      with controls, rhBMP-2 upregulates Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium in uremic 
      patients, displayed higher Treg and Th17 frequencies, Foxp3 and ROR-gt
      expressions, and MIP3alpha/CCL20 concentrations. However, the up-regulations of
      Treg frequencies and Foxp3 expressions were significant in controls but not in
      MHD patients. It was also observed that Treg/Th17 functional disequilibrium was
      not only correlated with rhBMP-2 state but also consistent with the
      cardiovascular complications. Moreover, the CACS was negatively correlated with
      Treg cell frequencies but positively correlated with Th17 cell frequencies and
      MIP3a/CCL20 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Function disequilibrium of Treg/Th17 was
      related to the degree of the rhBMP-2 state. Function disequilibrium of the
      Treg/Th17 might act synergistically with rhBMP-2 in the high incidence of
      immune-mediated cardiovascular complications after MHD.

TI  - CT coronary angiography is feasible for the assessment of coronary artery disease
      in chronic dialysis patients, despite high average calcium scores.
PG  - e67936
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0067936 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Significant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in
      asymptomatic dialysis patients. Identifying these high risk patients is warranted
      and may improve the prognosis of this vulnerable patient group. Routine
      catheterization of incident dialysis patients has been proposed, but is
      considered too invasive. CT-angiography may therefore be more appropriate.
      However, extensive coronary calcification, often present in this patient group,
      might hamper adequate lumen evaluation. The objective of this study was to assess
      the feasibility of CT-angiography in this patient group. METHODS: For this
      analysis all patients currently participating in the ICD2 trial (ISRCTN20479861),
      with no history of PCI or CABG were included. The major epicardial vessels were
      evaluated on a segment basis (segment 1-3, 5-8, 11 and 13) by a team consisting
      of an interventional and an imaging specialist. Segments were scored as not
      significant, significant and not interpretable. RESULTS: A total of 70 dialysis
      patients, with a mean age of 66+/-8 yrs and predominantly male (70%) were
      included. The median calcium score was 623 [79, 1619]. Over 90% of the analyzed
      segments were considered interpretable. The incidence of significant CAD on CT
      was 43% and was associated with cardiovascular events during follow-up. The
      incidence of cardiovascular events after 2-years follow-up: 36% vs. 0% in
      patients with no significant CAD (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Despite the high calcium
      scores CT-angiography is feasible for the evaluation of the extent of CAD in
      dialysis patients. Moreover the presence of significant CAD on CT was associated 
      with events during follow-up.

TI  - Aortic calcifications and arterial stiffness as predictors of cardiovascular
      events in incident renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 973-81
LID - 10.1111/tri.12151 [doi]
AB  - Renal transplant recipients have an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV)
      disease. Arterial stiffness (AS) and aortic calcifications (ACs) are well-known
      CV risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease. We aimed to determine
      the prognostic value of AS and AC in incident renal transplant recipients (RTRs).
      We conducted a prospective study in 253 single RTR. AC were scored by means of
      lumbar X-ray. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed in a
      subgroup of 115 patients. AC were present in 61% of patients. After a mean
      follow-up of 36 months, 32 CV events occurred in the overall group and 13 events 
      in the PWV subgroup. When we accounted for age, gender, and CV history, AC score 
      (HR, hazard ratio 1.09 per 1 unit increase; 95% CI 1.02-1.17) and PWV (HR 1.45
      per 1 m/s; 95% CI 1.16-1.8) remained an independent predictor of CV events in
      Cox-regression analyses. Using receiver operating characteristics, the area under
      the curve for predicting CV events amounted to 0.80 and 0.72 for sum AC and PWV, 
      respectively. Both AS and AC are strong predictors of future CV events in an
      incident RTR population. These vascular assessments are readily available and
      easy to perform, making them ideal tools for further risk stratification.

TI  - Cardiovascular risk stratification in rheumatic diseases: carotid ultrasound is
      more sensitive than Coronary Artery Calcification Score to detect subclinical
      atherosclerosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 1764-70
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2013-203688 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of Coronary Artery Calcification Score (CACS)
      and carotid ultrasonography in detecting subclinical atherosclerosis in
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A set of 104 consecutive RA patients without 
      history of cardiovascular (CV) events were studied to determine CACS, carotid
      intima-media thickness (cIMT) and plaques. Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation
      (SCORE) modified according to the EULAR recommendations (mSCORE) was also
      assessed. RESULTS: The mean disease duration was 10.8 years, 72.1% had rheumatoid
      factor and/or anti-CCP positivity and 16.4% extra-articular manifestations. Nine 
      were excluded because they had type 2 diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney
      disease. CV risk was categorised in the remaining 95 RA patients according to the
      mSCORE as follows: low (n=21), moderate (n=60) and high/very high risk (n=14).
      Most patients with low mSCORE (16/21; 76.2%) had normal CACS (zero), and none of 
      them CACS>100. However, a high number of patients with carotid plaques was
      disclosed in the groups with CACS 0 (23/40; 57.5%) or CACS 1-100 (29/38; 76.3%). 
      72 (75.8%) of the 95 patients fulfilled definitions for high/very high CV as they
      had an mSCORE >/=5% or mSCORE <5% plus one of the following findings: severe
      carotid ultrasonography findings (cIMT>0.9 mm and/or plaques) or CACS>100. A
      CACS>100 showed sensitivity similar to mSCORE (23.6% vs 19.4%). In contrast, the 
      presence of severe carotid ultrasonography findings allowed identifying most
      patients who met definitions for high/very high CV risk (70/72; sensitivity 97.2%
      (95% CI 90.3 to 99.7)). CONCLUSIONS: Carotid ultrasonography is more sensitive
      than CACS for the detection of subclinical atherosclerosis in RA.

TI  - [Penultimate pulse wave velocity, better than baseline pulse wave velocity,
      predicted mortality in Italian ESRD cohort study - a case for daily hemodialysis 
      for ESRD patients with accelerated pulse wave velocity changes].
LID - gin/30.2.22 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac disease remains the major cause of death among ESRD patients.
      Indeed, the risk of cardiovascular events in ESRD is reported to be at least 3.4 
      fold higher than that of the general population. Moreover, annual mortality rates
      among ESRD patients on hemodialysis approximate 20%, with cardiovascular disease 
      accounting for almost half of this mortality profile. Despite this knowledge, so 
      far we have been unable to identify treatable pathogenetic factors among ESRD
      patients to help reverse these poor cardiovascular outcomes. The difficulty to
      prognosticate cardiovascular mortality in ESRD remains elusive. However, in 2011,
      our group, for the first time, had demonstrated that cyclic variations of
      arterial stiffness as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) before and after
      hemodialysis determined mortality differences within an ESRD cohort. We have
      therefore examined the impact of individual patient-level translational PWV
      changes over time on mortality outcomes in an Italian ESRD cohort. STUDY DESIGN
      AND SETTING: Prospective observational study, 2007-2010, in an Italian ESRD
      cohort who underwent in-center outpatient conventional thrice weekly
      hemodialysis. METHODS: PWV was measured by the foot-to-foot method and repeated
      after six months. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) was measured at 0, 12 and
      24 months. Routine clinical data and patient demographics were recorded and
      mortality outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2010, 466 Italian
      ESRD patients, 229 males and 237 females, age 19-97 (65.6) years, were followed
      up for 28.9 months. 128 patients (74M:54F) died. The major causes of death were
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in 47 (37%) patients (age 70, 26M:21F) and
      sudden death (SD) in 29 (23%) patients (age 72, 19M:10F). Paired PWV data was
      available in 308 surviving patients and in 106 patients who died. Baseline PWV
      was lower in surviving vs dead patients 8.46 +/- 1.8 vs 9.43 +/- 3.75 (p=0.0005).
      Repeat PWV values were unchanged in the 308 survivors (8.46 +/- 1.8 vs 8.53 +/-
      1.85, p=0.5, NS). Repeat PWV values increased in the 106 patients who died from
      9.43 +/- 3.75 to 12.11 +/- 4.18 (p<0.0001). Of the 29 patients who died from SD, 
      death occurred <12 hours after the last dialysis (ATLD) in 7, >24 hours ATLD in
      20 and >48 hours ATLD in 17. Of the 47 patients who died from AMI, 6 died <12
      hours ATLD, 35 died >24 hours ATLD and 23 died >48 hours ATLD. Of the 14 ESRD
      patients in the cohort that died from hyperkalemia, 3 died <12 hours ATLD, 11
      died >24 hours ATLD, and 7 died >48 hours ATLD. CAC data scatter did not allow
      for adequate statistical subgroup analysis but overall, baseline CAC values were 
      higher in the AMI/SD dead patients vs surviving patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is
      the first report to show a scalable and direct relationship between translational
      follow up PWV changes after six months versus observed cardiovascular mortality
      in an ESRD cohort. We have shown, for the first time, that penultimate PWV,
      better than baseline PWV, predicted cardiovascular mortality in this ESRD cohort.
      Moreover, higher proportions of the ESRD deaths from AMI, SD and hyperkalemia
      occurred during the long inter-dialytic (weekend) period when ESRD patients went 
      for 3 days without hemodialysis. We propose that PWV be monitored among all new
      ESRD patients, and be repeated after six months of initiation of chronic
      hemodialysis. Our group had earlier demonstrated in 2012 that daily dialysis
      reduced PWV in chronic hemodialysis patients. From these study findings, we have 
      proposed that ESRD patients who exhibit elevated initial PWV values, or more so, 
      ESRD patients who demonstrate accelerated PWV values after six months on
      maintenance chronic hemodialysis should be converted to daily hemodialysis
      protocol. Furthermore, such patients may require more intense cardiovascular
      analysis by cardiologists. Further research into new preventative or therapeutic 
      options in this area of ESRD care is warranted.

AB  - Whether kidney dysfunction is associated with coronary artery calcium (CAC) in
      young and middle-aged adults who have a cystatin C-derived estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFRcys) greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) is unknown. In the
      Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort (recruited in
      1985 and 1986 in Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; 
      and Oakland, California), we examined 1) the association of eGFRcys at years 10
      and 15 and detectable CAC over the subsequent 5 years and 2) the association of
      change in eGFRcys and subsequent CAC, comparing those with stable eGFRcys to
      those whose eGFRcys increased (>3% annually over 5 years), declined moderately
      (3%-5%), or declined rapidly (>5%). Generalized estimating equation Poisson
      models were used, with adjustment for age, sex, race, educational level, income, 
      family history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, body mass index, low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and tobacco use.
      Among 3,070 participants (mean age 35.6 (standard deviation, 4.1) years and mean 
      eGFRcys 106.7 (standard deviation, 18.5) mL/min/1.73 m(2)), 529 had detectable
      CAC. Baseline eGFRcys was not associated with CAC. Moderate eGFRcys decline was
      associated with a 33% greater relative risk of subsequent CAC (95% confidence
      interval: 5, 68; P = 0.02), whereas rapid decline was associated with a 51%
      higher relative risk (95% confidence interval: 10, 208; P = 0.01) in adjusted
      models. In conclusion, among young and middle-aged adults with eGFRcys greater
      than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), annual decline in eGFRcys is an independent risk factor
      for subsequent CAC.

TI  - Coronary calcifications and plaque characteristics in patients with end-stage
      renal disease: a computed tomographic study.
PG  - 501-8
LID - 10.1097/MCA.0b013e3283639eb3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the association between coronary artery calcifications,
      atherosclerotic burden, and plaque morphology in end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
      and non-ESRD patients undergoing 64-slice multidetector coronary computed
      tomographic angiography. METHODS: The prevalence, extent, and severity of
      coronary atherosclerosis, calcium burden, and plaque morphology were determined
      in ESRD patients (n=48), and calcium score-matched (n=39) and unmatched non-ESRD 
      controls (n=29) undergoing computed tomographic angiography using dedicated
      plaque imaging software. RESULTS: ESRD was associated with a higher prevalence of
      calcified plaques (55.9% vs. 38.3 and 26.9% in the non-ESRD groups, P=0.005) and 
      higher plaque calcium content (43.7 vs. 34.5% and 33.9%; P=0.003). Nonetheless,
      the calcium score correlated well with plaque burden (r=0.403 in ESRD vs. r=0.433
      in non-ESRD, P<0.001 for both), and the diagnostic association between the
      calcium score and atherosclerotic lesions was good irrespective of ESRD (area
      under the curve 0.771 vs. 0.804; P=0.574). CONCLUSION: ESRD is associated with
      diffuse atherosclerosis and calcific plaque morphology. Nonetheless, the
      association between the calcium score and atherosclerotic burden is not affected 
      by the presence of ESRD.

TI  - Recent advances in the noninvasive diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy.
PG  - 886-94
LID - 10.1038/ki.2013.254 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is the term used to
      describe a constellation of biochemical abnormalities, bone disturbances that may
      lead to fractures, and extraskeletal calcification in soft tissues and arteries
      seen in CKD. This review focuses on the noninvasive diagnosis of renal
      osteodystrophy, the term used exclusively to define the bone pathology associated
      with CKD. Transiliac bone biopsy and histomorphometry with double-labeled
      tetracycline or its derivatives remains the gold standard for diagnosis of renal 
      osteodystrophy. However, histomorphometry provides a 'window' into bone only at a
      single point in time, and is not clinically practical for studying continuous
      changes in bone morphology. Furthermore, the etiology of fractures in CKD is
      multifactorial and not fully explained by histomorphometry findings alone. The
      propensity of a bone to fracture is determined by bone strength, which is
      affected by bone mass and bone quality; the latter is a term used to describe the
      structure and composition of bone. Bone quantity is traditionally assessed by
      dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and CT-based methods. Bone quality is more
      difficult to assess noninvasively, but newer techniques are emerging and are
      described in this review. Ultimately, the optimal diagnostic strategy for renal
      osteodystrophy may be a combination of multiple imaging techniques and biomarkers
      that are specific to each gender and race in CKD, with a goal of predicting
      fracture risk and optimizing therapy.

TI  - Sclerostin: Another vascular calcification inhibitor?
PG  - 3221-8
LID - 10.1210/jc.2013-1521 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist produced by osteocytes, regulates
      osteoblast activity and is a well-established key player in bone turnover. Recent
      data indicate that the Wnt pathway may also be involved in vascular
      calcification. OBJECTIVE: The present study tests the hypothesis that serum
      sclerostin levels are associated with vascular calcification in patients with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet receiving dialysis. DESIGN, SETTING,
      PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis in 154
      patients with CKD. Aortic calcification (AC) was assessed by lumbar X-ray and
      scored with a maximum score of 24. In addition to traditional and nontraditional 
      cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, serum sclerostin levels were assessed (ELISA). 
      Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of serum sclerostin
      and AC. RESULTS: AC was present in 59% of patients. Older age (P < .0001), male
      sex (P = .006), lower estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) (P = .0008), lower
      bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = .03), and the absence of AC (P = .006)
      were identified as independent determinants of higher serum sclerostin levels. In
      univariate logistic regression, higher age, diabetes, CV history, higher body
      mass index, higher serum C-reactive protein and sclerostin levels and lower
      estimated glomerular rate were all associated with the presence of AC. In
      multivariate analysis, lower, not higher, sclerostin levels (P = .04, odds ratio 
      [OR] per ng/mL of 0.24), higher age (P < .0001, OR per year of 1.17) and CV
      history (P = .02, OR for a positive CV history of 3.83) were identified as
      independent determinants of AC. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with CKD,
      we found that patients with aortic calcifications (ACs) had higher sclerostin
      levels. However, in multivariate analysis, the association became inverse.
      Additional clinical and experimental studies are urgently required to clarify
      whether or not sclerostin protects against progression of vascular calcification.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of abdominal aortic calcification in healthy living
      kidney donors.
PG  - 63-70
LID - 10.1007/s11255-013-0485-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification (VC) is common and is both a marker and a
      cause of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially so in
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Renal transplantation is the cornerstone
      of the successful long-term management of CKD, and in order to satisfy
      transplantation needs, more use is made now of living kidney donors (LKD). Prior 
      to selection for transplantation, much screening of potential LKD takes place,
      including for cardiovascular issues. It is not known; however, how much these
      potentially healthy LKD may be prone to clinically silent VC. METHODS: We
      identified 103 living kidney donors from 2011 renal transplant records. Abdominal
      aortic calcification (AAC) was assessed using existing abdominal CT imaging using
      multi-channel CT aortograms (used primarily to assess renal vascular anatomy).
      Using these CT scans, manual calcium scoring was undertaken to calculate total
      aortic calcium load (AAC severity score). The prevalence, severity and
      associations of AAC between calcified and non-calcified donors were then
      compared. RESULTS: A total of 103 donors were identified from records. Ninety
      three of these had detailed clinical records to complement their CT scans. Fifty 
      of ninety-three donors were male, and the mean age was 45.9 +/- 1.8 years. Mean
      MDRD eGFR was 88.73 +/- 2.97 ml/min/1.73 m(2). 7.14 +/- 3.07 % of the aorta in
      these donors was calcified with a mean AAC severity score of 0.98 +/- 0.56. In
      kidney donors >50 years of age, there was significantly more AAC than in those
      <50: 2.47 +/- 1.56 versus 0.31 +/- 0.29, p < 0.001. There was no relationship
      between the presence or severity of aortic VC and donor GFR, systolic blood
      pressure, pulse pressure, calcium-phosphate product or smoking. CONCLUSIONS: AAC 
      prevalence, patterns and severity in this important donor population have not
      previously been described in the literature. There was relatively little VC in
      what would be regarded as a "healthy" donor population. VC was more common with
      age, but the other possible risk factors for the presence or severity of VC did
      not impact on overall AAC scores. VC did not influence vascular stiffness as
      represented by pulse pressure. Following the evolution of AAC over time in those 
      who have donated a kidney, and lost some global renal function as a consequence, 
      would be of considerable interest.

      atherosclerosis in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 122
LID - 10.1186/1471-2369-14-122 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains excessive in patients 
      with chronic kidney disease. The association of vascular changes with regulators 
      of extraosseous calcification in this patient population is still under
      investigation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations
      of the calcification inhibitor fetuin-A, and the anti-osteoclastic factor
      osteoprotegerin (OPG) with vascular pathology in chronic hemodialysis patients.
      METHODS: In this cross-sectional study including 81 stable chronic hemodialysis
      patients, we measured carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) with
      applanation tonometry, reflecting arterial stiffness, and common carotid
      intima-media thickness (ccIMT), a surrogate of early atherosclerosis, as well as 
      serum levels of fetuin-A and OPG. Co-morbidities, traditional cardiovascular risk
      factors, inflammatory markers and mineral-bone disease serology parameters were
      also recorded. RESULTS: cfPWV correlated inversely with fetuin-A (r=-0.355,
      p=0.001) and positively with OPG (r=0.584, p<0.001). In multilinear regression
      analysis including age, gender, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension,
      pulse pressure, LDL, logCRP, both fetuin-A and OPG were independently associated 
      with cfPWV (p=0.024 and p=0.041 respectively). ccIMT was negatively associated
      with fetuin-A (r=-0.312, p=0.005) and positively with OPG (r=0.521, p<0.0001);
      however these associations lost statistical significance after adjustment for
      age. CONCLUSION: In chronic hemodialysis patients both fetuin-A and OPG levels
      are independently associated with arterial stiffness but not with early
      atherosclerotic vascular changes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) are prone to neointimal hyperplasia
      leading to AVG failure. We hypothesized that pre-existing pathologic
      abnormalities of the vessels used to create AVGs (including venous intimal
      hyperplasia, arterial intimal hyperplasia, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial
      calcification) are associated with inferior AVG survival. STUDY DESIGN:
      Prospective observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic
      kidney disease undergoing placement of a new AVG at a large medical center who
      had vascular specimens obtained at the time of surgery (n = 76). PREDICTOR:
      Maximal intimal thickness of the arterial and venous intima, arterial medial
      fibrosis, and arterial medial calcification. OUTCOME & MEASUREMENTS: Unassisted
      primary AVG survival (time to first intervention) and frequency of AVG
      interventions. RESULTS: 55 patients (72%) underwent interventions and 148 graft
      interventions occurred during 89.9 years of follow-up (1.65 interventions per
      graft-year). Unassisted primary AVG survival was not associated significantly
      with arterial intimal thickness (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.40-1.27; P = 0.3), venous
      intimal thickness (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37-1.10; P = 0.1), severe arterial medial 
      fibrosis (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-1.06; P = 0.6), or severe arterial calcification
      (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.37-1.31; P = 0.3). The frequency of AVG interventions per
      year was associated inversely with arterial intimal thickness (relative risk
      [RR], 1.99; 95% CI, 1.16-3.42; P < 0.001 for thickness <10 vs. >25 mum), venous
      intimal thickness (RR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.39-3.20; P < 0.001 for thickness <5 vs.
      >10 mum), arterial medial fibrosis (RR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.96-5.13; P < 0.001 for
      fibrosis <70% vs. >/=70%), and arterial calcification (RR, 2.12; 95% CI,
      1.31-3.43; P = 0.001 for <10% vs. >/=10% calcification). LIMITATIONS:
      Single-center study. Study may be underpowered to demonstrate differences in
      unassisted primary AVG survival. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing vascular pathologic
      abnormalities in patients with chronic kidney disease may not be associated
      significantly with unassisted primary AVG survival. However, vascular intimal
      hyperplasia, arterial medial fibrosis, and arterial calcification may be
      associated with a decreased frequency of AVG interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
      (PAI-1), tissue type plasminogen activator (t-PA), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) on the
      atherosclerosis progress in the maintenance hemodialysis patients. METHODS: We
      enrolled 19 patients with maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and 11 healthy people as
      control. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their age above or
      below 40 years old (11 and 8 in each, respectively), whereas the subjects in
      control group were below 40 years old. All the clinical information of the
      research subjects was collected: including age, gender, time of hemodialysis,
      blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCr).
      Immunohistochemistry and pathological image analysis were used to investigate the
      pathological changes, calcification and the expression of PAI-1, t-PA, and ET-1
      on the blood vessel. RESULTS: Compared with the age-matched healthy control
      group, there were higher blood vascular media thickness, blood vascular media
      thickness/diagmeter ratio, blood vascular media thickness area/vascular
      inter-wall area ratio (P<0.05) and more calcification (P<0.05) in the the
      internal iliac artery in the chronic renal failure MHD patients. All the results 
      were similar when compared the above 40 years old group with the below 40 years
      old one in the chronic renal failure MHD patients. There were positive
      correlation of blood vascular media thickness with age and blood pressure
      (P<0.05). Expression of PAI-1, ET-1, t-PA on the internal iliac artery vessel was
      elevated in the chronic renal failure MHD patients compared with the health
      control (P<0.05). The level of PAI-1 or ET-1 was much higher in the above 40
      years old group than the below 40 years old one in the chronic renal failure MHD 
      patients, whereas there was no significant difference in the t-PA expression
      between the 2 groups (P<0.05). There were positive correlation of PAI-1 or ET-1
      expression with age and blood pressure (P<0.05). There were positive correlation 
      of PAI-1 or ET-1 expression with blood vascular media thickness and calcification
      (P<0.05 or P<0.01). There was no correlation of hemodialysis time with blood
      vascular media thickness, calcification, PAI-1, t-PA, or ET-1 expressions.
      CONCLUSION: MHD patients accompany with atherosclerosis which is severer in the
      patients above 40 years old than the patients below 40 years old. The higher of
      the blood pressure, the severer of the atherosclerosis. Abnormal expression of
      PAI-1 plays an important role in the progress of the atherosclerosis in the
      chronic renal failure MHD patients, whereas t-PA has no function in this process.
      The level of PAI-1 and ET-1 would be helpful to evaluating the degree of
      atherosclerosis in the chronic renal failure MHD patients. Hemodialysis time may 
      not be a potential accelerator for atherosclerosis progression.

AB  - The impact of lesion calcium on long-term outcomes after drug-eluting stent
      implantation has not been adequately addressed. In 10,595 patients (16,803
      lesions) who were exclusively treated with sirolimus-eluting stents in the
      j-Cypher registry, 5-year outcomes were compared between patients with >/=1
      lesion with moderate or severe calcification (the calcium group) and those with
      noncalcified lesions only (the noncalcium group). Analyses were stratified by
      hemodialysis (HD) status (non-HD stratum [calcium n = 3,191, noncalcium n =
      6,824] and HD stratum [calcium n = 415, noncalcium n = 165]). Adjusted risk in
      the calcium group for death and target lesion revascularization was significant
      in the non-HD stratum (hazard ratio [HR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 
      to 1.52, p <0.0001, and HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.36, p = 0.003) and the HD
      stratum (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.86, p = 0.02, and HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.36,
      p <0.0001). Risk for definite stent thrombosis tended to be higher in the calcium
      group in the HD stratum (HR 5.05, 95% CI 0.66 to 38.9, p = 0.12) but not in then 
      non-HD stratum (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.67, p = 0.41). The use of rotational
      atherectomy in patients with severe calcification did not have a significant
      impact on the cumulative incidence of target lesion revascularization in the
      non-HD stratum (17.7% [n = 268] with vs 18.2% [n = 588] without rotational
      atherectomy, p = 0.68) and the HD stratum (54.7% [n = 115] with vs 51.9% [n =
      118] without rotational atherectomy, p = 0.19). In conclusion, regardless of HD
      status, patients with calcified lesions have increased long-term risk for death
      and target lesion revascularization after sirolimus-eluting stent implantation.

TI  - Influence of peritoneal dialysis solution biocompatibility on long-term survival 
      of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and the technique
      itself.
PG  - 352-62
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Morbidity and mortality of continous ambulatory peritoneal
      dialysis (CAPD) patients is still very high. The aim of the study was to evaluate
      the effects of peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions (standard vs biocompatible) on 
      long-term patients' and the techique survival. METHODS: A total of 42 stable
      patients on CAPD participated in this cross-sectional study. They were
      prospectively followed-up during the twelve years. Patients with severe anemia
      (Hb < 10 g/L) and malignant disease ware excluded. Twenty one (50%/0) patients
      were treated with the standard PD solutions (CAPDP-1) while the other 21 (500/0) 
      were treated with biocompatible PD solutions [(lower level of glucose degradation
      products, lower concentration of Ca(2+) and neutral pH (CAPDP-2)]. All patients
      were analyzed for a presence of vascular calcification, nutrition status, and
      parameters of inflammation after 2.5 +/- 0.6 years of starting CAPD, and these
      variables considered in the analysis as risk factors. RESULTS: The patients from 
      the group CAPDP-2 compared to those from the group CAPDP-1 had lower level of
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (p = 0.003), and better nutritional 
      status as confirmed by the mid-arm circumference (p = 0.015), and mid-arm muscle 
      circumference (p = 0.002) and subjective global assessment (p = 0.000). Also,
      they had lower vascular calcifications as confirmed by intima media thickness
      (IMT) (p = 0.003), degree of carotid narrowing (p = 0.001) and calcified plaques 
      of common carotid arteries (CCA) (p = 0.008). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed
      better survival of patients from the group CAPDP-2 than those from the group
      CAPDP-1 (1-, 5-, and 10-year patients survival rate was: 100%, 61.9% and 14.3%
      for the group CAPDP-1, and 100%, 85.7%, and 52.4% for the group CAPDP-2,
      respectively; p = 0.0345). The 1-, 5-, and 10-year technique survival rate was:
      100%, 71.4%, and 38.1% for the group CAPDP-1, and 100%, 85.7%, and 76.2% for the 
      group CAPDP-2, respectively; (p = 0.0719). Duration of dialysis, serum
      triglyceride and cardiovascular score (quantitative scoring system consisting of:
      ejection fraction (EF) of left ventricle < 50%; IMT > 1 mm; carotid narrowing
      degree > 50%, presence of carotid plaques in both common carotide, ischaemic
      heart disease, cerebrovascular event and peripheral vascular disease with or
      without amputation) were independent predictors of overall patient survival.
      Duration of dialysis was only independent predictor of overall technique
      survival. CONCLUSION: Although patients treated with biocompatible solutions
      showed significantly better survival, the role of biocompatibility of CAPD
      solutions in patients and technique survival have to be confirmed. Namely,
      multivariate analysis confirmed that duration of dialysis, serum triglyceride and
      cardiovascular score significantly predicted overall CAPD patients survival,
      while only duration of dialysis was found to be independent predictor of overall 
      techique survival.

TI  - Lanthanum carbonate delays progression of coronary artery calcification compared 
      with calcium-based phosphate binders in patients on hemodialysis: a pilot study.
PG  - 439-46
LID - 10.1177/1074248413486355 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with
      future cardiovascular events and/or death of patients on hemodialysis (HD). We
      investigated whether progression of CAC in patients on HD could be delayed by
      switching from a calcium (Ca)-based phosphate (Pi) binder to lanthanum carbonate.
      DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: The CAC scores were evaluated at
      study enrollment and after 6 months in 52 patients on HD using calcium carbonate 
      (CC) as a Pi binder. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups assigned to
      receive either CC or lanthanum carbonate (LC), and the CAC scores were evaluated 
      after a 6-month treatment period. Progression of CAC was assessed, as were serum 
      levels of Ca, Pi, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). RESULTS: Forty-two
      patients completed the study (23 receiving CC and 19 receiving LC). In the 6
      months prior to randomization, all patients were treated with CC. During this
      6-month period, the CAC scores increased significantly in all 42 patients. Once
      randomized, there was significantly less progression in the group treated with LC
      than with CC. Changes in CAC scores from 6 to 12 months were significantly
      smaller in the LC group than the CC group (-288.9 +/- 1176.4 vs 107.1 +/- 559.6, 
      P = .036), and percentage changes were also significantly different (-6.4% vs
      41.2%, P = .024). Serum Ca, Pi, and iPTH levels were similar in both groups
      during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggested that LC delayed 
      progression of CAC in patients on HD compared with CC.

TI  - Sclerostin: another bone-related protein related to all-cause mortality in
      haemodialysis?
PG  - 3024-30
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gft039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Derangements in bone metabolism and vascular calcification (VC)
      substantially contribute to the accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wnt signalling pathway is
      increasingly recognized to play an important role in bone homeostasis and VC.
      Circulating levels of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin are elevated in CKD patients. 
      The present study investigated whether the circulating levels of sclerostin are
      associated with all-cause mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We
      performed a post-hoc survival analysis in 100 prevalent HD patients (68 +/- 13
      years, 40 male) recruited in 2006 who were prospectively followed for median 637 
      (8-1000, range) days. Parameters of mineral metabolism including bone-specific
      alkaline phosphatase (bsAP) and serum sclerostin were determined in spare blood
      samples collected at baseline. RESULTS: Serum concentrations of serum sclerostin 
      amounted to 110 (82-151) [median (iqr)] pmol/L. Patients with sclerostin levels
      above median were characterized by older age, higher haemoglobin and creatinine
      level and lower bsAP concentration. During a median follow-up of 637 days, 31
      patients died. Higher circulating sclerostin levels were associated with
      decreased mortality in prevalent HD patients: unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.51
      (0.24-1.06) (P = 0.06); HR adjusted for age and gender for serum sclerostin
      levels above versus below median was 0.33 (0.15-0.73) (P = 0.006). When bsAP was 
      entered in the Cox regression analysis, it replaced sclerostin in the final
      model. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that high circulating sclerostin levels are
      associated with improved survival and suggest that a low bsAP activity may be in 
      the causal pathway.

TI  - Mineral and bone disease in black african hemodialysis patients: a report from
      senegal.
PG  - 613-6
LID - 10.5812/numonthly.4225 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease related mineral and bone disease (CKD-MBD) is 
      a worldwide challenge in hemodialysis patients. In Senegal, number of dialysis
      patients is growing but few data are available about their bone disorders.
      OBJECTIVES: To describe patterns of CKD-MBD in Senegalese dialysis patients.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study including patients
      from three dialysis centres in Senegal. Diagnosis of different types of CKD-MBD
      relied on clinical, biological and radiological data collected from medical
      records in dialysis. RESULTS: We included 118 patients and 79 of them presented
      CKD-BMD (prevalence of was 66.9 %). Mean age of CKD-MBD patients was 47.8 +/-
      15.7 years (16-81 years) and sex-ratio (Male/Female) was 1.15. Secondary
      hyperparathyroidism was the most frequent disorder (57 patients) followed by
      adynamic bone disease (21 patients) and osteomalacia (1 patients). The main
      clinical manifestations were bone pain (17.5% of cases), pruritus (36.8% of
      cases) and pathological fractures (2.5% of cases). Bone biopsy was not available.
      Valvular and peripheral vascular calcification were present in 24.5% and 21.2% of
      patients respectively. Management of CKD-MBD included optimization of dialysis,
      calcium bicarbonate, sevelamer, vitamin D analogues and calcimimetics. The
      NKF/DOQI recommended levels of serum calcium, phosphate and parathormone PTH were
      not achieved in one third of patients. Six patients presented major
      cardiovascular events during their dialysis period. CONCLUSIONS: CKD-MBD are
      frequent in Senegalese hemodialysis patients and they are dominated by high
      turn-over disease. Clinical and biological manifestations are unspecific and
      accurate diagnoses are often difficult in absence of histomorphometry. Treatment 
      is suboptimal for many patients in a context of limited resources.

PG  - 617-23
LID - 10.7150/ijms.5773 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the prognostic value of the aortic calcification 
      index (ACI), an estimate of abdominal aortic calcification by plain abdominal
      computed tomography (CT), in terms of left ventricular (LV) diastolic
      dysfunction, mortality, and nonfatal cardiovascular (CV) events in peritoneal
      dialysis (PD) patients. METHOD: PD patients who received both abdominal CT and
      echocardiography were divided into a low-ACI group (n=46) and a high-ACI group
      (n=46). RESULTS: During follow-up (median, 35.2 months; range, 3.6-111.3), 30
      patients (32.6%) died and 10 patients (10.9%) developed nonfatal cardiovascular
      (CV) events. The 5-year event-free survival rates for mortality and nonfatal CV
      events were significantly lower in the high-ACI group compared with those in the 
      low-ACI group (35.7% vs. 64.1%, P = 0.01). The ACI was positively correlated with
      left atrial diameter and ratio of peak early transmitral flow velocity to peak
      early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/E' ratio; a marker of left ventricular
      diastolic function). Using multivariate analyses, the high-ACI group (vs. low-ACI
      group, HR 5.25, 95% CI 1.77-15.58, P = 0.003) and increased E/E' ratio (HR 1.16, 
      95% CI 1.03-1.31, P = 0.013) were independent predictors for mortality and CV
      events. The ACI provided a higher predictive value for adverse outcomes (AUC =
      0.755, P = 0.002) than the E/E' ratio (AUC = 0.543, P = 0.61). CONCLUSION: The
      ACI was significantly associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and 
      predicted all-cause mortality and nonfatal CV events in PD patients.

TI  - Polymorphism in the human matrix Gla protein gene is associated with the
      progression of vascular calcification in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 882-9
LID - 10.1007/s10157-013-0785-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is one of the important proteins inhibiting 
      vascular calcification (VC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in
      the promoter and coding regions of the MGP gene affect the transcriptional
      activity. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the SNPs and
      progression of VC in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). METHODS:
      This was a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study of 134 MHD patients whose VC 
      could be followed by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) examinations.
      MGP-SNPs (T-138C, rs1800802 and G-7A, rs1800801) were determined. The progression
      speed of VC was examined by plotting the abdominal aortic calcium volume scores. 
      RESULTS: The progression speed of VC of patients with the CC genotype of T-138C
      was significantly slower than that of patients with the CT or TT genotype.
      Multiple regression analysis showed that CT/TT genotype, greater age at the
      beginning of MHD, male sex, high levels of calcium x phosphate, low levels of
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high levels of low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol, low levels of ferritin and non-use of angiotensin II receptor
      blockers were significantly associated with progression of VC. CONCLUSIONS: The
      MGP-138CC genotype may be associated with slower progression of VC in MHD
      patients. The genotype of the MGP gene will be a genomic biomarker that is
      predictive of VC progression.

TI  - High prevalence of vertebral fractures assessed by quantitative morphometry in
      hemodialysis patients, strongly associated with vascular calcifications.
PG  - 39-47
LID - 10.1007/s00223-013-9722-x [doi]
AB  - Few studies have provided information on the prevalence of vertebral fractures
      (VFs) and their risk factors in hemodialysis patients. A multicenter,
      cross-sectional, observational study was carried out to assess the prevalence of 
      VFs and vascular calcifications (VCs) in 387 hemodialysis patients (mean age 64.2
      +/- 14.1 years, 63 % males) and in a control group of 51 osteoporotic subjects.
      Biochemical tests included 25(OH) vitamin D, bone Gla protein (total and
      undercarboxylated), and total matrix Gla protein. Vertebral quantitative
      morphometry was carried out centrally for the detection of VF, defined as
      reduction by >/=20 % of one of the vertebral body dimensions. In the same
      radiograph, aortic and iliac VC scores were calculated. Prevalence of VF was 55.3
      % in hemodialysis patients and 51.0 % in the control group. Multivariate analysis
      disclosed that male gender (59.8 vs. 47.6 %, p = 0.02; OR = 1.78, 95 % CI
      1.15-2.75) and age (mean +/- SD 66.7 +/- 13.1 vs. 61.0 +/- 14.7 years, p < 0.001;
      OR = 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05) were significantly associated with VF. The
      prevalence of aortic VC was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients than in
      controls (80.6 vs. 68.4 %, p = 0.001). The factors with the strongest association
      with VC, apart from atrial fibrillation, were serum 25(OH)vitamin D levels below 
      29 ng/mL for aortic VC (OR = 1.85, 95 % CI 1.04-3.29) and VF both for aortic (OR 
      = 1.77, 95 % CI 1.00-3.14) and iliac (OR = 1.96, 95 % CI 1.27-3.04) VC. In
      conclusion, the prevalence of VF, especially in males, and VC, in both genders,
      is high in hemodialysis patients. VF is associated with VC. Vitamin D deficiency 
      is also associated with VC. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to
      investigate fractures in renal patients.

TI  - Human uraemic serum displays calcific potential in vitro that increases with
      advancing chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 237-45
LID - 10.1042/CS20120638 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) strongly correlates with declining renal function and
      contributes to the high morbidity and mortality of patients with CKD (chronic
      kidney disease). It is closely regulated by circulating factors but little is
      known about the capacity of serum from patients to induce calcification outside
      the disease setting, which we now define as the calcific potential of serum. We
      have therefore examined the ability of serum from age- and sex-matched subjects
      with and without advancing CKD to induce calcification of cultured SMCs (smooth
      muscle cells). Samples from patients with CKD induced significant calcification
      compared with controls. More importantly, samples from patients on haemodialysis 
      induced significantly higher calcification than those with moderate or advanced
      CKD. The calcification induced by the latter two but not those on haemodialysis
      could be enhanced with calcium chloride and beta-GP (beta-glycerophosphate). A
      positive correlation was evident between measured serum creatinine, phosphate,
      PTH (parathyroid hormone), OPG (osteoprotegerin) and the degree of calcification 
      in vitro. eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), DBP (diastolic blood
      pressure), haemoglobin and serum albumin correlated negatively. Stepwise
      multivariate analysis of log-transformed calcific potential data highlighted
      serum creatinine, albumin and OPG as significant predictors, explaining
      approximately 50% of the variation. Thus, other regulators, either not
      investigated or as yet unidentified, may contribute to the calcification
      potential of serum in vitro. Furthermore, uraemic serum can induce graded
      calcification outside of the disease milieu that reflects the degree of kidney
      impairment in vivo. These findings could have important clinical relevance in
      terms of developing novel diagnostic and/or therapeutic strategies for subjects
      with CKD.

PG  - 16-21
LID - 10.1159/000345172 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated arterial aging and inadequate outward arterial remodeling
      are observed in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Whether these changes
      could be closely associated with arterial calcifications has never been
      investigated. METHODS: 155 ESRD patients and 105 age-, sex-, and blood
      pressure-matched control subjects were included. Common carotid artery (CCA)
      pressure, diameter, intima-media thickness, elastic modulus, and presence of
      calcified plaques were measured ultrasonographically. Carotid artery stiffness
      was determined from simultaneously recorded CCA diameter and stroke changes in
      diameter and CCA pressure waveforms, obtained by applanation tonometry. RESULTS: 
      Compared with control subjects, ESRD patients had increased CCA systolic and
      pulse pressures (p < 0.001), larger CCA diameter (p < 0.001) and CCA intima-media
      thickness (p < 0.01) and similar CCA relative wall thickness. In ESRD patients
      the arterial remodeling was associated with increased CCA elastic
      modulus/stiffness (p < 0.001). In ESRD patients the association between CCA
      elastic modulus and age was characterized by a steeper slope (p = 0.03), but
      after separation of uremic patients according to the presence of calcifications, 
      the accelerated aging was observed only in calcified subjects. Despite higher CCA
      systolic and pulse pressures, the CCA relative wall thickness was similar to
      controls indicating an inadequate pressure-associated remodeling. Moreover, the
      positive systolic pressure/relative thickness correlation observed in control
      subjects was lost with paradoxical negative correlation in calcified ESRD
      patients (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that, in ESRD patients,
      accelerated arterial aging and inadequate arterial hypertrophy are closely
      associated with the calcifications of arterial walls. Inadequate hypertrophy is
      responsible for high circumferential stress applied on the vessels.

AB  - Cardiovascular calcification is currently viewed as an active disease process
      similar to embryonic bone formation. Cardiovascular calcification mainly affects 
      the aortic valve and arteries and is associated with increased mortality risk.
      Aortic valve and arterial calcification share similar risk factors, including
      age, gender, diabetes, chronic renal disease, and smoking. However, the exact
      cellular and molecular mechanism of cardiovascular calcification is unknown.
      Late-stage cardiovascular calcification can be visualized with conventional
      imaging modalities such as echocardiography and computed tomography. However,
      these modalities are limited in their ability to detect the development of early 
      calcification and the progression of calcification until advanced tissue
      mineralization is apparent. Due to the subsequent late diagnosis of
      cardiovascular calcification, treatment is usually comprised of invasive
      interventions such as surgery. The need to understand the process of
      calcification is therefore warranted and requires new imaging modalities which
      are able to visualize early cardiovascular calcification. This review focuses on 
      the use of new imaging techniques to visualize novel concepts of cardiovascular
      calcification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral vascular disease and major extremity amputation are common
      in patients with established renal failure and are associated with considerable
      morbidity. Several studies have shown high rates of amputation following
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation, but there is minimal literature on 
      the incidence of amputation following renal transplantation. Furthermore, there
      is little evidence regarding the best method of predicting which patients might
      be at risk of developing peripheral vascular complications after transplantation.
      METHODS: We undertook a 5 year follow-up on the cohort of patients who were on
      our renal transplant waiting list 5 years ago (January 2007). At this time, it
      was standard practice within our unit for all patients to have routine pelvic
      x-rays to assess for vascular calcification of the iliac vessels at the time of
      activation onto the transplant waiting list. Any patients with moderate/severe
      calcification on x-ray, which may complicate transplantation, were referred for
      computed tomography angiogram (CTA) of their aorto-iliac vessels. Mortality,
      transplantation outcomes, and amputation rates at 5 years were correlated with
      the severity of calcification on preoperative imaging. RESULTS: One hundred
      eighty-seven patients were on the waiting list for renal transplantation in
      January 2007 (92 men; mean age, 58.3 +/- 6.2 years). Ninety-three patients
      received a transplant during the subsequent 5 years. By January 2012, 82 patients
      had a functioning transplant, 45 remained on the waiting list (5 suspended), 40
      patients had died, and 20 were alive but no longer on the waiting list.
      Seventy-three (39.5%) had moderate or severe calcification on plain x-ray and
      went on to have CTA. Of these patients, 16 (21.9%) had extensive calcification
      affecting all the iliac vessels and were removed from the waiting list as a
      result. Preoperative imaging was useful in determining the side for surgery in a 
      further 18 patients (24.3%). Twenty-two patients developed vascular
      complications. Nineteen (86.4%) had moderate-severe vascular calcification on
      imaging. Four of the patients with vascular complications (18.2%) underwent
      transplantation (2 had below knee amputation (BKA) prior to transplantation; 1
      developed distal ischemia on the same side as the transplantation 2 years
      postoperatively; 1 had bilateral above knee amputation (AKA) approximately 2
      years after transplantation). Eleven (50%) of the patients with vascular
      complications were dead at 5 years of follow-up. Mortality and amputation rates
      were higher in patients with moderate-severe calcification than minimal
      calcification (30.1% vs 16.6%; P = .02 and 10.9% vs 1.8%; P = .003,
      respectively). There was no difference in rates of delayed graft function (DGF), 
      biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), or creatinine at 1 year between patients
      who underwent transplantation with moderate-severe calcification and those
      without, however, intraoperative vascular complications (26.7% vs 3%; P < .001), 
      graft loss (28.1% vs 3.4%; P = .01), and death with a functioning transplant
      (9.7% vs 1.6%; P = .04) rates were higher in patients with extensive
      calcification compared with those without. CONCLUSIONS: Plain x-ray of the pelvis
      is a useful screening tool to identify those patients who may require further
      detailed vascular imaging prior to transplantation. Amputation rates following
      renal transplantation are low and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in isolation 
      should not preclude transplantation. Nevertheless, significant vascular
      calcification is predictive of mortality both with and without transplantation
      and graft loss in patients with a renal transplant.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is proposed as a cardiovascular risk
      marker in non-uremic subjects. However, little is known about its role in
      patients with higher cardiovascular risk profile such as chronic kidney disease. 
      The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between EAT and several
      cardiovascular surrogate markers (coronary artery calcification (CAC), arterial
      stiffness and atherosclerosis) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. METHODS: 
      A total of 191 prevalent hemodialysis patients were enrolled in this
      cross-sectional study. EAT and CAC scores (CACs) were determined by multi-slice
      computerized tomography, arterial stiffness by carotid-femoral pulse wave
      velocity (PWV), and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) by B-mode
      doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: Mean age was 59 +/- 13 years and time on
      hemodialysis 75 +/- 44 months. Twenty percent of the patients had diabetes. Mean 
      EAT volume was 62.6 +/- 26.8 cm(3)/m(2). Mean CA-IMT and PWV values increased
      across the EAT tertiles. EAT was correlated with age, female gender, body mass
      index, albumin and lipid parameters. Additionally, CA-IMT and PWV values were
      positively correlated with EAT. EAT volume was significantly higher in patients
      with CACs >10 compared to the patients with CACs </=10. Despite the univariate
      associations between EAT and cardiovascular surrogate markers, only age, body
      mass index and total cholesterol levels were associated with EAT in adjusted
      models. CONCLUSIONS: In prevalent hemodialysis patients, EAT is correlated with
      atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and the presence of CAC. However, this
      correlation is not independent of other risk factors.

TI  - Progression of aortic arch calcification over 1 year is an independent predictor 
      of mortality in incident peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - e48793
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0048793 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: The presence and progression of vascular calcification have
      been demonstrated as important risk factors for mortality in dialysis patients.
      However, since the majority of subjects included in most previous studies were
      hemodialysis patients, limited information was available in peritoneal dialysis
      (PD) patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence
      of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and prognostic value of AoAC progression in
      PD patients. METHODS: We prospectively determined AoAC by chest X-ray at PD start
      and after 12 months, and evaluated the impact of AoAC progression on mortality in
      415 incident PD patients. RESULTS: Of 415 patients, 169 patients (40.7%) had AoAC
      at baseline with a mean of 18.1+/-11.2%. The presence of baseline AoAC was an
      independent predictor of all-cause [Hazard ratio (HR): 2.181, 95% confidence
      interval (CI): 1.336-3.561, P = 0.002] and cardiovascular mortality (HR: 3.582,
      95% CI: 1.577-8.132, P = 0.002). Among 363 patients with follow-up chest X-rays
      at 12 months after PD start, the proportion of patients with AoAC progression was
      significantly higher in patients with baseline AoAC (64.2 vs. 5.3%, P<0.001).
      Moreover, all-cause and cardiovascular death rates were significantly higher in
      the progression groups than in the non-progression group (P<0.001). Multivariate 
      Cox analysis revealed that AoAC progression was an independent predictor for
      all-cause (HR: 2.625, 95% CI: 1.150-5.991, P = 0.022) and cardiovascular
      mortality (HR: 4.008, 95% CI: 1.079-14.890, P = 0.038) in patients with AoAC at
      baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest
      X-ray were independently associated with unfavorable outcomes in incident PD
      patients. Regular follow-up by chest X-ray could be a simple and useful method to
      stratify mortality risk in these patients.

TI  - Effect of cinacalcet on cardiovascular disease in patients undergoing dialysis.
PG  - 2482-94
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1205624 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disorders of mineral metabolism, including secondary
      hyperparathyroidism, are thought to contribute to extraskeletal (including
      vascular) calcification among patients with chronic kidney disease. It has been
      hypothesized that treatment with the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet might reduce
      the risk of death or nonfatal cardiovascular events in such patients. METHODS: In
      this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 3883 patients with moderate-to-severe
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (median level of intact parathyroid hormone, 693 pg
      per milliliter [10th to 90th percentile, 363 to 1694]) who were undergoing
      hemodialysis to receive either cinacalcet or placebo. All patients were eligible 
      to receive conventional therapy, including phosphate binders, vitamin D sterols, 
      or both. The patients were followed for up to 64 months. The primary composite
      end point was the time until death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for
      unstable angina, heart failure, or a peripheral vascular event. The primary
      analysis was performed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS:
      The median duration of study-drug exposure was 21.2 months in the cinacalcet
      group, versus 17.5 months in the placebo group. The primary composite end point
      was reached in 938 of 1948 patients (48.2%) in the cinacalcet group and 952 of
      1935 patients (49.2%) in the placebo group (relative hazard in the cinacalcet
      group vs. the placebo group, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 1.02;
      P=0.11). Hypocalcemia and gastrointestinal adverse events were significantly more
      frequent in patients receiving cinacalcet. CONCLUSIONS: In an unadjusted
      intention-to-treat analysis, cinacalcet did not significantly reduce the risk of 
      death or major cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe
      secondary hyperparathyroidism who were undergoing dialysis. (Funded by Amgen;

AB  - Vitamin K is essential for activation of gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla)-proteins
      including the vascular calcification inhibitor matrix Gla-protein (MGP).
      Insufficient vitamin K intake leads to production of uncarboxylated, mostly
      inactive proteins and contributes to an increased cardiovascular risk. In kidney 
      transplant recipients, cardiovascular risk is high but vitamin K intake and
      status have not been defined. We investigated dietary vitamin K intake, vascular 
      vitamin K status and its determinants in kidney transplant recipients. We
      estimated vitamin K intake in a cohort of kidney transplant recipients (n = 60)
      with stable renal function (creatinine clearance 61 [42-77] (median
      [interquartile range]) ml/min), who were 75 [35-188] months after
      transplantation, using three-day food records and food frequency questionnaires. 
      Vascular vitamin K status was assessed by measuring plasma
      desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP). Total vitamin K intake was below the
      recommended level in 50% of patients. Lower vitamin K intake was associated with 
      less consumption of green vegetables (33 vs 40 g/d, p = 0.06) and increased
      dp-ucMGP levels (621 vs 852 pmol/L, p<0.05). Accordingly, dp-ucMGP levels were
      elevated (>500 pmol/L) in 80% of patients. Multivariate regression identified
      creatinine clearance, coumarin use, body mass index, high sensitivity-CRP and
      sodium excretion as independent determinants of dp-ucMGP levels. In a
      considerable part of the kidney transplant population, vitamin K intake is too
      low for maximal carboxylation of vascular MGP. The high dp-ucMGP levels may
      result in an increased risk for arterial calcification. Whether increasing
      vitamin K intake may have health benefits for kidney transplant recipients should
      be addressed by future studies.

TI  - Association between AST-120 and abdominal aortic calcification in predialysis
      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 365-71
LID - 10.1007/s10157-012-0717-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is associated with mortality and
      cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. AST-120, which
      adsorbs uremic toxins, is reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease
      and death in chronic kidney disease patients. The aim of the current study was to
      investigate the association between abdominal aortic calcification and the use of
      AST-120 in predialysis chronic kidney disease patients. METHODS: A retrospective 
      analysis was conducted including 199 predialysis chronic kidney disease patients 
      (stages 4 and 5) who underwent abdominal plain computed tomography in our
      institution between 2005 and 2010. Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed by
      aortic calcification index (ACI). Patients were divided into two groups based on 
      whether or not AST-120 was administered for at least six months, and ACI was
      compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The aortic calcification index was
      significantly lower in patients taking AST-120 [12.2 (2.5-30.3) vs. 25.7
      (13.4-45.3) %, P < 0.001]. According to multivariate linear regression analysis, 
      the use of AST-120 was independently and significantly correlated with ACI after 
      adjusting for confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: The use of AST-120 was
      independently associated with less aortic calcification in predialysis chronic
      kidney disease patients.

      mice.
PG  - 379-86
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9655-9 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification, prevalent in diabetes and chronic kidney disease,
      contributes to morbidity and mortality. To investigate the effect of receptor
      activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) on vascular calcification in vivo, transgenic
      mice, where RANKL expression was targeted to vascular smooth muscle cells using
      the SM22alpha promoter (SM22alpha-Rankl ( tg )), were created. Sixteen-month-old 
      male SM22alpha-Rankl ( tg ) mice had higher body weight and higher serum calcium 
      levels but lower lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) compared with age- and
      gender-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. BMD of long bones, body fat (percent
      of weight) of the leg, and serum levels of phosphate and RANKL were not
      significantly different. No significant differences in these parameters were
      observed in female mice. Histological analysis did not reveal calcium deposits in
      the aortic roots of SM22alpha-Rankl ( tg ) mice. To analyze the osteoblastic
      differentiation and mineralization potentials of vascular cells, aortic smooth
      muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated and cultured. Results showed that
      SM22alpha-Rankl ( tg ) SMCs had higher baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
      activity but not baseline matrix calcification. When induced by the PKA agonist
      forskolin, ALP activity was greater in SM22alpha-Rankl ( tg ) than in WT SMCs.
      Real-time RT-qPCR revealed higher baseline expression of ALP and ankylosis genes 
      but lower osteoprotegerin gene in SM22alpha-Rankl ( tg ) SMCs. Matrix
      mineralization induced by inorganic phosphate or forskolin was greater in
      SM22alpha-Rankl ( tg ) than in WT SMCs. Treatment of these cells with the ALP
      inhibitor levamisole abolished forskolin-induced matrix mineralization but not
      inorganic phosphate-induced matrix mineralization. These findings suggest that
      RANKL overexpression in the vasculature may promote mineralization potential.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD). We examined the cross-sectional association between novel
      risk factors and coronary artery calcium (CAC) measured using electron beam
      computed tomography or multidetector computed tomography among 2,018 patients
      with CKD. Using the total Agatston scores, the participants were classified as
      having no (0), moderate (>0-100), or high (>100) CAC. After adjustment for age,
      gender, race, study sites, cigarette smoking, previous cardiovascular disease,
      hypertension, and diabetes, the use of lipid-lowering drugs, body mass index,
      waist circumference, and cystatin C, several novel risk factors were
      significantly associated with high CAC. For example, the odds ratios of high CAC 
      associated with 1 SD greater level of risk factors were 1.20 (95% confidence
      interval 1.04 to 1.38) for serum calcium, 1.21 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to
      1.41) for serum phosphate, 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.97) for log
      (total parathyroid hormone), 1.21 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.43) for log 
      (homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance), and 1.23 (95% confidence
      interval 1.04 to 1.45) for hemoglobin A1c. Additionally, the
      multivariate-adjusted odds ratio for 1 SD greater level of cystatin C was 1.31
      (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.50). Serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein, 
      interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and homocysteine were not
      statistically significantly associated with high CAC. In conclusion, these data
      indicate that abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism, insulin resistance, and 
      declining kidney function are associated with the prevalence of high CAC,
      independent of the traditional risk factors in patients with CKD. Additional
      studies are warranted to examine the causal effect of these risk factors on CAC
      in patients with CKD.

AB  - Long-term hemodialysis patients are prone to an exceptionally high burden of
      cardiovascular disease and mortality. The novel temperature-based technology of
      digital thermal monitoring (DTM) of vascular reactivity appears associated with
      the severity of coronary artery disease in asymptomatic population. We
      hypothesized that in hemodialysis patients, the DTM and coronary artery calcium
      (CAC) score have a gradient association that follows that of subjects without
      kidney disease. We examined the cross-sectional DTM-CAC associations in a group
      of long-term hemodialysis patients, and their 1:1 matched normal counterpart.
      Area under the curve for temperature (TMP-AUC), the surrogate of the DTM index of
      vascular function, was assessed after a 5-minute arm-cuff reactive hyperemia
      test. Coronary calcium score was measured via electron beam computed tomography
      or multidetector computed tomography scan. We studied 105 randomly recruited
      hemodialysis patients (age: 58 +/- 13 years, 47% men) and 105 age- and
      gender-matched controls. In hemodialysis patients vs. controls, TMP-AUC was
      significantly worse (114 +/- 72 vs. 143 +/- 80, P = 0.001) and CAC score was
      higher (525 +/- 425 vs. 240 +/- 332, P < 0.001). Hemodialysis patients were 14
      times more likely to have CAC score >1000 as compared with controls. After
      adjustment for known confounders, the relative risk for case vs. control for each
      standard deviation decrease in TMP-AUC was 1.46 (95% confidence interval:
      1.12-1.93, P = 0.007). Vascular reactivity measured via the novel DTM technology 
      is incrementally worse across CAC scores in hemodialysis patients, in whom both
      measures are even worse than their age- and gender-matched controls. The DTM
      technology may offer a convenient and radiation-free approach to risk-stratify
      hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Arterial micro-calcification of vascular access is associated with aortic arch
      calcification and arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 216-22

AB  - Vascular calcification of the coronary arteries or aorta is an independent risk
      factor for cardiovascular outcome, but clinical significance of arterial
      micro-calcification (AMC) of vascular access is unclear in hemodialysis (HD)
      patients. Sixty-five patients awaiting vascular access operation were enrolled.
      We compared surrogate markers of cardiovascular morbidity such as aortic arch
      calcification (AoAC) by chest radiography, arterial stiffness by brachial-ankle
      pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and endothelial dysfunction by flow-mediated
      dilatation (FMD) between patients with and without AMC of vascular access on von 
      Kossa staining. AMC of vascular access was detected in 36 (55.4%). The
      AMC-positive group had significantly higher incidence of AoAC (63.9% vs. 20.7%, p
      < 0.001) and higher baPWV (26.5 +/- 9.4 m/s vs. 19.8 +/- 6.6 m/s, p = 0.006) than
      the AMC-negative group. There was no significant difference in FMD between the
      two groups (5.4 +/- 2.6% vs. 5.7 +/- 3.5%, p = 0.764). The AMC-positive group had
      higher incidence of diabetes mellitus, higher systolic blood pressure and wider
      pulse pressure than the AMC-negative group. This study suggests that AMC of
      vascular access may be associated with cardiovascular morbidity via AoAC and
      arterial stiffness in HD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening syndrome marked by vascular
      calcification and cutaneous necrosis. The role of radiographic imaging in
      assisting in diagnosis has not been established. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the
      potential role of plain radiographic imaging in the diagnosis of calciphylaxis.
      METHODS: We searched for cases of patients at our tertiary referral center with a
      diagnosis of calciphylaxis between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2010. Two control
      patients receiving dialysis but without calciphylaxis were age- and sex-matched
      to each study patient. Plain radiographs were obtained from the date closest to
      diagnosis in patients with calciphylaxis and from matched controls at
      approximately the same dates. Two radiologists, masked as to cases and controls, 
      read each image together. Size of calcified vessels, pattern and extent of
      calcifications, presence of net-like or other calcifications, and bone
      density/mineralization were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients 
      with calciphylaxis (mean age, 57 years; 21 [72%] women) were identified. Mean age
      at diagnosis was 57 years (range, 36-75 years). Compared with those of controls, 
      plain radiographs of patients with calciphylaxis had more vascular
      calcifications, more small-vessel calcifications, and a netlike pattern of
      calcifications. A netlike pattern of calcifications had considerable strength of 
      association with calciphylaxis (odds ratio, 9.4) and a specificity of nearly 90%.
      These findings were preserved even if only one image was used per patient.
      LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study. CONCLUSION: A netlike pattern of
      calcifications on plain radiographs was more common in patients with
      calciphylaxis and may aid in diagnosis.

AB  - Insufficient control of serum calcium and phosphate levels in patients undergoing
      hemodialysis is associated with increased mortality. As commonly used
      calcium-containing phosphate binders can cause arterial calcification, newly
      developed calcium-free phosphate binders, such as sevelamer hydrochloride (SH)
      and lanthanum carbonate (LC), have received much attention. We assessed the
      efficacy and safety of SH and LC treatment in Japanese patients undergoing
      hemodialysis in a prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) crossover 
      study. Forty-two patients were randomized to receive SH or LC for 13 weeks, with 
      the dosages adjusted every 2 weeks, followed by treatment with the other drug for
      another 13 weeks. The average daily doses of SH and LC were 2971 +/- 1464 mg and 
      945 +/- 449 mg, respectively. The mean dosage ratio of SH to LC was 3.05, which
      was maintained throughout the treatment period. SH and LC were similarly
      effective at controlling serum calcium and phosphate levels in the majority of
      patients (78-93%). A few serious adverse events (AEs) involving the biliary
      system occurred during the LC treatment period, but they were not considered to
      be treatment-induced. Although the incidence of constipation, the most common
      treatment-related AE, was higher during the SH period (27% vs. 5%; P < 0.05), no 
      difference was observed in total treatment-related AEs. This study demonstrates
      that SH and LC are comparable treatments for controlling serum phosphate and
      calcium levels, and that both compounds are safe and well-tolerated in Japanese
      patients undergoing hemodialysis.

LID - 10.3747/pdi.2011.00165 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracic peri-aortic fat tissue (PFT) and epicardial adipose tissue
      (EAT) are metabolically active visceral fat deposits surrounding the thoracic
      aorta and the heart, respectively. Various studies have demonstrated a positive
      predictive value of both PFT and EAT for coronary artery disease in the general
      population. In the present study, we aimed to investigate PFT thickness and the
      independent predictors of PFT in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. METHODS: Our 
      cross-sectional study enrolled 35 PD patients (10 women, 25 men) and 30
      age-and-sex-matched healthy subjects (15 women, 15 men). We measured PFT,
      thoracic artery calcification (TAC), EAT, and coronary artery calcification (CAC)
      by electrocardiogram-gated 64-multi-detector computed tomography. RESULTS: The
      measured PFT, EAT, CAC, and TAC were significantly higher in the PD group than in
      the healthy subjects (p < 0.05 each). In the PD group, PFT and TAC were
      significantly correlated (r = 0.33, p = 0.007). Also, PFT measurements were
      positively correlated with EAT and total CAC in the PD and the control group
      alike (r = 0.58, p = 0.001 and r = 0.54, p = 0.01 respectively). A stepwise
      linear regression analysis revealed that age, duration of hypertension, and being
      a PD patient were independent predictors of PFT. CONCLUSIONS: Measured PFT was
      higher in PD patients than in healthy subjects and, in the PD population, was
      also shown to be related to calcification scores and EAT.

TI  - Aortic calcification and femoral bone density are independently associated with
      left ventricular mass in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - e39241
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0039241 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and reduced bone density are prevalent in
      chronic kidney disease and linked to increased cardiovascular risk. The mechanism
      is unknown. We assessed the relationship between vascular calcification, femoral 
      bone density and left ventricular mass in patients with stage 3 non-diabetic
      chronic kidney disease in a cross-sectional observational study. METHODOLOGY AND 
      PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 120 patients were recruited (54% male, mean age 55
      +/- 14 years, mean glomerular filtration rate 50 +/- 13 ml/min/1.73 m(2)).
      Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed using lateral lumbar spine
      radiography and was present in 48%. Mean femoral Z-score measured using dual
      energy x-ray absorptiometry was 0.60 +/- 1.06. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance 
      imaging was used to determine left ventricular mass. One patient had left
      ventricular hypertrophy. Subjects with aortic calcification had higher left
      ventricular mass compared to those without (56 +/- 16 vs. 48 +/- 12 g/m(2), P =
      0.002), as did patients with femoral Z-scores below zero (56 +/- 15 vs. 49 +/- 13
      g/m(2), P = 0.01). In univariate analysis presence of aortic calcification
      correlated with left ventricular mass (r = 0.32, P = 0.001); mean femoral Z-score
      inversely correlated with left ventricular mass (r = -0.28, P = 0.004). In a
      multivariate regression model that included presence of aortic calcification,
      mean femoral Z-score, gender and 24-hour systolic blood pressure, 46% of the
      variability in left ventricular mass was explained (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In
      patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, lower mean femoral
      Z-score and presence of aortic calcification are independently associated with
      increased left ventricular mass. Further research exploring the pathophysiology
      that underlies these relationships is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Serum malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein
      (MDA-LDL) and MDA-LDL/LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) ratio are risk factors for
      arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, no information is
      available on these parameters or their associations with coronary artery
      calcification (CAC) in haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Fifty-seven HD patients and 26 control subjects were included in this
      cross-sectional study. Serum MDA-LDL concentrations and MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratios were
      examined. HD patients had significantly higher MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratios than the
      controls (105.1 +/- 27.5 vs. 81.4 +/- 18.9 mU/mg, P < 0.001); however, there was 
      no significant difference in serum MDA-LDL levels between the 2 groups. CAC
      scores were examined only in HD patients and their possible associations with the
      clinical/laboratory data were analysed. Analysis of HD patients showed that
      MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio has an association with presence of CVD, CAC score, HD
      duration, MDA-LDL, or haemoglobin A1C. In addition, the CAC score was positively 
      correlated with serum MDA-LDL level (P = 0.048) and MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio (P =
      0.006). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that
      MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio (beta = 0.04, P = 0.003) and HD duration (beta = 0.16, P =
      0.007) were independently associated with CAC score. CONCLUSION: The
      MDA-LDL/LDL-c ratio of HD patients was significantly higher than that of non-HD
      subjects and was independently associated with the CAC score. Therefore, this
      ratio could be an important risk factor for CAC in HD patients.

PG  - 1557-64
LID - 10.1007/s00467-012-2173-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uremic vasculopathy, including vascular calcification, increases the 
      risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      patients. We have investigated the prevalence and factors associated with
      vasculopathy in children undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD)
      in a single center. METHODS: Common carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and its
      relation with demographics, biochemical parameters and medication was analyzed in
      60 patients (mean age 12.9 +/- 3.4 years; 27 girls) treated with PD (n = 31) or
      HD (n = 29) for 34 +/- 34 months. Patients were divided into two groups: normal
      cIMT and increased cIMT. RESULTS: Mean levels of calcium, phosphate and
      calcium/phosphate product were in the normal range, the but parathyroid hormone
      level, 729 +/- 670 pg/mL, was higher than the National Kidney Foundation Kidney
      Disease Outcome Quality Iniative (K/DOQI) recommendations. Twenty-nine patients
      had increased cIMT, which was associated with time on dialysis of >2 years,
      hypercalcemia, higher daily dose of calcitriol and HD (vs. PD). In the
      multivariate analysis, accounting for time on dialysis, HD persisted as a risk
      for increased cIMT. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of increased cIMT in children on 
      dialysis is similar to that reported in adults with CKD and increased with time
      on dialysis. HD was associated with increased cIMT, independently of time on
      dialysis; however, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the
      possible impact of confounding factors. These results underline the need to
      monitor and, if possible, prevent and treat increased cIMT in children on
      dialysis.

LID - 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.04.011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate of Fetuin-A and
      Pentraxin3 (PTX3) as the main factors for vascular calcification and inflammation
      in hemodialysis (HD) and renal transplant (RT) patients. METHOD: Serum was
      obtained from 45 stable chronic HD patients and 44 stable RT recipients.
      Biochemical factors, intact Parathormone, high-sensitive C-reactive protein
      (hsCRP), Fetuin-A and PTX3 levels were determined by standard methods. RESULTS:
      In the RT recipients PTX3 level was significantly higher than the HD patients
      [5.78(1.09-20.36) ng/mL vs. 1.65(0.24-7.89) ng/mL, p </= 0.001]. Serum Fetuin-A
      concentration was significantly higher in the HD compared to RT group
      [43.39(27.75-81.48) ng/mL vs. 38.76(22.26-89.07) ng/mL, p=0.020]. hsCRP level was
      also higher in the HD than the RT group [2.90(0.1-8.50) mg/L vs. 1.1(0.1-7.9)
      mg/L, p=0.003]. CONCLUSION: Although our study shows that serum PTX3 is increased
      and Fetuin-A is decreased after successful RT, their direct role on

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether body mass index (BMI) and coronary artery
      calcification (CAC) are risk factors for kidney function decline in predialysis
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of 125
      stage 3 to 5 predialysis CKD patients. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: CKD patients
      receiving care in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. METHODS: BMI, CAC, and kidney
      function were measured at baseline. CAC was measured by multislice computed
      tomography scan. Kidney function was determined by the 4-variable reexpressed
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. At study end, kidney
      function decline among patients was compared according to baseline BMI and CAC.
      MAIN OUTCOME: Kidney function decline was defined as a 1-year decline in
      estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >/= 5%. RESULTS: Individuals with 
      a decline in eGFR of >/= 5% at 1 year had higher baseline BMI (33.5 +/- 8.3 vs.
      28.4 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2); P = .0001) and higher baseline median CAC scores (239 vs.
      25 Agatston units; P = .01) compared with subjects without such a decline. BMI (r
      = 0.35; P < .0001) and logarithmically transformed CAC score (r = 0.22; P = .01) 
      correlated with an eGFR decline of >/= 5%. Both crude and adjusted logistic
      regression analyses showed escalating CAC (with CAC reported in quintiles and CAC
      score = 0 Agatston unit as the reference group) was associated with an increased 
      risk of eGFR decline of >/= 5%. CONCLUSIONS: CAC and BMI were associated with
      kidney function decline over 1 year. The risk of kidney function decline was
      greater in those with increasing burden of CAC, which remained robust in the
      adjusted analysis accounting for the risk factors for CKD progression. Larger
      studies will be required for independent validation of the associations of BMI,
      CAC, and kidney function decline, and to investigate whether obesity and CAC
      treatment strategies are efficacious in attenuating kidney function decline in
      predialysis CKD patients.

TI  - Aortic stiffness and calcification in men in a population-based international
      study.
PG  - 473-7
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2012.03.027 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Aortic stiffness, a hallmark of vascular aging, is an independent
      risk factor of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. The association of
      aortic stiffness with aortic calcification in middle-aged general population
      remains unknown although studies in patients with end-stage renal disease or
      elderly subjects suggest that aortic calcification is an important determinant of
      aortic stiffness. The goal of this study was to examine the association of aortic
      calcification and stiffness in multi-ethnic population-based samples of
      relatively young men. METHODS: We examined the association in 906 men aged 40-49 
      (81 Black Americans, 276 Japanese Americans, 258 White Americans and 291
      Koreans). Aortic stiffness was measured as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity
      (cfPWV) using an automated waveform analyzer. Aortic calcification from aortic
      arch to iliac bifurcation was evaluated using electron-beam computed tomography. 
      RESULTS: Aortic calcium score was calculated and was categorized into four
      groups: zero (n=303), 1-100 (n=411), 101-300 (n=110), and 401+ (n=82). Aortic
      calcification category had a significant positive association with cfPWV after
      adjusting for age, race, and mean arterial pressure (mean (standard error) of
      cfPWV (cm/s) from the lowest to highest categories: 836 (10), 850 (9), 877 (17)
      and 941 (19), P for trend <0.001). The significant positive association remained 
      after further adjusting for other cardiovascular risk factors. The significant
      positive association was also observed in each race group. CONCLUSIONS: The
      results suggest that aortic calcification can be one mechanism for aortic
      stiffness and that the association of aortic calcification with stiffness starts 
      as early as the 40s.

TI  - Circulating sclerostin and Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) in predialysis chronic kidney
      disease (CKD): relationship with bone density and arterial stiffness.
PG  - 473-80
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9595-4 [doi]
AB  - Abnormalities of bone metabolism and increased vascular calcification are common 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and important causes of morbidity and mortality. 
      The Wnt signaling pathway may play a role in the bone and vascular disturbances
      seen in CKD, termed collectively "CKD-MBD." The aim of the study was to
      investigate the possible association of circulating concentrations of the
      secreted Wnt signaling inhibitors DKK1 and sclerostin with BMD and arterial
      stiffness in predialysis CKD. Seventy-seven patients (48 M, 29 F), mean age 57
      (SD = 14) years with CKD stages 3B (n = 32) and 4 (n = 45) were studied.
      Sclerostin, DKK1, PTH, and 1,25(OH)(2)D were analyzed. BMD was measured at the
      lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH), and forearm (FARM).
      Arterial stiffness index was determined by contour analysis of digital volume
      pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a positive correlation between sclerostin and age (r =
      0.47, p < 0.000). Sclerostin was higher in men than women (p = 0.013). Following 
      correction for age and gender, there was a negative association between GFR and
      sclerostin (p = 0.002). We observed a positive association between sclerostin and
      BMD at the LS (p = 0.0001), FN (p = 0.004), and TH (p = 0.002). In contrast, DKK1
      was negatively associated with BMD at the FN (p = 0.038). A negative association 
      was seen between DKK1 and SI(DVP) (p = 0.027). Our data suggest that the Wnt
      pathway may play a role in CKD-MBD. Prospective studies are required to establish
      the clinical relevance of sclerostin and DKK1 as serological markers in CKD.

AB  - To analyze predictive factors for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV)
      mortality, nonfatal CV events (CVE) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients,
      and to compare the effects of standard hemodialysis (HD) and online
      hemodiafiltration (HDF) on these factors and outcomes. A total of 333 MHD
      patients were prospectively followed up for 50 +/- 15 months and all-cause death,
      CV death and CVE were registered. At the baseline, demographic, clinical, and
      laboratory data of the whole population were recorded. Then, patients were
      stratified into two groups according to the dialysis modalities, HD (n = 268) and
      HDF (n = 65). At the end of 6th month, clinical and laboratory data were recorded
      again. The predictive factors at baseline for all-cause mortality, CV mortality, 
      and CVE were analyzed by Cox regression. The effects of HD and HDF on these
      factors at the 6th month and long-term outcomes were compared by t-test and
      Kaplan-Meier method, respectively. Age, gender, left ventricular mass index
      (LVMI), aortic arch calcification score (AoACS), hemoglobin (Hb) <10 g/dL, and
      ferritin >500 ng/mL maintained independent associations with all-cause mortality.
      C-reactive protein (CRP), LVMI, AoACS, and Hb <10 g/dL were associated with CV
      mortality. Prior cardiovascular disease (CVD), AoACS and LVMI were independent
      predictors of nonfatal CVE. Higher body mass index (BMI), body weight, total
      serum cholesterol, Hb concentration, and lower CRP level, LVMI, and AoACS were
      found in patients on HDF at the end of the 6th month. Improved outcomes with
      longer survival time for all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and CVE were found in
      HDF group. Age, gender, LVMI, AoACS, Hb, and ferritin were predictors of
      all-cause mortality in MHD patients. CRP, LVMI, AoACS, and Hb were associated
      with CV mortality. Prior CVD, AoACS, and LVMI were independent predictors of
      nonfatal CVE. HDF could improve BMI, body weight, total serum cholesterol, Hb,
      CRP, LVMI, AoACS, and long-term outcomes, including all-cause mortality, CV
      mortality, and CVE.

      kidney disease patients. In contrast, elevated levels of sTWEAK predict poor
      survival in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recent evidence suggests a role for
      sTWEAK in the pathophysiology of vascular calcification. The aim of the study was
      to investigate plausible links between sTWEAK, atherosclerosis, arterial
      stiffness and vascular calcification in HD patients. METHODS: Coronary artery
      calcification score (CACs) determined by multislice computed tomography, arterial
      stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid artery intima-media thickness 
      (CA-IMT) by carotid Doppler ultrasonography were assessed in 131 long-term
      prevalent HD patients. sTWEAK levels were measured by ELISA (Bender MedSystems,
      Vienna, Austria). RESULTS: Mean serum sTWEAK level was 237.0 +/- 147.5 pg/mL
      (range 78-937). sTWEAK level was inversely correlated with CA-IMT at a borderline
      significance (r=-0.168, p=0.05). Neither carotid-radial PWV nor carotid-femoral
      PWV values correlated with sTWEAK. sTWEAK level was higher in patients with
      severe vascular calcification (CACs >/=400) compared to patients with CACs <400
      (264.5 +/- 146.8 pg/mL vs. 205.04 +/- 122.4 pg/mL, p=0.02).The association
      between sTWEAK and vascular calcification persisted after multivariate
      adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: There exists a weak inverse correlation between sTWEAK
      and carotid atherosclerosis and a positive correlation with coronary artery
      calcification in long-term HD patients. Our data give support for a role for
      sTWEAK in the pathogenesis of vascular injury in HD patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Kidney transplantation (KT) is associated with increased incidence of
      hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and posttransplant diabetes
      mellitus that promote the development of coronary artery calcification (CAC). The
      aim of the current study was to elucidate the extent of CAC and its risk factors 
      among KT patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed to evaluate the
      severity of CAC in our KT patients. Multidetector computed tomography was
      performed to assess the coronary artery calcium score (CACS). Patients were
      further stratified according to the CACS as: group 1: 0-10, group 2: 11-100,
      group 3: 101-300, group 4: 301-1000, and group 5: >1000. Clinical as well as
      demographic data were compared among groups. Linear regression analysis was
      performed to determine factors that were associated with CAC. RESULTS: A total of
      99 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 53.5 +/- 11.8 years and 
      duration of follow-up post-KT was 11.2 +/- 5.9 years. The distribution of CACS in
      groups 1 through 5 was: 41.4%, 20.2%, 11.1%, 15.2%, and 12.1%, respectively. A
      significantly higher CACS was found in males, patients with pretransplant
      diabetes mellitus, older current age, older age at KT, hypertension, higher body 
      weight, higher fasting plasma sugar level and lower high-density lipoprotein
      (HDL) cholesterol. Twenty-nine (29.3%) patients fulfilled criteria for metabolic 
      syndrome (MS). The CACS was significantly higher in patients with MS than in
      those without MS. An incremental CACS was found to be correlated with increasing 
      number of MS components (P = .003). Multivariate linear regression revealed that 
      female gender, current age, hypertension, and HDL cholesterol were associated
      with CAC. CONCLUSION: KT was associated with high CACS in a significant
      proportion of patients with long-term follow-up. Several risk factors were
      identified. Some of them were potentially treatable and should be taken into
      consideration in the management of KT recipients.

TI  - Arterial microcalcification in atherosclerotic patients with and without chronic 
      kidney disease: a comparative high-resolution scanning X-ray diffraction
      analysis.
PG  - 465-72
LID - 10.1007/s00223-012-9594-5 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification, albeit heterogeneous in terms of biological and
      physicochemical properties, has been associated with ageing, lifestyle, diabetes,
      and chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is unknown whether or not moderately
      impaired renal function (CKD stages 2-4) affects the physiochemical composition
      and/or the formation of magnesium-containing tricalcium phosphate
      ([Ca,Mg](3)[PO(4)](2), whitlockite) in arterial microcalcification. Therefore, a 
      high-resolution scanning X-ray diffraction analysis (European Synchrotron
      Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France) utilizing histological sections of
      paraffin-embedded arterial specimens derived from atherosclerotic patients with
      normal renal function (n = 15) and CKD (stages 2-4, n = 13) was performed. This
      approach allowed us to spatially assess the contribution of calcium phosphate
      (apatite) and whitlockite to arterial microcalcification. Per group, the number
      of samples (13 vs. 12) with sufficient signal intensity and total lengths of
      regions (201 vs. 232 mum) giving rise to diffractograms ("informative regions")
      were comparable. Summarizing all informative regions per group into one composite
      sample revealed calcium phosphate/apatite as the leading mineral phase in CKD
      patients, whereas in patients with normal renal function the relative
      contribution of whitlockite and calcium phosphate/apatite was on the same order
      of magnitude (CKD, calcium phosphate/apatite 157 mum, whitlockite 38.7 mum;
      non-CKD, calcium phosphate/apatite 79.0 mum, whitlockite 94.1 mum; each p <
      0.05). Our results, although based on a limited number of samples, indicate that 
      chronic impairment of renal function affects local magnesium homeostasis and thus
      contributes to the physicochemical composition of microcalcification in
      atherosclerotic patients.

TI  - Coronary plaque characteristics in patients with mild chronic kidney disease.
      Analysis by 320-row area detector computed tomography.
PG  - 1436-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The differences in the coronary plaque characteristics between
      patients with mild chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration 
      rate [eGFR] 30-59 ml.min(-1) . 1.73 m(-2)) and those without CKD (eGFR >/=60) by 
      320-row area detector computed tomography (CT) have not been studied. METHODS AND
      RESULTS: We enrolled 487 patients undergoing coronary CT angiography with
      suspected stable coronary artery disease (mean age: 66.6+/-10.8 years, 131 with
      mild CKD) and analyzed 6,352 segments. All coronary plaques were characterized
      for the presence of vessel remodeling, plaque consistency and the disposition of 
      coronary calcification, and a plaque with positive vessel remodeling and/or
      low-attenuation was defined as high risk. The number of diseased segments per
      patient was higher in mild CKD patients than in those without CKD (4.61+/-3.83
      vs. 2.95+/-3.11, P<0.0001). The prevalence of severe stenosis (>/=70% luminal
      diameter) was significantly higher in cases of mild CKD than in no CKD (35.1% vs.
      19.4%, P=0.0003), but there was no significant difference in the prevalence of
      high-risk plaque (13.0% vs. 9.8%, P=0.3189). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of
      coronary artery stenosis was higher in the patients with mild CKD, though there
      was no significant difference in the prevalence of high-risk plaque. We suggest
      that the high risk of coronary events in patients with CKD is related to the
      severity of stenosis rather than to the characteristics of plaque.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether newer risk markers for coronary heart disease (CHD) improve
      CHD risk prediction remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether newer risk
      markers for CHD risk prediction and stratification improve Framingham risk score 
      (FRS) predictions. DESIGN: Prospective population-based study. SETTING: The
      Rotterdam Study, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 5933 asymptomatic,
      community-dwelling participants (mean age, 69.1 years [SD, 8.5]). MEASUREMENTS:
      Traditional CHD risk factors used in the FRS (age, sex, systolic blood pressure, 
      treatment of hypertension, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels,
      smoking, and diabetes) and newer CHD risk factors (N-terminal fragment of
      prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide levels, von Willebrand factor antigen
      levels, fibrinogen levels, chronic kidney disease, leukocyte count, C-reactive
      protein levels, homocysteine levels, uric acid levels, coronary artery calcium
      [CAC] scores, carotid intima-media thickness, peripheral arterial disease, and
      pulse wave velocity). RESULTS: Adding CAC scores to the FRS improved the accuracy
      of risk predictions (c-statistic increase, 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.06]; net
      reclassification index, 19.3% overall [39.3% in those at intermediate risk, by
      FRS]). Levels of N-terminal fragment of prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide
      also improved risk predictions but to a lesser extent (c-statistic increase, 0.02
      [CI, 0.01 to 0.04]; net reclassification index, 7.6% overall [33.0% in those at
      intermediate risk, by FRS]). Improvements in predictions with other newer markers
      were marginal. LIMITATION: The findings may not be generalizable to younger or
      nonwhite populations. CONCLUSION: Among 12 CHD risk markers, improvements in FRS 
      predictions were most statistically and clinically significant with the addition 
      of CAC scores. Further investigation is needed to assess whether risk refinements
      using CAC scores lead to a meaningful change in clinical outcome. Whether to use 
      CAC score screening as a more routine test for risk prediction requires full
      consideration of the financial and clinical costs of performing versus not
      performing the test for both persons and health systems. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE:

TI  - Coronary plaque composition, morphology, and outcomes in patients with and
      without chronic kidney disease presenting with acute coronary syndromes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the impact of chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) on coronary atherosclerotic plaque composition, morphology, and outcomes in
      patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). BACKGROUND: CKD patients presenting
      with ACS are at increased risk for adverse events. Whether or not this increased 
      risk reflects differences in coronary plaque composition remains unknown.
      METHODS: In the PROSPECT (Providing Regional Observations to Study Predictors of 
      Events in the Coronary Tree) study, patients presenting with ACS in whom
      percutaneous coronary intervention was successful underwent 3-vessel grayscale
      and radiofrequency intravascular ultrasound imaging. Lesions were prospectively
      characterized, and patients were followed for a median of 3.4 years. We conducted
      a patient-level and lesion-level analysis of study participants by comparing
      intravascular ultrasound parameters of untreated nonculprit lesions in patients
      with and without CKD. RESULTS: Patients with CKD (n = 73, 11.3%) were older, more
      often female and diabetic compared to those without CKD (n = 573). Nonculprit
      lesions in patients with (n = 280) versus without (n = 2,390) CKD were more
      likely to have plaque burden >/= 70% (11.8% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.05) and minimal
      luminal area </= 4.0 mm(2) (25.9% vs. 19.2%, p = 0.005). The percentage of plaque
      comprised of necrotic core (15.0% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.0001) and dense calcium (8.2% 
      vs. 6.4%, p < 0.0001) was higher while fibrous tissue (57.7% vs. 59.8%, p <
      0.0001) was lower in CKD versus non-CKD lesions. The 3-year composite rate of
      cardiac death, cardiac arrest, or myocardial infarction (15.1% vs. 3.3%, p <
      0.0001) was significantly higher in patients with than in those without CKD,
      although there were no differences in the rates of events adjudicated to
      nonculprit lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Following percutaneous coronary intervention of 
      all culprit lesions in ACS, patients with versus without CKD have more extensive 
      and severe atherosclerosis remaining in their coronary tree with plaque composed 
      of greater necrotic core and less fibrous tissue. These influences resulted in
      nonsignificantly different rates of non-culprit lesion-related adverse events,
      although cardiac death, arrest, or myocardial infarction were more common in
      patients with CKD.

TI  - Fetuin-A serum levels are not correlated to kidney function in long-lived
      subjects.
PG  - 637-40
LID - 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.02.024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Serum Fetuin A has been identified as an inhibitor of ectopic
      calcification. It is reduced in subjects with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and it
      has been proposed as a potential link between CKD and the higher prevalence of
      arterial calcification observed in these patients. During aging both the
      stiffening of arterial wall due to calcification and a decline in kidney function
      are frequent. The aim of the study is to investigate if Fetuin A serum levels are
      associated with aging and with AHSG T256S polymorphism. Moreover, we aim at
      investigate whether serum Fetuin A is correlated to kidney function in this
      setting of senescence. DESIGN AND METHODS: 256 health long-lived subjects (age 92
      [81-100]) were recruited for the study. Serum Fetuin A was evaluated by ELISA,
      Cystatin C by immune-nephelometry. AHSG T256S was determinated by PCR-RFLP.
      RESULTS: Serum Fetuin A shows a significant correlation with age (r=0.20;
      P=0.0048). AHSG TS and SS genotypes are associated to lower levels of serum
      protein (0.27 [0.19-0.29] g/L vs 0.42 [0.32-0.49] g/L; P<0.027 and 0.34
      [0.25-0.41] g/L vs 0.42 [0.32-0.49] g/L; P<0.001, respectively). No significant
      correlation between Fetuin A and Cystatin C was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Serum
      Fetuin A increases with age in elder individuals and subjects with the TS or SS
      AHSG polymorphism have lower levels of the circulating protein. No correlation
      with kidney function decline was observed. Other mechanisms should be
      investigated to explain the increase of Fetuin A with age.

TI  - Cardiovascular disease in children with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 578-85
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2011111115 [doi]
AB  - More than a decade ago, cardiovascular disease (CVD) was recognized as a major
      cause of death in children with advanced CKD. This observation has sparked the
      publication of multiple studies assessing cardiovascular risk, mechanisms of
      disease, and early markers of CVD in this population. Similar to adults, children
      with CKD have an extremely high prevalence of traditional and uremia-related CVD 
      risk factors. Early markers of cardiomyopathy, such as left ventricular
      hypertrophy and dysfunction, and early markers of atherosclerosis, such as
      increased carotid artery intima-media thickness, carotid arterial wall stiffness,
      and coronary artery calcification, are frequently present in these children,
      especially those on maintenance dialysis. As a population without preexisting
      symptomatic cardiac disease, children with CKD potentially receive significant
      benefit from aggressive attempts to prevent and treat CVD. Early CKD, before
      needing dialysis, is the optimal time to both identify modifiable risk factors
      and intervene in an effort to avert future CVD. Slowing the progression of CKD,
      avoiding long-term dialysis and, if possible, conducting preemptive
      transplantation may represent the best strategies to decrease the risk of
      premature cardiac disease and death in children with CKD.

TI  - Risk factors associated with coronary artery calcification should be examined
      before kidney transplantation.
PG  - 137-44
AB  - The best treatment for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is kidney
      transplantation, but the renal transplant recipients still have a higher
      incidence of cardiovascular events compared with general population.
      Cardiovascular risk factors were imposed long before ESRD, as the majority of
      patients starting dialysis or kidney transplantation already have signs of
      advanced atherosclerosis. Artery calcification is an organized, regulated process
      similar to bone formation. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is found
      frequently in advanced atherosclerotic lesions and could be a useful marker of
      them. We evaluated the prevalence of CAC in 49 stable renal transplant recipients
      and in 48 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
      stages 2-5 not requiring dialysis to assess risk factors associated with CAC.
      Computed tomography was used for CAC detection and quantification (CAC score).
      The prevalence of CAC was 43.8% in transplant recipients and 16.7% in CKD
      patients (p < 0.001). Transplant recipients with CAC were significantly older and
      had longer duration of CKD and/or dialysis than recipients without CAC. In
      contrast, the serum levels of fetuin A (an inhibitor of vascular calcification)
      and albumin were significantly lower in CKD patients with CAC than those without 
      CAC. During the observation period (30 months), 30 patients, including 23 CKD
      patients, began dialysis, and 4 transplant recipients and 2 CKD patients died.
      Independent predictors of mortality were age, serum amyloid A and the CAC score. 
      In conclusion, the examination and prevention of risk factors associated with
      atherosclerosis should be started at the beginning of renal failure.

TI  - Prevalence of peripheral vascular calcifications in patients on chronic
      hemodialysis at a tertiary care center in Beirut: a pilot study.
PG  - 117-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications are highly prevalent in patients maintained
      on chronic hemodialysis. They have been linked to numerous risk factors and have 
      been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the prevalence of vascular
      calcifications among dialysis patients in our tertiary care center and to
      identify the associated risk factors. METHODS: In the current study, we reviewed 
      the charts of 43 patients undergoing hemodialysis at our center. We estimated the
      prevalence of vascular calcifications among dialysis patients using plain X-ray
      of the hand as the screening tool. We compared patient's characteristics and
      tried to identify possible risk factors, with a special emphasis on the subgroup 
      of patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Vascular calcifications were prevalent among 
      half of the patients on hemodialysis. Duration of dialysis (p = 0.02), diabetes
      (p < 0.001), and hypertension (p = 0.01) were highly associated with vascular
      calcifications. No association was found between vascular calcifications and age,
      gender, calcium-based phosphate binders, vitamin D supplementation, smoking, and 
      lipid control. In multivariate analyses, diabetes and duration of dialysis were
      the only independent predictors of vascular calcifications and diabetics
      developed vascular calcifications earlier than nondiabetics (31 months vs 69
      months). CONCLUSION: Vascular calcifications are moderately prevalent among
      patients undergoing hemodialysis at our center, and were found to be strongly
      correlated with diabetes and duration of dialysis. A larger, multicenter,
      prospective study should be conducted at national level, in order to confirm the 
      findings of this study and to identify further modifiable risk factors, to
      decrease the incidence of vascular calcifications and the incurring
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in our population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both fetuin-A and hyperparathyroidism play crucial roles in vascular 
      calcification (VC) and bone metabolism. However, the correlation between
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), parathyroidectomy (PTX) and fetuin-A levels
      in dialysis patients has not yet been studied. METHODS: For this study, we
      included 27 consecutive dialysis patients with severe SHPT who underwent total
      PTX with autotransplantation over a period of 2 years (from Oct 2006 to Sep
      2008). Serum ionized calcium (iCa), phosphorus (Pi), bone-specific alkaline
      phosphatase (bAP), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and fetuin-A were checked
      basally and 2, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days after PTX. RESULTS: Two days after PTX, the
      iPTH, serum iCa, and Pi concentrations significantly decreased. Serum bAP levels 
      gradually increased after PTX, peaked after 14 days (p < 0.05), and then
      gradually decreased. Serum fetuin-A levels significantly increased during the
      first 7 days after PTX, peaked 14 days after PTX (0.21 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.07
      mg/ml, p < 0.05), and then remained at a stable level 60 days after PTX. There
      were significant correlations between percentage increase in serum fetuin-A
      levels and percentage decrease in serum iPTH levels 2 days and 7 days after PTX
      (r = 0.526, p < 0.01; r = 0.403, p < 0.05, respectively) and correlations between
      percentage increase in serum fetuin-A levels and percentage decrease in serum iCa
      levels 30 and 60 days after PTX (r = 0.449, p < 0.05; r = 0.474, p < 0.05,
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Serum fetuin-A significantly increased after PTX in
      uremic patients with SHPT. The percentage increase in serum fetuin-A after PTX
      was closely correlated with the percentage decrease in serum iPTH levels
      immediately after PTX, and with the percentage decrease in serum iCa levels in
      the later stage after PTX. Further investigations are necessary to further
      understand the regulation of fetuin-A in dialysis patients with sSHPT.

      with CKD: a retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 636-44
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.11.037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated vascular calcification contributes to cardiovascular
      disease burden in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We hypothesized
      that bisphosphonate therapy would reduce the risk of mortality and cardiovascular
      events in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING &
      PARTICIPANTS: Adult women with stage 3 or 4 CKD receiving primary care in a large
      rural integrated health care system in 2004-2010. EXPOSURE: Time-dependent
      exposure status based on outpatient prescription for any medication within the
      bisphosphonate class, obtained from electronic health records. OUTCOMES: Time to 
      death and first cardiovascular event (composite of myocardial infarction, heart
      failure, or stroke). RESULTS: Data from 9,604 eligible female patients with CKD
      were analyzed; 3,234 were treated with bisphosphonate therapy. During a median
      follow-up of 3.9 (25th-75th percentile, 2.3-5.4) years, there were 286 versus 881
      deaths and 206 versus 571 cardiovascular events (treated vs not-treated groups,
      respectively). In a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, the adjusted HR
      for death (treated vs not treated) was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67-0.91; P = 0.003). In
      Cox modeling adjusted for similar baseline covariates, treatment with
      bisphosphonates was not associated with a lower risk of the composite
      cardiovascular outcome (adjusted HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.94-1.39; P = 0.2).
      LIMITATIONS: Residual confounding by unidentified factors, exclusion of male
      patients, and lack of information about longitudinal drug adherence. CONCLUSIONS:
      For female patients with CKD, treatment with bisphosphonates is associated with a
      lower risk of death, but not cardiovascular events. Confirmatory studies and
      investigations of potential causal mechanisms are warranted.

      peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.
PG  - 33-9
LID - AOP62 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dialysis patients presents increased arterial stiffness. Results of
      available studies comparing arterial stiffness in peritoneal dialysis (PD)
      patients vs hemodialysis (HD) patients are inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: The aim of
      the study was to compare pulse wave velocity (PWV) in PD and HD patients and to
      compare value of measured PWV (PWV(M)) with theoretical value of this parameter
      (PWV(T)) calculated using formula developed by Blacher et al. From the equation
      it is apparent that PWV increases by 0.8 m/s for each decade of life. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: Carotid-femoral PWV(M) was measured in 35 PD and 26 HD patients,
      using Complior device. In all patients PWV(T) was also calculated. RESULTS: The
      study groups did not differ significantly with respect to age, gender, and
      prevalence of diabetes. The value of PWV(M) (PD:12.1 +/- 3.3 vs HD:12.0 +/- 3.0
      m/s) and PWV(T) (PD:10.0 +/- 1.4 vs HD:9.9 +/- 1.2 m/s) did not differ
      significantly between PD and HD. PWV(M) was significantly higher than PWVT in
      both, PD and HD patients. Diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure was
      higher in PD patients, but systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure did not
      differ significantly. In PD patients a higher number of antihypertensive
      medications was used (3 +/- 1 vs 2 +/- 1;p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness
      is equally high in peritoneal dialysis patients and in hemodialysis patients.
      Measured value of PWV in both, PD and HD patients, is significantly higher when
      compared with theoretical value of PWV. This finding may reflect accelerated
      arterial aging in patients on dialysis.

PG  - 139-42
LID - 10.1053/j.jrn.2011.10.024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Coronary artery calcification has been associated with higher
      mortality in coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease. This study aimed
      to correlate coronary artery calcification score (CACS) with all-cause and
      cardiovascular mortalities in hemodialysis (HD) patients. DESIGN, SETTING,
      SUBJECTS: A survival analysis was conducted in 200 HD patients. CACS was assessed
      by multidetector-row computed tomography and stratified as tertiles: group 1 (0
      approximately 105 U), group 2 (110 approximately 1067 U), and group 3 (1094
      approximately 15481 U). The duration of follow-up was 7 years and 4 months.
      Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD 
      duration were performed to examine the impact of CACS on survival. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURE: All-cause and cardiovascular mortalities were measured. RESULTS: The
      cumulative all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were significantly
      lower than those of groups 2 and 3 (all-cause mortality: 7.6% vs. 43.3% and
      52.2%, respectively, cardiovascular mortality: 3.0% vs. 22.4% and 26.9%,
      respectively). Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted for age and HD duration 
      revealed that all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities of group 1 were
      significantly lower than those of groups 2 and 3. CONCLUSION: CACS is helpful to 
      predict prognosis of HD patients independently of age and HD duration.

PG  - 114-9
LID - 10.1053/j.jrn.2011.10.025 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a longevity gene, protects cells against oxidative
      and genotoxic stress. This study aimed to investigate the association of SIRT 1
      gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms, namely, rs7895833, rs7069102, and rs2273773
      with lipid profiles and coronary artery calcification score in 219 Japanese
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: Genotyping of these polymorphisms was
      performed using polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers
      assay. RESULTS: The A allele frequency of rs7895833 and G allele frequency of
      rs7069102 were significantly lower in HD patients (0.228 and 0.131, respectively)
      than those in 803 control subjects (general population) (0.289 and 0.181,
      respectively) (P = .010 and P = .012, respectively). However, the allele
      frequency of rs2273773 was not significantly different from that in the control
      subjects. Multivariate analysis adjusted for age and duration on HD demonstrated 
      that the serum levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were
      significantly high in G allele carriers of rs7069102 compared with CC genotype in
      male HD patients. Coronary artery calcification score was significantly high in C
      allele carriers of rs2273773 in all and male HD patients. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT 1
      polymorphisms, rs7069102 and rs2273773, are associated with abnormal cholesterol 
      metabolism and coronary artery calcification, respectively, in Japanese HD
      patients, especially in males.

      in vitamin D levels.
PG  - 563-8
LID - 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.11.028 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin
      D deficiency in hemodialysis (HD) patients and the relationship between seasonal 
      variations in vitamin D levels and vascular calcification. METHODS: As a
      prospective observational study, we analyzed 289 HD patients. We have assessed
      serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels at the end of the summer (September) and
      winter (March) and analyzed the data to reveal the association of serum 25D level
      with vascular calcification scores (VCS) at the end of the summer, when vitamin D
      levels were found to peak. Plan X-ray images of lateral lumbar spine from all
      subjects were studied for calculation of semiquantitative VCS as described by
      Kauppila. RESULTS: The prevalence of 25D deficiency was 86.2% at the end of the
      summer and increased to 96.2% at the end of the winter. Female gender and
      diabetes were associated with vitamin D deficiency. According to univariate
      analysis, 25D levels were inversely related to vascular calcification. However,
      after correcting for confounding factors, this relationship lost statistical
      significance. Multivariate analysis showed that age, systolic blood pressure, and
      LDL-cholesterol levels were directly associated with a higher VCS. CONCLUSION:
      Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in HD patients with marked seasonal
      variation. However, low 25D levels could not be identified as an independent
      predictor of vascular calcification in these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Sudden death is the major cause of cardiac mortality in dialysis
      patients, accounting for approximately 60% of cardiovascular deaths. A prolonged 
      QT interval and arterial calcification have been associated with increased
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in different patient populations including
      patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the present study, we aimed to
      elucidate the association of vascular calcification with corrected QT interval
      duration in patients with end-stage renal disease. METHODS: We performed a
      single-center cross-sectional study in patients referred for renal
      transplantation. Patients taking QT-prolonging agents or with conduction
      abnormalities were excluded. Aortic calcifications were scored by means of lumbar
      X-rays. RESULTS: In the final analysis, 193 patients (118 men, 52 years old) were
      included. A prolonged QT interval was observed in 26% of the patients.
      Multivariate analysis showed an independent and direct association between
      corrected QT duration and the extent of aortic calcifications (p = 0.0004)
      independent of age, gender, cardiovascular history, electrolytes and parameters
      of mineral metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: A prolonged QT interval is prevalent in
      patients with CKD stage 5D. Aortic calcification is associated with a prolonged
      QT duration, independent of traditional determinants.

TI  - Association of serum calcitonin with coronary artery disease in individuals with 
      and without chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1169-75
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0076-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent data implicate disordered bone and mineral
      metabolism, including changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid 
      hormone (PTH), vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), and fetuin A, as 
      novel risk factors for arterial calcification. The potential role of calcitonin, 
      another hormonal regulator of mineral and bone metabolism, has not been studied
      in detail. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the link between serum
      calcitonin and the total burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) using the
      validated Gensini score, in a cross-sectional study of 88 patients with estimated
      GFR (eGFR) between 46 and 87 ml/min/1.73 m(2) who underwent coronary angiography.
      We evaluated the associations between serum calcitonin, minerals (calcium,
      phosphate), calcium x phosphate product, and other factors that regulate mineral 
      metabolism (intact PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D, FGF-23, and fetuin A) and the severity
      of CAD. RESULTS: The mean serum calcitonin was 11.5 +/- 7.8 pg/ml. In univariate 
      analysis, the Gensini CAD severity score correlated significantly with male
      gender, eGFR, and serum levels of 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF-23, fetuin A, and
      calcitonin (R = 0.474, P = 0.001 for the latter). In multivariate analysis
      adjusted for calcium, phosphate, 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF 23, fetuin A, and
      calcitonin, only calcitonin (beta = 0.20; P = 0.03), FGF-23, fetuin A, and
      25-OH-vitamin D emerged as independent predictors of Gensini score. In the second
      step, we adjusted for the presence of traditional risk factors, proteinuria, and 
      GFR. After these adjustments, the FGF-23 and fetuin A remained statistically
      significant predictors of the Gensini score, while calcitonin did not.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that, in addition to other well-known components 
      of mineral metabolism, increased calcitonin levels are associated with greater
      severity of CAD. However, this relation was not independent of traditional and
      nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. Longitudinal studies in larger
      populations including patients with more advanced CKD are needed.

TI  - A case-control study of calciphylaxis in Japanese end-stage renal disease
      patients.
PG  - 1580-4
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr658 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis, also called calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare 
      and often fatal complication of end-stage renal disease and is characterized by
      painful skin ulceration, necrosis, medial calcification and intimal proliferation
      of small arteries. Studies in western countries have reported incidences ranging 
      from 1 to 4% in chronic hemodialysis patients. Since no systematic studies of
      calciphylaxis have ever been performed in Japan, we conducted a nationwide survey
      and a case-control study to identify the characteristics of calciphylaxis in the 
      Japanese dialysis population. METHODS: Firstly, we sent a questionnaire to 3760
      hemodialysis centers in Japan, asking whether calciphylaxis cases had been
      encountered in the past, and detailed clinical data regarding each case were then
      collected from the centers. In addition, two control dialysis patients matched
      for age and duration of hemodialysis to each calciphylaxis case were identified
      at the participating centers, and their data were analyzed to identify risk
      factors for calciphylaxis. RESULTS: Responses to the questionnaire were obtained 
      from 1838 centers (48.3%), and 151 centers reported that a total of 249 cases had
      been encountered. Sixty-four centers agreed to participate in the case-control
      study, and detailed clinical data in regard to 67 cases were obtained. In 28 of
      the 67 cases, a definite diagnosis of calciphylaxis was made by our study group
      based on the clinical characteristics and skin biopsy findings. A univariate
      logistic regression model comparing them with 56-matched controls identified
      warfarin therapy [odds ratio (OR) 11.4, 95% confidence interval (CI)] 2.7-48.1,
      P=0.0009], each 1 g/dL decline in serum albumin level (OR 19.8, 95% CI 4.4-89.5, 
      P=0.0001), each 100 mg/dL increment in plasma glucose level (OR 3.74, 95% CI
      1.08-12.9, P=0.037) and each 1 mg/dL increment in adjusted serum calcium level
      (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.63-6.30, P=0.0008) at the time of diagnosis as significantly
      associated with calciphylaxis, but no significant associations were found with
      female gender, vitamin D analog therapy, serum phosphate level, adjusted
      calcium-phosphate products or serum alkaline-phosphatase level. Warfarin therapy 
      and lower serum albumin levels were still significant risk factors after a
      multivariate logistic regression model analysis. CONCLUSION: The results of this 
      study showed that warfarin therapy and lower serum albumin levels are significant
      and strong risk factors for the development of calciphylaxis in chronic
      hemodialysis patients in Japan.

TI  - Risk factors for progression of aortic arch calcification in patients on
      maintenance hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 460-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1542-4758.2011.00571.x [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is accelerated during dialysis and is known to be an
      important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Progression of aortic arch
      calcification (AoAC) can be simply estimated with an AoAC score (AoACS) using
      plain chest radiography. The objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors
      for AoAC progression. The enrolled subjects were 125 newly treated hemodialysis
      patients and 59 peritoneal dialysis patients. In the patients who had undergone
      chest radiography before initial dialysis therapy and every year, we estimated
      AoACS and then divided the patients into two groups based on the presence or
      absence of AoAC progression. We also compared the baseline clinical and
      biochemical profiles in the two groups. Eighty-five (46.2%) were men (mean age,
      58.6 +/- 12.7 years). Seventy-six patients (41.3%) had AoAC before initial
      dialysis, with a mean AoACS of 13.0 +/- 20.4%. The mean duration of follow-up was
      2.7 +/- 1.0 years. Half of the patients (50%) had progressive AoAC. Age >65 years
      (p = 0.003), dialysis duration (p = 0.004), diabetes (p = 0.015), and the
      presence of AoAC at baseline (p = 0.001) were related to AoAC progression. No
      significant association was found between AoAC progression and the baseline
      clinical parameters, including gender, obesity, hypertension, and dialysis
      modality. In a multivariate analysis, dialysis duration (p = 0.003) and the
      presence of AoAC at baseline (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for AoAC
      progression in patients undergoing dialysis. The duration of dialysis and the
      presence of AoAC before initial dialysis were significantly related to the
      progression of AoAC in these patients. The results suggest that patients should
      be carefully managed from the predialysis stage to prevent AoAC progression and
      to reduce cardiovascular morbidity.

TI  - Does cinacalcet HCl, an oral calcimimetic agent for the treatment of secondary
      hyperparathyroidism, improve arterial stiffness in patients on continuous
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis?
PG  - 134-9
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) and arterial stiffness (AS) are major contributors to
      cardiovascular disease, and in chronic kidney disease, VC and AS are correlated. 
      Disorders of calcium and phosphate metabolism contribute to the progression of VC
      and to increases in AS. The efficacy of cinacalcet (CIN) in reducing AS in
      patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has not been
      determined. The present study enrolled 19 CAPD patients (12 women, 7 men; mean
      age: 62.2 +/- 3.6 years) with serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) greater
      than 500 ng/dL (mean value: 675 +/- 106 ng/dL) in whom daily oral treatment with 
      CIN 25 mg was started. If administration of CIN for 3 months failed to reduce the
      level of iPTH to less than 300 ng/dL, the dose of CIN was increased to 50 mg
      daily. Before the start of CIN and at 3 years after the start of CIN, pulse wave 
      velocity (PWV) was determined. In 11 patients, levels of iPTH were reduced to
      less than 300 ng/dL; levels in the rest of the patients remained high. We
      observed no significant differences in PWV before CIN and at 3 years after CIN
      start (1856 +/- 198 cm/s vs. 1726 +/- 187 cm/s). Multivariate regression analysis
      of PWV demonstrated that both systolic blood pressure and changes in serum levels
      of phosphate contributed to decreases in PWV In patients receiving CAPD, VC and
      AS might be the result of higher systolic blood pressure and increased serum

TI  - Lower concentrations of serum phosphorus within the normal range could be
      associated with less calcification of the coronary artery in Koreans with normal 
      renal function.
PG  - 1465-70
LID - 10.3945/ajcn.110.001974 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum phosphorus concentrations are associated with an increased risk
      of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality in patients with renal
      insufficiency. This association has also been reported in Western individuals
      without chronic kidney disease (CKD). OBJECTIVE: It is unclear, however, whether 
      this correlation occurs in Korean individuals without CKD, who usually ingest
      less phosphorus than do Western individuals. DESIGN: We reviewed the findings in 
      402 healthy Korean adults with a mean (+/-SD) age of 50.8 +/- 8.5 y (n = 257 men 
      and 145 women) and a glomerular filtration rate of 83.5 +/- 14.1 mL/min, who
      underwent health screening with electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). The
      study population was separated into 4 groups on the basis of the coronary calcium
      concentration (Agatston score: 0, >0 to </=10, >10 to </=100, and >100). Mean
      serum phosphorus concentrations, measured >/=10 y before EBCT, were compared.
      RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that age (P = 0.001), male sex (P = 0.002),
      family history of CVD (P = 0.006), serum glucose (P = 0.003), and serum
      phosphorus >3.6 mg/dL (P = 0.008) were significant factors influencing the
      coronary calcification group with an Agatston score >100, when those with an
      Agatston score of 0 were considered as the reference group. Compared with the
      group with a serum phosphorus concentration </=3.3 mg/dL, the OR of an Agatston
      score >100 in individuals with a serum phosphorus concentration >3.6 to </=3.9
      mg/dL was 3.89 (95% CI: 1.43, 10.63; P = 0.008) and in those with a serum
      phosphorus concentration >3.9 mg/dL was 3.17 (95% CI: 1.19, 8.41; P = 0.021).
      CONCLUSION: A lower concentration of serum phosphorus within the normal range
      could be associated with less calcification of the coronary artery in Koreans
      with normal renal function.

TI  - Effects of lowering dialysate calcium concentrations on arterial stiffness in
      patients undergoing hemodialysis.
PG  - 320-7
LID - 10.3904/kjim.2011.26.3.320 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We assessed changes in hemodynamic and arterial stiffness
      parameters following reductions of dialysate calcium concentrations in patients
      undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: In this prospective study, 20 patients on
      maintenance hemodialysis (10 females, 10 males) with dialysate calcium
      concentrations of 1.75 mmol/L were enrolled. At the start of the study, the
      dialysate calcium level was lowered to 1.50 mmol/L. Serial changes in
      biochemical, hemodynamic, and arterial stiffness parameters, including pulse wave
      velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx), were assessed every 2 months for 6
      months. We also examined changes in the calcification-inhibitory protein, serum
      fetuin-A. RESULTS: During the 6-month study period, serum total calcium and
      ionized calcium decreased consistently (9.5 +/- 1.0 to 9.0 +/- 0.7, p = 0.002 vs.
      1.3 +/- 0.1 to 1.1 +/- 0.1, p = 0.035). Although no apparent changes in blood
      pressure were observed, heart-femoral PWW (hf-PWV) and AIx showed significant
      improvement (p = 0.012, 0.043, respectively). Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated a
      significant effect of lowering dialysate calcium on hf-PWV (F = 4.58, p = 0.004) 
      and AIx (F = 2.55, p = 0.049). Accompanying the change in serum calcium, serum
      fetuin-A levels significantly increased (95.8 +/- 45.8 pmol/mL at baseline to
      124.9 +/- 82.2 pmol/mL at 6 months, p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Lowering dialysate
      calcium concentration significantly improved arterial stiffness parameters, which
      may have been associated with upregulation of serum fetuin-A.

TI  - Superficial temporal artery calcification in patients with end-stage renal
      disease: Association with vascular risk factors and ischemic cerebrovascular
      disease.
PG  - 215-20
LID - 10.4103/0971-3026.85371 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extracranial superficial temporal artery (STA)
      calcification is an unusual finding seen in patients with chronic kidney disease 
      and has unknown ramifications with respect to intracranial ischemic disease. We
      sought to determine the association between the risk factors for vascular
      calcification and this rare phenomenon, in patients with chronic renal failure,
      and to assess the coexistence of cerebral ischemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Medical records and laboratory data on risk factors for vascular calcification
      were retrospectively retrieved for 453 patients with a discharge diagnosis of
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). CT head examinations were reviewed to identify
      and associate STA calcification with 1) risk factors for the vascular
      calcification, 2) intracranial artery calcification, and 3) cerebral ischemia
      (white matter and/or cortical ischemic changes). RESULTS: STA calcification was
      present in 9.9% (45/453) of the studied cohort. The prevalence of cerebral
      ischemia was 24.4% (11/45) in patients with STA calcification and 9.3% (38/408)
      in patients without it. Diabetes mellitus (OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.059-6.208;
      P=0.037) was independently associated with the risk of STA calcification. The
      risk of cerebral ischemia, however, was not related to STA calcification
      (P=0.221). CONCLUSION: The presence of diabetes mellitus is important in
      describing the risk of STA calcification in patients with ESRD, whereas age,
      gender, hypertension, serum calcium, serum phosphate, or serum hemoglobin levels 
      are not. The risk of cerebral ischemia is not related to STA calcification but
      has the strongest association with diabetes mellitus.

TI  - Progression of coronary artery calcification and thoracic aorta calcification in 
      kidney transplant recipients.
PG  - 258-69
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.07.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification independently predicts cardiovascular disease,
      the major cause of death in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Longitudinal
      studies of vascular calcification in KTRs are few and small and have short
      follow-up. We assessed the evolution of coronary artery (CAC) and thoracic aorta 
      calcification and their determinants in a cohort of prevalent KTRs. STUDY DESIGN:
      Longitudinal. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: The Agatston score of coronary arteries and
      thoracic aorta was measured by 16-slice spiral computed tomography in 281 KTRs.
      PREDICTORS: Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters were recorded
      simultaneously. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: The Agatston score was measured again
      3.5 or more years later. RESULTS: Repeated analyzable computed tomographic scans 
      were available for 197 (70%) KTRs after 4.40 +/- 0.28 years; they were not
      available for the rest of patients because of death (n = 40), atrial fibrillation
      (n = 1), other arrhythmias (n = 4), refusal (n = 35), or technical problems
      precluding confident calcium scoring (n = 4). CAC and aorta calcification scores 
      increased significantly (by a median of 11% and 4% per year, respectively) during
      follow-up. By multivariable linear regression, higher baseline CAC score, history
      of cardiovascular event, use of a statin, and lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) level 
      were independent determinants of CAC progression. Independent determinants of
      aorta calcification progression were higher baseline aorta calcification score,
      higher pulse pressure, use of a statin, older age, higher serum phosphate level, 
      use of aspirin, and male sex. Significant regression of CAC or aorta
      calcification was not observed in this cohort. LIMITATIONS: Cohort of prevalent
      KTRs with potential survival bias; few patients with diabetes and nonwhites,
      limiting the generalizability of results. CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous
      small short-term studies, we show that vascular calcification progression is
      substantial within 4 years in prevalent KTRs and is associated with several
      traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors, some of which are
      modifiable.

      patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2612-9
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03910411 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a cytokine that regulates bone 
      resorption, has been implicated in the process of vascular calcification and
      stiffness. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Serum OPG was measured 
      in 351 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from one site of the
      Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. Cortical bone mineral content (BMC) was
      measured by quantitative computed tomography in the tibia. Multivariable linear
      regression was used to test the association between serum OPG and traditional
      cardiovascular risk factors, measures of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism,
      and pulse wave velocity. RESULTS: Higher serum OPG levels were associated with
      older age, female gender, greater systolic BP, lower estimated GFR, and lower
      serum albumin. OPG was not associated with measures of abnormal bone or mineral
      metabolism including serum phosphorus, albumin-corrected serum calcium, intact
      parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, or cortical BMC. Among
      226 participants with concurrent aortic pulse wave velocity measurements,
      increasing tertiles of serum OPG were associated with higher aortic pulse wave
      velocity after adjustment for demographics, traditional vascular risk factors,
      and nontraditional risk factors such as estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum
      phosphate, corrected serum calcium, presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism,
      serum albumin, and C-reactive protein or after additional adjustment for cortical
      BMC in a subset (n = 161). CONCLUSIONS: These data support a strong relationship 
      between serum OPG and arterial stiffness independent of many potential
      confounders including traditional cardiovascular risk factors, abnormal bone and 
      mineral metabolism, and inflammation.

TI  - Reduced serum fetuin-A in nephrotic children: a consequence of proteinuria?
PG  - 373-80
LID - 10.1159/000331061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extracellular protein fetuin-A is a potent soluble inhibitor of
      calcification, and its deficiency has been associated with vascular calcification
      in dialysis patients. In proteinuric patients, significant urinary losses of
      fetuin-A may cause low serum fetuin-A levels. METHODS: In a cross-sectional
      study, urinary/serum concentrations of fetuin-A were investigated in proteinuric 
      children with glomerular diseases and preserved renal function (n = 58) in
      comparison to healthy controls (n = 246). RESULTS: Mean fetuin-A serum
      concentrations were clearly reduced in children with nephrotic syndrome (0.25 +/-
      0.14 g/l, p < 0.001), slightly reduced in children with large proteinuria (0.39
      +/- 0.15 g/l, p < 0.05), and comparable to controls in those with mild
      proteinuria (0.45 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.46 +/- 0.12 g/l). Fetuin-A was positively
      correlated with serum protein (r = 0.58), albumin (r = 0.57), and calcium (r =
      0.64), but negatively correlated with proteinuria (r = -0.41), albuminuria (r =
      -0.46), and urinary fetuin-A excretion (r = -0.48; each p < 0.001). The
      fractional excretion of fetuin-A was significantly associated with the degree of 
      proteinuria and serum fetuin-A levels. However, the urinary loss of fetuin-A and 
      albumin in nephrotic children differed by three orders of magnitude and the mean 
      fractional excretion of fetuin-A was only 1/10 of that of albumin (0.016 +/-
      0.029 vs. 0.162 +/- 0.403%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Fetuin-A is clearly reduced 
      in children with nephrotic syndrome and associated with the degree of
      hypoalbuminemia. This is due to urinary fetuin-A loss and/or reduced hepatic
      synthesis. Persistent fetuin-A deficiency may have an impact on cardiovascular
      morbidity in nephrotic children.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor limits pulse-wave velocity and aortic
      calcification in a rat model of cystic renal disease.
PG  - F959-66
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00393.2011 [doi]
AB  - The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on function and structure 
      of the aorta was studied in the Lewis polycystic kidney (LPK) rat model of cystic
      renal disease and Lewis controls. Pulse-wave velocity (PWV) was recorded under
      urethane anesthesia (1.3 g/kg ip) in mixed-sex animals aged 6 and 12 wk and in
      12-wk-old animals treated with perindopril (3 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) po) from age 6-12
      wk. Tail-cuff systolic pressures were recorded over the treatment period. After
      PWV measurements, animals were euthanized and the aorta was removed for
      histomorphological and calcium analysis. Hypertension in LPK at 6 and 12 wk was
      associated with a shift of the PWV curve upward and to the right, indicating a
      decrease in aortic compliance, which was significantly reduced by perindopril.
      LPK demonstrated greater aortic calcification (6 wk: 123 +/- 19 vs. 65 +/- 7 and 
      12 wk: 406 +/- 6 vs. 67 +/- 6 mumol/g, P < 0.001, LPK vs. Lewis, respectively).
      This was reduced by treatment with perindopril (172 +/- 48 mumol/g, 12 wk LPK P <
      0.001). Medial cross-sectional area and elastic modulus/wall stress of the aorta 
      were greater in LPK vs. Lewis control animals at 6 and 12 wk of age and showed an
      age-related increase that was prevented by treatment with perindopril (P <
      0.001). Perindopril also ameliorated the degradation of elastin, increase in
      collagen content, and medial elastocalcinosis seen in 12-wk LPK. Overall,
      perindopril improved the structural and functional indices of aortic stiffness in
      the LPK rats, demonstrating a capacity for angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibition to limit vascular remodeling in chronic kidney disease.

TI  - The impact of antihypertensive drug therapy on endotoxemia in elderly patients
      with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2389-94
LID - 10.2215/CJN.11211210 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Endotoxin (ET) is recognized to cause adverse effects 
      on cardiovascular (CV) structure. Circulatory translocation of gut bacterial ET
      is described in heart failure. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older
      people and aggressive BP control is the cornerstone of management. We therefore
      studied ET after improvement of the overall CV milieu with introduction of
      optimized antihypertensive therapy (AHT). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &
      MEASUREMENTS: We recruited 40 hypertensive nondiabetic patients (>/=70 years)
      with CKD stages 3 and 4 and hypertensive non-CKD matched controls. Assessment was
      performed after complete AHT washout and repeated after AHT reintroduction to
      target BP 130/80 mmHg. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and analysis were assessed by
      applanation tonometry, central hemodynamics by continuous digital pulse wave
      analysis, vascular calcification (VC) by superficial femoral artery CT, and serum
      ET by Limulus Amebocyte assay. RESULTS: Mean age was 76 +/- 5 years, estimated
      GFR (eGFR) (CKD group) was 40 +/- 14 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), and achieved BP was
      128/69 mmHg. Washout ET was 0.042 +/- 0.011 EU/ml and was independent of renal
      function, gender, age, BP, VC, arterial stiffness, and high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein. ET significantly decreased with AHT (to 0.020 +/- 0.028
      EU/ml; P < 0.001) and was associated with eGFR (R = -0.38; P = 0.02), arterial
      wave reflection (Augmentation Index R = -0.42; P = 0.01), and degree of tonic
      vasodilatation (total peripheral resistance R = -0.37; P = 0.03), but not VC,
      PWV, gender, age, BP, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS:
      Elderly patients with hypertension have elevated serum ET. Improvement of their
      CV status with optimized AHT is associated with a significant reduction in
      endotoxemia. Further investigation of the potential pathophysiological mechanisms
      linking CV disease and CKD with this previously unappreciated effect of AHT
      appears warranted.

PG  - 880-90
AB  - Little is known about the association between plasma levels of pigment
      epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or chronic
      kidney disease (CKD). This study evaluated 289 consecutive patients with chest
      pain or at least one coronary risk factor who underwent coronary angiography
      using multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT). Presence of CAD and CKD, CAD 
      severity (i.e. number of significantly stenosed coronary vessels, described as
      vessel disease [VD]), coronary calcification scores, visceral fat area (VFA),
      subcutaneous fat area on MDCT, and metabolic biomarkers were recorded. PEDF
      levels correlated significantly with sex, VFA, CKD presence/hyperuricaemia and
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. PEDF levels were closely associated 
      with CKD and were significantly higher in CKD patients than in non-CKD patients, 
      regardless of the presence of CAD. CKD patients with two-VD or three-VD had
      higher plasma PEDF levels than non-CKD patients with two-VD or three-VD. It is
      concluded that PEDF may be associated with CKD regardless of the presence of CAD.

PG  - 519-26
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.04.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with increased
      mortality risk in the general population. Although individuals with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) are at markedly increased mortality risk, the incidence,
      prevalence, and prognosis of CAC in CKD are not well understood. STUDY DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of 1,908
      participants who underwent coronary calcium scanning as part of the multiethnic
      CRIC (Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort) Study. PREDICTOR: Estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) computed using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
      (MDRD) Study equation, stratified by race, sex, and diabetic status. eGFR was
      treated as a continuous and a categorical variable compared with the reference
      value of >60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). MEASUREMENTS: CAC detected using computed
      tomography (CT) using either an Imatron C-300 electron beam computed tomography
      (CT) scanner or multidetector CT scanner. CAC was computed using Agatston score
      as a categorical variable. Analyses were performed using ordinal logistic
      regression. RESULTS: We found a strong and graded relationship between lower eGFR
      and increasing CAC. In unadjusted models, ORs increased from 1.68 (95% CI,
      1.23-2.31) for eGFR of 50-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2) to 2.82 (95% CI, 2.06-3.85) for
      eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Multivariable adjustment only partially attenuated the
      results (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.07-2.20) for eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2). LIMITATIONS:
      Use of eGFR rather than measured GFR. CONCLUSIONS: We showed a graded
      relationship between severity of CKD and CAC independent of traditional risk
      factors. These findings support recent guidelines that state that if vascular
      calcification is present, it should be considered as a complementary component to
      be included in the decision making required for individualizing CKD treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Atherosclerosis, coronary artery calcification, diabetes
      mellitus, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy
      are the most commonly encountered risk factors in the pathogenesis of
      cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Epicardial
      adipose tissue (EAT) is the true visceral fat depot of the heart. The
      relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and EAT was shown in healthy
      subjects and patients with high risk of CAD. To date, there is not enough data
      about EAT in diabetic and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Therefore, we aimed to
      investigate the EAT and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in diabetic
      and nondiabetic ESRD patients and healthy subjects. METHODS: Sixty ESRD patients 
      (17 diabetic, 43 nondiabetic ESRD patients) and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled
      in the study. EAT and CACS were performed by a 64-slice multidetector computed
      tomography scanner. RESULTS: There were no differences in age, gender, body mass 
      index, predialysis systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, biochemical
      parameters including serum low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein between healthy subjects,
      diabetic, and nondiabetic ESRD patients. Total CACSs and EAT measurements were
      significantly higher in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic
      ESRD patients and healthy subjects. There was statistically significant
      relationship between EAT and CACS in ESRD patients (p < 0.0001, r = 0.48).
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we found a significant increase in terms of EAT and
      CACS in diabetic ESRD patients when compared with nondiabetic ESRD patients and
      healthy subjects.

TI  - Impact of chronic kidney disease on carotid plaque vulnerability.
PG  - 1643-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2011.05.049 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the effect of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on
      plaque morphology in cerebral vessels. We therefore analyzed plaque composition
      and metabolic and chemical parameters with regard to clinical outcome in patients
      with advanced carotid artery stenosis (>70%) and normal or impaired renal
      function. METHODS: Carotid endarterectomy plaques were collected from 114
      patients, 51 with CKD and 63 without CKD (mean estimated glomerular filtration
      rate, 49 +/- 9 vs 88 +/- 14 mL/min), and analyzed by histology and
      immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3,
      -7, -8, and -9), calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, fetuin-A,
      osteoprotegerin, and inflammatory factors, including fibrinogen, and
      high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured by appropriate
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Compared with patients without CKD,
      patients with CKD had significantly more early-stage (11.2% vs 2.8%, P = .002)
      and end-stage (7.4% vs 0.2%, P = .036) calcification, unstable (50.8% vs 20.4%, P
      = .001) and ruptured (53.1% vs 32.8%, P = .035) lesions, and a significantly
      lower amount of collagenous fibers (39.2% vs 54.6%, P = .001). Serum samples of
      CKD patients had significantly enhanced levels of fibrinogen (393 +/- 88 vs 331
      +/- 60 mg/dL, P = .018), hsCRP (1.7 +/- 2.9 vs 0.8 +/- 0.9 mg/dL; P = .042),
      parathyroid hormone (47.3 +/- 24.1 vs 32.8 +/- 12.2 ng/L, P = .010), fetuin-A
      (0.21 +/- 0.05 vs 0.18 +/- 0.04 mg/mL, P = .039), and MMP-7 (13.0 +/- 5.3 vs 8.3 
      +/- 3.0 ng/mL; P < 0.001). The incidence of cerebrovascular events >6 months
      before carotid surgery was significantly increased in CKD patients (84.0% vs
      26.2% P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CKD and advanced carotid artery
      stenosis, morphologic changes in plaque composition may contribute to plaque
      vulnerability and consequently to the risk of cerebrovascular events.
      Furthermore, relevant serum markers of inflammation, vascular calcification, and 
      vessel wall degradation might be an indication of stroke risk in CKD patients.

TI  - FGF-23 and osteoprotegerin are independently associated with myocardial damage in
      chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4. Another link between chronic kidney
      disease-mineral bone disorder and the heart.
PG  - 727-33
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr316 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extra-skeletal calcification and disordered phosphate metabolism are 
      hallmarks of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD).
      Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) are increased in
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and have been associated with arterial and cardiac
      dysfunction and reduced survival. Troponin T (cTnT) is released from cardiac
      myocytes under conditions of stress and is predictive of mortality across a range
      of renal functions. However, the utility of this biomarker was formerly limited
      by the lower limit of assay detection. The introduction of a high-sensitivity
      assay has enabled more detailed study of myocyte stress below the previous limit 
      of detection. We studied the association of mediators of CKD-MBD with arterial
      stiffness and also of these mediators and arterial stiffness with myocardial
      damage in patients with CKD stages 3-4. METHODS: OPG and FGF-23 were measured in 
      200 CKD stages 3-4 patients. cTnT was measured using a high-sensitivity assay.
      Aortic stiffness was assessed using aortic pulse wave velocity (APWV). RESULTS:
      Mean age was 69 +/- 11 years, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure was 151 
      +/- 22/81 +/- 11 mmHg and renal function was 33 +/- 11 mL/min/1.73 m(2). OPG,
      FGF-23, high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-cTnT) and APWV all correlated with renal 
      function. After multivariate analysis, OPG and age remained independently
      associated with aortic stiffness. OPG and FGF-23 were independently associated
      with hs-cTnT in addition to other non-traditional risk factors (Model R(2) =
      0.596). CONCLUSION: We have shown that changes in bone mediators and phosphate
      metabolism induced by CKD are independently associated with vascular and
      cardiomyocyte dysfunction. Our findings suggest that cardiac dysfunction may be
      specifically associated with such abnormalities in addition to recognized
      increases in vascular stiffness.

TI  - Prevalence of intracranial artery calcification in hemodialysis patients--a
      case-control study.
PG  - 1223-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-011-0026-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracranial artery calcification has been reported to be an
      independent risk factor for ischemic stroke. Also, existence of a positive
      correlation has been reported between the presence of arterial calcification and 
      that of ischemic changes in the area supplied by such arteries. While
      intracranial artery calcification has frequently been observed on computed
      tomographic (CT) images of the brain in hemodialysis patients, its prevalence has
      not been reported previously. We investigated our hemodialysis outpatients to
      determine the prevalence of intracranial artery calcification in these patients
      in comparison with that in healthy controls. METHODS: Brain CT examinations were 
      performed in 107 patients under maintenance hemodialysis therapy. For comparison,
      43 representatives of the general population who underwent a brain CT examination
      as part of a health checkup were also studied as control subjects. RESULTS:
      Intracranial calcifications were more frequently found among hemodialysis
      patients (87.9%) than among control subjects (53.5%, P = 0.0003), and the
      prevalences of calcification in each of the intracranial arteries in the two
      groups were as follows: vertebral artery (65.5% vs. 25.6%, P = 0.0002), internal 
      carotid artery (62.1% vs. 18.6%, P < 0.0001), basilar artery (34.5% vs. 34.9%,
      ns), anterior cerebral artery (0 vs. 2.3%, ns), middle cerebral artery (24.1% vs.
      20.9%, ns), and posterior cerebral artery (5.2% vs. 4.7%, ns). CONCLUSIONS: A
      much higher rate of intracranial artery calcification was observed in
      hemodialysis patients than in the general population, and the most frequently
      involved sites of calcification in these patients were the relatively large
      intracranial arteries.

TI  - Evaluation of atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and related risk factors in
      chronic hemodialysis patients in Siriraj Hospital.
PG  - S117-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Additional to traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease
      (CVD), recent evidence demonstrates that nontraditional risk factors such as
      high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), hyperhomocysteinemia and vascular
      calcification may cause progressive atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients.
      OBJECTIVE: We aim to determine the prevalence of atherosclerosis and assess the
      arterial stiffness and related risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Common carotid 
      artery intima-media thicknesses (CIMT), atherosclerotic plaque occurrence were
      determined by B-mode ultrasonography in 105 hemodialysis patients (mean age, 53
      +/- 15.5 years; mean dialysis duration 82 +/- 59.5 months). A history of
      clinically significant atherosclerotic vascular disease was elicited by patient
      questionnaire and verified by careful patient chart review and physical
      examination. Cardiovascular ankle index (CAVI) was use to assess arterial
      stiffness. Serum biochemical marker for traditional risk factors, hsCRP and
      homocysteine were measured by standard method. RESULTS: Atherosclerotic vascular 
      disease (defined by a history of CVD or presence of atherosclerotic plaque) was
      present in 79% of patients. Compared to non-atherosclerotic group, the mean CIMT 
      and serum hsCRP in atherosclerotic group was higher (1.9 +/- 0.8 mm vs. 0.8 +/-
      0.6 mm, p < 0.001; 6.5 +/- 8.8 mg/L vs. 3.3 +/- 3.5 mg/L, p = 0.03,
      respectively), while other biochemical markers were not significantly different, 
      as well as the percentage of abnormal CAVI (69% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.28). CAVI was
      positively correlated with maximum carotid intima-meida thickness (r = 0.44, p < 
      0.001). CAVI was also significantly greater in patients with carotid plaque (soft
      plaque (p < 0.05) and calcified plaque (p < 0.05)) compared with patients without
      carotid plaque. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of atherosclerosis and arterial
      stiffness was observed in hemodialysis patients. Carotid atherosclerosis is
      associated with an increased inflammatory marker (hsCRP). CAVI may be a useful
      index to assess arterial stiffness and associated with arterial intima-media
      thickness.

      fistula maturation.
PG  - 437-43
LID - 10.1053/j.ajkd.2011.04.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) for hemodialysis frequently fail to
      mature because of inadequate dilation or early stenosis. The pathogenesis of AVF 
      nonmaturation may be related to pre-existing vascular pathologic states: medial
      fibrosis or microcalcification may limit arterial dilation, and intimal
      hyperplasia may cause stenosis. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING &
      PARTICIPANTS: Patients with chronic kidney disease (N = 50) undergoing AVF
      placement. PREDICTORS: Medial fibrosis, microcalcification, and intimal
      hyperplasia in arteries and veins obtained during AVF creation. OUTCOME &
      MEASUREMENTS: AVF nonmaturation. RESULTS: AVF nonmaturation occurred in 38% of
      patients despite attempted salvage procedures. Preoperative arterial diameter was
      associated with upper-arm AVF maturation (P = 0.007). Medial fibrosis was similar
      in patients with nonmaturing and mature AVFs (60% +/- 14% vs 66% +/- 13%; P =
      0.2). AVF nonmaturation was not associated with patient age or diabetes, although
      both variables were associated significantly with severe medial fibrosis.
      Conversely, AVF nonmaturation was higher in women than men despite similar medial
      fibrosis in both sexes. Arterial microcalcification (assessed semiquantitatively)
      tended to be associated with AVF nonmaturation (1.3 +/- 0.8 vs 0.9 +/- 0.8; P =
      0.08). None of the arteries or veins obtained at AVF creation had intimal
      hyperplasia. However, repeated venous samples obtained in 6 patients during
      surgical revision of an immature AVF showed venous neointimal hyperplasia.
      LIMITATIONS: Single-center study. CONCLUSION: Medial fibrosis and
      microcalcification are frequent in arteries used to create AVFs, but do not
      explain AVF nonmaturation. Unlike previous studies, intimal hyperplasia was not
      present at baseline, but developed de novo in nonmaturing AVFs.

TI  - Early-onset coronary artery disease after pediatric kidney transplantation:
      implicating the angiogenesis inhibitor, endostatin.
PG  - 731-5
AB  - Pediatric kidney transplant recipients have a higher rate of coronary artery
      disease (CAD) as adults. The angiogenesis inhibitor, endostatin, has been
      implicated in the development of atherosclerosis. Endostatin levels will vary
      between adult patients who received a kidney transplant as a child. We conducted 
      a study in young adult patients who had undergone pediatric kidney (n = 12) or
      liver transplantation (n = 8). Coronary arterial calcification was measured using
      electron beam CT. Values were compared with age-matched control subjects from an 
      epidemiologic database. Serum endostatin levels were measured using enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. Risk factors for atherosclerosis were assessed. Kidney
      transplant recipients had a higher rate of CAD compared with liver transplant
      recipients (33 vs 0%, P = 0.03). Mean (+/- standard error of mean) serum
      endostatin levels were higher in kidney transplant recipients compared with liver
      transplant recipients (26 +/- 7 vs 14 +/- 3 ng/mL, P = 0.04) and control subjects
      (26 +/- 7 vs 11 +/- 1 ng/mL, P = 0.01). Pediatric kidney transplantation is
      associated with a higher rate of adult-onset CAD compared with liver
      transplantation. Endostatin levels were greater in kidney transplant recipients
      compared with liver transplant recipients and healthy control subjects.
      Endostatin may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis after kidney
      transplantation and may serve as a biomarker for atherosclerotic disease.

TI  - The effect of immunosuppressive treatment on arterial stiffness and matrix Gla
      protein levels in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 491-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arterial stiffness is a risk marker for cardiovascular events. In
      this study we aimed to compare the effect on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and
      mammalian Target of Rapamycine inhibitors (mTORi) on arterial stiffness in renal 
      transplant patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 81 renal transplant patients under
      CNI-based or mTORi-based protocol for at least 6 months were included in the
      study. Arterial stiffness was measured by using the SphygmoCor device (AtCor
      Medical, Sydney, Australia). Vitamin K-dependent, calcification inhibitor matrix 
      Gla protein (MGP) concentrations were quantified by ELISA methods (Biomedica,
      Vienna, Austria). RESULTS: 34 patients were on mTORi-based and 47 on CNI-based
      immunosuppression. Mean age was 37.9 +/- 10.8 (18 - 71) years and 45% were
      female. Age, gender, graft functions and follow-up period of the groups were
      similar. Augmentation index was 15.2 +/- 12.6% in CNI and 18.8 +/- 14.0% in mTORi
      groups (p > 0.05). There was no difference regarding carotid-femoral pulse wave
      velocity between groups. Arterial stiffness was positively correlated with age,
      total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and proteinuria.
      MGP levels were higher in the mTORi group but were not predictors for
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. CONCLUSION: Rather than specific
      immunosuppressive drug effects, conventional risk factors, blood pressure and
      proteinuria are the most important predictors for arterial stiffness in renal
      transplant patients.

TI  - Lack of association of Klotho gene variants with valvular and vascular
      calcification in Caucasians: a candidate gene study of the Framingham Offspring
      Cohort.
PG  - 3998-4002
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfr188 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Valvular and vascular calcification are important early aging
      phenotypes and represent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
      Klotho is a gene primarily expressed in the kidney that has an important role in 
      calcium-phosphate homeostasis. The functional KL-VS variant of Klotho has been
      associated with aging and cardiovascular disease in human studies, but its role
      in valvular and vascular calcification remains unknown. We performed a candidate 
      gene study in the Framingham Offspring Cohort to evaluate the effect of KL-VS
      variant of the Klotho gene on valvular calcification. METHODS: We analyzed the
      Klotho KL-VS genotype (rs9536314) from the Affymetrix 550K genome-wide dataset,
      distributed by dbGAP, on 1389 cases and 2139 controls from the Framingham Heart
      Study Offspring Cohort. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between
      cases and controls. Valvular calcification was defined as presence of
      calcification on the mitral annulus or the aortic valve as determined by
      echocardiography. A sensitivity analysis of coronary artery calcification by
      electron beam computed tomography was performed on 1363 patients. RESULTS: The
      frequency of the TT versus the TG allele was not different between the cases and 
      the controls (39 versus 41%). The KL-VS variant of Klotho was not associated with
      valvular or vascular calcification, despite adequate power to detect association 
      (86% for odds ratios >/=1.2). In sensitivity analyses, no association (P > 0.001)
      between other common variants of Klotho, beta-Klotho or fibroblast growth
      factor-23 and the end points of valvular or vascular calcification was observed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our adequately powered candidate gene study, we did not observe
      an association with the functional KL-VS variant of Klotho and presence of
      valvular or vascular calcification. Future studies aimed at combining cohorts
      with echocardiographic phenotypes need to be conducted to identify genetic
      variants associated with valvular calcification.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Concern that calcium use may increase cardiovascular risk was 
      previously the domain of nephrologists. By contrast, calcium supplementation has 
      been promoted within the general community as beneficial to the maintenance of
      bone mineral density, as an adjunct to osteoporosis therapies and as potentially 
      useful for cardiovascular health. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies of patients with
      normal serum creatinine levels have reported that combined calcium and vitamin D 
      supplementation reduced fracture risk, and osteoporosis trials have generally
      included calcium and vitamin D in placebo and active arms. However, an increased 
      risk of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular events has now been
      reported in secondary analysis of a fracture study of patients taking calcium or 
      placebo, in subsequent meta-analysis of 15 similar studies, and most recently in 
      re-analysis of the Women's Health Initiative calcium, vitamin D dataset. These
      reports have been criticized regarding event ascertainment, adjudication and the 
      use of composite outcomes. SUMMARY: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      have impaired renal calcium regulation, abnormal bone turnover and are
      predisposed to positive calcium balance. If these general population data are
      proven, they should heighten our unease regarding the use of calcium salts in all
      stages of CKD, and particularly for patients with prevalent vascular
      calcification, suspected adynamic bone and high bone turnover.

TI  - Interleukin 10 and residual kidney function are associated with risk of vascular 
      calcification in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 397-402
AB  - AIMS: Vascular calcification is a common complication among dialysis patients and
      its pathogenesis involves a variety of factors. The roles of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines and residual kidney function (RKF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients
      with vascular calcification have not been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      157 stable PD patients were enrolled. All patients had plain X-ray film
      examination including chest (posterior-anterior view, CXR) and pelvis. Vascular
      calcification was interpreted as calcified deposit over aortic arch and linear
      calcification of pelvic arteries. Relevant biochemical data, pro-inflammatory
      markers, and PD-related factors were measured and collected. RESULTS: Vascular
      calcification prevalence in CXRs was higher than that in pelvis films (38.2% vs. 
      22.3%, p < 0.05). Patients with vascular calcification in CXR had higher
      incidence of calcification in pelvis films (p < 0.05). Only a minor portion
      (14.6%) had two calcification sites. Regression analysis revealed that age, PD
      duration, body mass index, and RKF were independent factors associated with
      vascular calcification in CXR. Age, diabetes, IL-10 and RKF were factors
      associated in pelvis films. Factors independently related to vascular
      calcification in both films were age, duration, diabetes, IL-10, and RKF.
      CONCLUSIONS: Besides traditional risk factors, IL-10 and RKF were important
      factors associated with vascular calcification in PD patients.

      chronic kidney disease rat model.
PG  - F1431-6
LID - 10.1152/ajprenal.00079.2011 [doi]
AB  - Increased aortic pulse-wave velocity (PWV) reflects increased arterial stiffness 
      and is a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease (CKD).
      We examined functional and structural correlations among PWV, aortic
      calcification, and vascular remodeling in a rodent model of CKD, the Lewis
      polycystic kidney (LPK) rat. Hemodynamic parameters and beat-to-beat aortic PWV
      were recorded in urethane-anesthetized animals [12-wk-old hypertensive female LPK
      rats (n = 5)] before the onset of end-stage renal disease and their age- and
      sex-matched normotensive controls (Lewis, n = 6). Animals were euthanized, and
      the aorta was collected to measure calcium content by atomic absorption
      spectrophotometry. A separate cohort of animals (n = 5/group) were anesthetized
      with pentobarbitone sodium and pressure perfused with formalin, and the aorta was
      collected for histomorphometry, which allowed calculation of aortic wall
      thickness, medial cross-sectional area (MCSA), elastic modulus (EM), and wall
      stress (WS), size and density of smooth muscle nuclei, and relative content of
      lamellae, interlamellae elastin, and collagen. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and
      PWV were significantly greater in the LPK compared with Lewis (72 and 33%,
      respectively) animals. The LPK group had 6.8-fold greater aortic calcification,
      38% greater aortic MCSA, 56% greater EM/WS, 13% greater aortic wall thickness,
      21% smaller smooth muscle cell area, and 20% less elastin density with no
      difference in collagen fiber density. These findings demonstrate vascular
      remodeling and increased calcification with a functional increase in PWV and
      therefore aortic stiffness in hypertensive LPK rats.

TI  - The relationship between coronary artery calcification and bone mineral density
      in patients according to their metabolic syndrome status.
PG  - 76-82
LID - 10.4070/kcj.2011.41.2.76 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) is
      closely related to total atherosclerotic plaque burden. However, the pathogenesis
      of CAC is still unclear. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure,
      smoking, and chronic inflammation have been suggested to link vascular
      calcification and bone loss. In the present study, we hypothesized that bone loss
      can contribute to the pathogenesis of CAC in patients with the chronic
      inflammatory condition that accompanies metabolic syndrome (MetS). The objective 
      of this study was to investigate the relationship between CAC and bone mineral
      density (BMD) in patients with MetS and in patients without MetS, by using
      coronary multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data
      from 395 consecutive patients was analyzed retrospectively. From the MDCT
      database, only those patients who underwent both coronary MDCT and dual-energy
      X-ray absorptiometry within an interval of one month, were selected. The presence
      of MetS was determined by the updated criteria as defined by the Third Adult
      Treatment Panel Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program. RESULTS: In
      patients with MetS, a significant correlation was found between CAC and age {odds
      ratio (OR)=1.139, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.080 to 1.201, p<0.001}, CAC and 
      male sex (OR=3.762, 95% CI 1.339 to 10.569, p=0.012), and CAC and T-score of
      L-spine (OR=0.740, 95% CI 0.550 to 0.996, p=0.047) using a forward multiple
      logistic regression analysis model including clinical variables of gender, age,
      lipid profile, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, and
      BMD. But in patients without MetS, BMD by itself was not found to contribute to
      CAC. CONCLUSION: BMD was inversely correlated with CAC only in patients with
      MetS. This finding suggests that low BMD accompanied by MetS, may have
      significant clinical implications.

TI  - Intracranial arterial calcification is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients 
      but does not associate with acute ischemic stroke.
PG  - 256-63

AB  - Intracranial arterial calcification (IAC) is associated with ischemic stroke in
      the general population but this relationship has not been examined in
      hemodialysis patients. We examined the factors associated with IAC and its
      relationship with acute ischemic stroke in this population. We retrospectively
      studied 490 head computed tomographic scans from 2225 hemodialysis patients
      presenting with neurological symptoms at our center (October 2005-May 2009).
      Intracranial arterial calcification was graded using a validated scoring system. 
      Multivariate regression was used to examine the factors associated with the
      presence of IAC, its severity, and its ability to predict acute ischemic stroke. 
      Weibull's survival models analyzed the relationship between IAC severity and
      survival. Ninety-five percent of patients with ischemic stroke had IAC vs. 83% in
      the nonstroke group (P=0.02). Intracranial arterial calcification severity
      increased with age (P<0.001), hemodialysis vintage (P<0.001), serum phosphate
      (P<0.05), and major comorbidities. In patients with multiple computed tomographic
      scans during the study period, increased IAC severity at baseline was predictive 
      of acute ischemic stroke (P=0.05) on logistic regression analysis. High-grade and
      not low-grade IAC was associated with worse survival (P=0.008). Intracranial
      arterial calcification is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients, especially
      in those with acute ischemic stroke. Its severity is prognostically significant
      and associated with risk factors for vascular calcification and may confer a
      greater risk of acute ischemic stroke. The mechanisms underlying the high
      incidence of ischemic stroke in this patient group require further comprehensive 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on hemodialysis present an increased risk of cardiovascular 
      death. Intimal media thickness (IMT) and presence of arterial calcifications are 
      well-known risk factors for cardiovascular death in hemodialysis patients.
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of IMT and arterial calcifications in HD
      patients and to correlate image findings with clinical and laboratory data.
      METHODS: Cross-sectional study involving 75 patients on dialysis for >12 months. 
      Patients underwent B-mode ultrasound scan (US) for determination of IMT of the
      distal third of the common carotid arteries. Arterial calcifications were
      assessed by US of carotids, femoral and tibial arteries, and labeled positive if 
      calcification was found in any arterial site. RESULTS: Patients were 52+/-13
      years old, 57% were males and 16% were diabetics. IMT > 0.9 mm was found in 57%
      of cases and arterial calcifications at US in 48%. Aging (decades) and smoking
      were associated with both increased IMT (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.4, p <
      0.001; aOR = 4.4, p = 0.045, respectively) and presence of vascular
      calcifications (aOR = 3.0, p < 0.001; aOR = 6.8, p = 0.011, respectively). High
      intact parathyroid hormone levels (per each 100 pg/ml) were significantly
      associated with increased IMT (aOR = 1.7, p = 0.021), but not with vascular
      calcification. In contrast, Diabetes and time on dialysis (years) were
      significant determinants for calcifications at US (aOR = 15.0, p = 0.009; aOR =
      1.39, p = 0.020), but not for increased IMT. CONCLUSION: Increased IMT and
      calcifications at US are common findings in hemodialysis patients. Aging and
      smoking are consistent determinants for both image alterations. Parathyroid
      hormone elevation is associated with increased IMT. Diabetes and time on dialysis
      substantially increase the risk for arterial calcification.

TI  - Association of bone turnover markers and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis
      chronic kidney disease (CKD).
PG  - 1127-32
LID - 10.1016/j.bone.2011.01.016 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in CKD and leads to increased
      vascular stiffness and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Non-traditional
      cardiovascular risk factors include abnormal bone turnover and/or dysregulation
      of the calcification inhibitors, although their relative contribution remains
      unclear. We investigated the association between bone turnover, the calcification
      inhibitors (matrix gla protein; MGP and Fetuin-A), and the phosphate regulating
      hormone; fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and arterial stiffness in
      pre-dialysis CKD patients. One hundred and forty-five patients with CKD stages
      1-4 (74 M, 71 F) aged (mean [SD]) 53 [14] years were studied. Bone turnover
      markers (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and tartrate-resistant acid
      phosphatase (TRACP)) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 were determined. BMD was
      measured at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), forearm (FARM) and total
      hip (TH). Arterial stiffness was assessed by contour analysis of digital volume
      pulse (SI(DVP)). There was a significant positive correlation between TRACP:BALP 
      ratio and SI(DVP) ( r=0.19, p=0.023). Following multi-linear regression analysis,
      significant associations were seen between serum BALP (p=0.037), TRACP (p=0.009) 
      and TRACP:BALP ratio (p=0.001) and SI(DVP) independently of traditional CVD risk 
      factors. No significant relationship between SI(DVP) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23
      was observed. A significant negative correlation was seen between BMD at the FARM
      and SI(DVP) in CKD stage 4 (r=-0.35, p=0.024). The association remained
      significant following correction for age, gender and cardiovascular risk factors 
      (p=0.029). Our data suggest a link between imbalances in bone turnover and
      arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD. Longitudinal studies are needed to
      evaluate the clinical usefulness of these bone turnover markers as predictors of 
      CVD in CKD.

TI  - [Risk stratification by cardiac gated SPECT combined with coronary artery calcium
      score in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or renal failure].
PG  - 1122-9
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate added value of coronary artery calcium
      score (CAC) measurement as an adjunct to cardiac gated SPECT for risk
      stratification in population of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and/or
      chronic renal failure on hemodialysis (CHRF-HD). METHODS: Retrospective analysis 
      of 67 patients, who were referred for stress gated myocardial perfusion SPECT and
      CAC. Characteristics of study population: 40 men, mean age 59 +/- 12 years, DM (n
      = 28), CHRF-HD (n = 22), DM and CHRF-HD simultaneously (n = 17). Perfusion summed
      stress and different scores (SSS, SDS), the left ventricle ejection fraction
      (LVEF) and enddiastolic/endsystolic volumes (EDV/ESV) were automatically
      calculated using 4D-MSPECT software. The hard cardiac event was defined as sudden
      cardiac death or myocardial infarction (MI); angina or other symptoms requiring
      coronary revascularization were also calculated. RESULTS: During the average
      period of 18 +/- 10 months, we registered 8 cardiac deaths, 4 nonfatal MI and 7
      patients underwent revascularization. In the subgroup of 19 patients with cardiac
      events, the observed parameters were significantly worse concerning perfusion
      (SSS 9 +/- 11 vs 2 +/- 3 and SDS 6 +/- 9 vs 1 +/- 2, P < 0.05), the left
      ventricle function (stress LVEF 53% +/- 13% vs 59% +/- 13%, rest LVEF 55% +/- 14%
      vs 59% +/- 12%, stress EDV/ESV 144 ml/71 ml vs 128 ml/59 ml, P < 0.05), and CAC
      score (1 965 +/- 1 772 vs 387 +/- 740, P < 0.05) in comparison with patients
      without cardiac event. In patients without a reversible perfusion abnormality
      (SDS < 2), we observed lower annual hard event rate (8% vs 19.6%, P < 0.05) and
      revascularization procedures (4% vs 19.6%, P < 0.05) in comparison with patients 
      with SDS > or = 2. In patients with or without reversible defects, we registered 
      significantly higher annual hard event rate in the setting of post-stress
      worsening of the LVEF > 5% and/or severe CAC score > or = 709 (23.8% vs 1.9% in
      patients with SDS < 2, and 26.7% vs 9.5% in patients with SDS > or = 2, P <
      0.05). CONCLUSION: The findings of highly elevated CAC score as well as the
      post-stress left ventricle stunning enable further risk stratification in
      patients with or without reversible perfusion abnormalities.

TI  - The prognosis of diabetic patients with high ankle-brachial index depends on the 
      coexistence of occlusive peripheral artery disease.
PG  - 984-91
LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2010.10.054 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: High ankle-brachial index (ABI) (>1.40) is associated with poor
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) prognosis. Concomittant peripheral artery disease
      (PAD) is frequent, although undetectable with the ABI in this situation. We
      assessed the prognostic value of a high ABI according to the coexistence of
      occlusive PAD in diabetics. METHODS: In this retrospective longitudinal study, we
      reviewed the data of 403 consecutive diabetic patients (hospitalized in tertiary 
      care teaching hospital) who had a Doppler assessment of their lower limbs between
      1999 and 2000. They were classified as "normal" when Doppler waveform patterns
      (DWP) were normal and ABI within the 0.91 to 1.39 range, "occlusive-PAD (O-PAD)" 
      when ABI </=0.90, or in case of abnormal DWP with normal ABI, "isolated medial
      calcinosis (IMC)" if ABI >/=1.40 with normal DWP, and "mixed disease (MD)" when
      ABI >/=1.40 with abnormal DWP. The primary outcome was the occurrence of any of
      the following events: death, stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), and acute
      coronary syndrome. RESULTS: The patients (65.6 +/- 13.2 years, 54.6% females)
      were classified as normal (14.4%), O-PAD (48.4%), IMC (16.4%), and MD (20.8%).
      During a mean follow-up of 6.5 years, the event-free survival curves of O-PAD and
      MD groups showed equally poorer prognosis than the IMC and normal groups.
      Adjusted for age, sex, diabetes type and duration, traditional CVD risk factors, 
      chronic kidney disease, CVD history and treatments, the presence of occlusive
      disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.21, 1.16-4.22, P = .016), but not medial
      calcinosis, was significantly associated with the primary outcome. CONCLUSIONS:
      In diabetics with ABI >1.40, only those with concommittant occlusive PAD have
      poorer prognosis.

TI  - [Cardiovascular calcification and five-years mortality in patients on maintenance
      hemodialysis].
PG  - 1162-5
AB  - The very high cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in hemodialyzed patients
      (HD) is strongly associated with cardiovascular calcification. The aim of the
      study was to find the predictors of mortality in HD patients during 5-years
      observation period. The study group was composed of 64 patients (35 F, 29 M) aged
      25-75 years (mean 48.9) hemodialyzed three times a week for 12-275 months (mean
      77.8). The levels of hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, Ca, P, Ca x P, iPTH,
      cholesterol, triglycerides, fibrinogen, insulin, homocysteine, leptin,
      procalcitonin, CRP, IL-6, TGF-beta, PDGF were assessed and all patients underwent
      Calcium Score (CS) of coronary arteries (CACS) calculation using MSCT and B-mode 
      ultrasound of carotid arteries for intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), as well as
      echocardiographic assessment with LVMI calculation and heart valves evaluation at
      the start of observation. The self-elaborated Cumulative Calcification Index
      (CCl) was calculated as a sum of CACS Index according to Rumberger et al.
      (CS<10-0, 10<CS<100-1, 100<CS<400 - 2, CS>400 - 3 points); number of calcified
      plaques in carotid arteries (0-0, 1 - 1, 2 - 2, 3 and more - 3 points) and the
      number of calcified heart valves. At the start of the study the median value of
      CCl was 4 and interquartile range 4. Only 2 (3%) patients were free of any type
      of cardiovascular calcification (CCl =0), 15 (23%) patients had minimal
      calcification (CCl 1 to 2 points), 33 (52%) average (2 - 6 points) and 14 (22%)
      patients had severe calcification (CCl>6). 21 (32,8%) patients died during
      observation period. Patients who died were older (56.9 vs. 45.3 yrs.) and had
      higher CS at the start (1275 vs. 356), higher CCA-IMT (0.948 vs. 0.687 mm) and
      CCl (6.15 vs. 3.63) values. Those patients had also higher CRP (0.645 vs. 0.245
      mg/dl) and IL-6 (10.16 vs. 4.15 pg/ml) levels (p<0.05). LVMI and mean:
      hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, Ca, P, Ca x P, iPTH, cholesterol,
      triglycerides, fibrinogen, insulin, homocysteine, leptin, procalcitonin, TGF-beta
      as well as PDGF levels did not differ between the groups. In logistic regression 
      model (p<0.00002), among tested parameters only CCl was an independent and
      statistically significant factor of mortality with OR=1.82 per every point of CCl
      (p<0.0003). Cardiovascular calcification expressed as CCl confirmed to be a

TI  - Association between very low PTH levels and poor survival rates in haemodialysis 
      patients: results from the French ARNOS cohort.
PG  - c211-6
LID - 10.1159/000321642 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A very low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (VLPL) is associated
      with an increased risk of adynamic bone disease, vascular calcification, and
      mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the 
      frequency, the associated factors, and the prognosis of non-surgical VLPL in a
      cohort of prevalent HD patients. METHODS: In July 2005, a cross-sectional study
      was performed on the French ARNOS cohort in 1,348 prevalent HD patients from 24
      dialysis centres in the Rhone-Alpes area. Patients with a baseline intact PTH
      level <50 pg/ml (VLPL, Group 1) and >/= 50 pg/ml (Group 2) were compared and a
      42-month survival analysis was performed. Patients with prevalent or incident
      parathyroidectomy were excluded. RESULTS: We studied 1,138 prevalent HD patients.
      As compared to patients of Group 2 (n = 1,019), patients with VLPL (Group 1, n = 
      119) had lower serum albumin levels (34.5 +/- 5 vs. 36.4 +/- 5 g/l, p < 0.0001), 
      less protein intake (nPCR 0.99 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.28 g/kg/day, p = 0.01),
      higher calcaemia (2.30 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.26 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.01) and were more
      frequently treated with calcium carbonate (67 vs. 54%, p < 0.001). Patients with 
      VLPL had a higher mortality rate (HR: 1.4 (1.07-1.8), p = 0.006) after adjustment
      for age, gender, diabetes, and dialysis vintage. The odds ratios of mortality for
      patients with VLPL remained higher in all calcaemia and serum albumin quartiles. 
      Only 3/119 patients in Group 1 did not receive any PTH-lowering therapies (i.e.
      calcium carbonate (67%), alfacalcidol (38%), cinacalcet (10.1%), and dialysate
      calcium >/= 1.5 mmol/l (94%)). CONCLUSION: In this observational French cohort,
      VLPL was observed in 10% of prevalent HD patients and was associated with poor
      survival rates. An inadequate therapeutic strategy could be responsible for this 
      observation. The real consequences of this iatrogenic adynamic bone disease
      remain hypothetical, but it may be related to the risk of developing vascular
      calcification. It is hypothesized that a more adequate strategy, using fewer
      PTH-lowering therapies in cases of VLPL, may help in improving the poor
      prognosis.

TI  - Serum fibroblast growth factor-23 levels and progression of aortic arch
      calcification in non-diabetic patients on chronic hemodialysis.
PG  - 217-23
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification is a cause of cardiovascular death in hemodialysis
      (HD) patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship
      between the progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) and serum fibroblast 
      growth factor (FGF)-23. METHODS: The enrolled study subjects were 127 (83 men and
      44 women) HD patients. Calcification of the aortic arch was semiquantitatively
      estimated with a score (AoACS) on plain chest radiology. Change in AoACS
      (DeltaAoACS) was obtained by subtracting the baseline AoACS value from the
      follow-up AoACS value. The second assessment was performed from 5 years after the
      first determination. RESULTS: The percentage of male gender in non-progressors
      (58.5%) was lesser than in regressors (60.0%) and progressors (74.6%). In
      addition, the dialysis duration in regressors (14.1+/-5.1 years) was shorter than
      in non-progressors (19.5+/-7.0 years) and progressors (16.8+/-7.5 years).
      Interestingly, the serum FGF-23 level in regressors (39225.5+/-9247.9 pg/mL) was 
      significantly higher than in non-progressors (12896.5+/-26323.5 pg/mL) and
      progressors (14062.4+/-18456.8 pg/mL). Multi-ple regression analyses showed male 
      gender (beta value=0.969, F=5.092, p=0.0192), serum levels of albumin (beta
      value=-1.395, F=4.541, p=0.0296) and log FGF-23 (beta value=-0.001, F=7.273,
      p=0.0115) to be significant independent determinants of DeltaAoACS. CONCLUSION:
      Changes in AoAC evaluated by using a simple chest radiograph are associated with 
      serum FGF-23 levels. Excess accumulation of FGF-23 in serum may enable to inhibit
      the calcification process in vessel walls in chronic HD patients.

TI  - Serum level of soluble Hsp70 is associated with vascular calcification.
PG  - 257-65
LID - 10.1007/s12192-010-0237-3 [doi]
AB  - It has been previously reported that serum levels of 70-kDa heat shock protein
      (Hsp70) are elevated in peripheral artery disease. The aim of the present study
      was to examine whether increased serum Hsp70 levels are related to the extent of 
      arterial calcification and standard laboratory parameters of patients with
      peripheral artery disease, as well as to markers of inflammation (C-reactive
      protein), atherosclerosis (homocysteine), and calcification (fetuin-a). One
      hundred eighty chronic atherosclerotic patients with significant carotid stenosis
      and/or lower extremity vascular disease were enrolled in this cross-sectional
      study. Systemic atherosclerosis and calcification was assessed by ultrasound
      (carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), presence of calcification at the abdominal
      aorta, carotid and femoral bifurcations, and aortic and mitral cardiac valves).
      Standard serum markers of inflammation, diabetes, renal function, ankle-brachial 
      indexes, and traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis were noted. Serum Hsp70
      levels were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Standard laboratory 
      parameters (clinical chemistry), C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine
      levels were determined by an autoanalyzer using the manufacturer's kits. Fetuin-a
      levels were measured by radial immunodiffusion. Patients' median age was 64
      (57-71) years, 69% were men, and 34.5% had diabetes. Serum heat shock protein 70 
      levels were significantly higher in patients with more severe arterial
      calcification (p < 0.02) and showed significant positive correlations with serum 
      bilirubin (r = 0.23, p = 0.002) and homocysteine levels (r = 0.18, p = 0.02).
      Serum Hsp70 did not correlate with body mass index, IMT, CRP, or fetuin-a levels 
      in this cohort. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the association between
      sHsp70 and calcification score (OR, 2.189; CI, 1.156-4.144, p = 0.016) and this
      correlation remained significant (OR, 2.264; CI, 1.021-5.020, p = 0.044) after
      the adjustment for age, sex, eGFR, smoking, CRP, and homocysteine levels. Our
      data show that serum Hsp70 levels correlate with the severity of atherosclerosis 
      in patients with carotid artery disease and chronic lower limb ischemia. These
      data support a putative role for plasma Hsp70 in the development of arterial
      calcification. Nevertheless, further studies are required to investigate the
      usefulness of circulating Hsp70 level as a marker of atherosclerotic
      calcification.

PG  - 3123-5
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2010.05.123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of classic cardiovascular risk factors in
      patients undergoing dialysis therapy or transplantation is associated with a 3.5-
      to 50-fold higher risk than in the general population. The primary cause of death
      in transplant recipients is cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: To report
      echocardiographic findings using a screening protocol to detect heart disease in 
      candidates for kidney transplantation. METHODS: Between November 2005 and
      December 2009, we examined 356 patients using 2-dimensional color Doppler
      echocardiography. RESULTS: A high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy,
      left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, valvulopathy, and valve calcification was
      observed. There was a positive correlation between valve calcification and female
      sex, age (P<.001), duration of renal replacement therapy (P=.01), peripheral
      arterial disease (P=.02), cerebrovascular disease (P=.005), and high
      concentration of lipoprotein(a) (P=.02). CONCLUSION: An echocardiographic study
      should be part of the initial evaluation in candidates for renal transplantation.

TI  - Plasma fibroblast growth factor-23 levels are independently associated with
      carotid artery atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 425-32
LID - 10.1111/j.1542-4758.2010.00480.x [doi]
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has been suggested to play a role in
      vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. Common carotid artery
      intima-media thickness (CIMT) assessment and common carotid artery (CCA) plaque
      identification using ultrasound are well-recognized tools for identification and 
      monitoring of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to test that elevated
      FGF-23 levels might be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in
      maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this cross-sectional study, plasma
      FGF-23 concentrations were measured using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay kit. Carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured and
      CCA plaques were identified by B-Mode Doppler ultrasound. One hundred
      twenty-eight maintenance HD patients (65 women and 63 men, mean age: 55.5 +/- 13 
      years, mean HD vintage: 52 +/- 10 months, all patients are on HD thrice a week)
      were involved. The mean CIMT were higher with increasing tertiles of plasma
      FGF-23 levels (0.66 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.75 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.86 +/- 0.20 mm, P<0.0001).
      Log plasma FGF-23 were higher in patients with plaques in CCA than patients free 
      of plaques (3.0 +/- 0.17 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.23, P<0.0001). Significant correlation was
      recorded between log plasma FGF-23 and CIMT (r=0,497, P=0.0001). In multiple
      regression analysis, a high log FGF-23 concentration was a significant
      independent risk factor of an increased CIMT. Further studies are needed to
      clarify whether an increased plasma FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential
      mechanism for atherosclerosis in patients with end-stage renal disease.

TI  - Large artery calcification on dialysis patients is located in the intima and
      related to atherosclerosis.
PG  - 303-10
LID - 10.2215/CJN.04290510 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification (VC) has a significant effect
      in cardiovascular diseases on dialysis patients. However, VC is assessed with
      x-ray-based techniques, which do not inform about calcium localization (intima,
      media, atherosclerosis-related). The aim of this work is to study VC and its
      related factors using arterial ultrasound to report the exact location of
      calcium. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was an
      observational, cross-sectional, case-control study that included 232 patients in 
      dialysis and 208 age- and sex-matched controls with normal kidney function.
      Demographic data and laboratory values were collated. Carotid, femoral, and
      brachial ultrasounds were performed to assess VC and atherosclerosis burden using
      a standardized protocol. RESULTS: Cardiovascular risk factors were predominantly 
      found in controls, although the burden of atherosclerosis was higher in the
      dialysis group. VC was significantly more prevalent in the group of patients on
      dialysis than control subjects, and in both groups the most prevalent pattern of 
      VC was linear calcification located in the intima of the artery wall. Age and
      undergoing dialysis (with or without previous cardiovascular diseases) were
      positively and significantly associated with linear calcification. Conversely,
      the absence of atherosclerosis and low levels of C-reactive protein and
      phosphorus significantly impeded the development of linear calcification.
      CONCLUSIONS: VC in large, conduit arteries is more prevalent in patients on
      dialysis than controls and is predominantly located in a linear fashion in the
      intima of the arteries.

TI  - Vascular calcifications and renal osteodystrophy in chronic hemodialysis
      patients: what is the relationship between them?
PG  - 1179-86
LID - 10.1007/s11255-010-9841-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and renal osteodystrophy (ROD) are
      frequently seen together and represent the major causes of morbidity and
      mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Some studies suggest a pathogenic link
      between them, but there is no consensus as yet regarding this issue. The main
      objective of our study was to establish whether there is any relation between VCs
      and ROD in our HD patients. We evaluated the prevalence of VCs and ROD and the
      relationship between VCs and some clinical and biochemical characteristics of HD 
      patients. METHODS: We examined radiological signs of VCs and ROD on hands and
      pelvis bone radiographs in 81 chronic HD patients, and we calculated a VC score
      on this basis. RESULTS: We found a significant relation between radiological
      signs of ROD and those of VC (P = 0.019). The patients with ROD had a higher mean
      VC score (P = 0.02). By linear regression, the VC score correlated directly with 
      serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and CaxP
      product and inversely with serum albumin. The logistic regression model revealed 
      that ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium salts were predictive of VCs
      development. There were no associations between VCs and age, HD vintage,
      diabetes, dialysate Ca concentration, vitamin D treatment, spKt/V, URR and
      C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. CONCLUSION: There seems to be a pathogenetic
      link between bone and artery diseases in chronic HD patients. Both VCs and ROD
      have a high prevalence. ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium salts are
      risk factors for VCs.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease and carotid atherosclerosis.
PG  - 47-51
LID - 10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2010.03.018 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. 
      The association between carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and chronic kidney
      disease is controversial, however. In addition, whether renal dysfunction
      promotes vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease is not
      clear. The study subjects were 1003 patients aged >/=50 years who underwent
      carotid ultrasonography in our hospital. Kidney function was evaluated based on
      the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the presence of proteinuria. 
      Patients with end-stage renal failure were excluded. We measured the mean max-IMT
      (which indicates mean maximal wall thickness) at 12 carotid segments, and
      examined the characteristics of the maximal plaques by carotid ultrasonography.
      We evaluated the association between mean max-IMT and eGFR, and also evaluated
      the clinical factors associated with mean max-IMT and calcification of the
      maximal plaques. We found that eGFR was significantly correlated with mean
      max-IMT. Reduced eGFR, proteinuria, age, male sex, cardiovascular disease,
      hypertension, diabetes, and smoking were independently associated with mean
      max-IMT in multiple regression analysis. Kidney function was not associated with 
      calcified plaque. Kidney dysfunction was associated with carotid atherosclerosis 
      in patients with mild or moderate chronic kidney disease.

      Japanese hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1695-701
LID - 10.1007/s00198-010-1377-0 [doi]
AB  - UNLABELLED: A high circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level may be a risk factor
      for vascular calcification and mortality in hemodialysis patients. OPG and pulse 
      wave velocity (PWV) were measured at baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term 
      (>3 years) Japanese hemodialysis patients who were prospectively followed for 6
      years. In long-term normoalbuminemic Japanese hemodialysis patients, OPG levels
      were strongly linked with both arterial stiffness and worse outcome.
      INTRODUCTION: A high circulating OPG level is reported to be a risk factor for
      vascular calcification and mortality in Western chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      patients but it is not known if this is true for Japanese CKD patients, where a
      different risk profile may operate. METHODS: OPG and PWV were measured at
      baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term (>3 years) Japanese hemodialysis
      patients (median age 62 years) who were prospectively followed for 6 years.
      RESULTS: OPG levels were associated in multivariate analysis with age, dialysis
      vintage, history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and parathyroid hormone levels. 
      C-reactive protein levels did not correlate with OPG. Patients with clinical
      history of CVD had significantly higher OPG levels and OPG levels were positively
      correlated to PWV, an index of arterial stiffness. These associations were
      independent of age, sex, dialysis vintage, and diabetes. During the follow-up
      period, 40 deaths, including 25 cardiovascular deaths, were recorded. In crude
      analysis, each unit of increase in OPG was associated with increased all-cause
      (hazard ratios 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.20) and CVD mortality (1.14
      [1.07-1.21]), which persisted after adjustment for age, sex, dialysis vintage,
      diabetes, and baseline CVD (1.12 [1.05-1.19] and 1.11 [1.02-1.19], all-cause and 
      CVD mortality, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In long-term normoalbuminemic Japanese
      hemodialysis patients, with low prevalence of inflammation, OPG levels were
      strongly linked with both arterial stiffness and worse outcome.

TI  - The link between bone and coronary calcifications in CKD-5 patients on
      haemodialysis.
PG  - 1010-5
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications are frequent in Stage 5 chronic kidney
      disease (CKD-5) patients receiving haemodialysis. The current study was designed 
      to evaluate the associations between bone turnover/volume and coronary artery
      calcifications (CAC). METHODS: In 207 CKD-5 patients, bone biopsies, multislice
      computed tomography of the coronary arteries and blood drawings for relevant
      biochemical parameters were done. The large number of CKD-5 patients enrolled
      allowed separate evaluation of patients with CAC versus patients without CAC and 
      adjustment for traditional and non-traditional risk factors for CAC. RESULTS:
      When all patients were analysed, associations were found between CAC and bone
      turnover, bone volume, age, gender and dialysis vintage. When only patients with 
      CAC were included, there was a U-shaped relationship between CAC and bone
      turnover, whilst the association with bone volume was lost. In these patients,
      the relationship of CAC with age, gender and dialysis vintage remained.
      CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the non-modifiable risk factors of age, gender and dialysis
      vintage, these data show that bone abnormalities of renal osteodystrophy amenable
      to treatment should be considered in the management of patients with CAC.

AB  - Bisphosphonates appear to regulate mineralization in both bone and vasculature.
      Degenerative aortic stenosis (AS) is thought to be due to vascular calcification.
      We studied the effect of bisphosphonates on the progression of degenerative AS. A
      retrospective study was performed on patients >70 years, who had transthoracic
      echocardiograms (TTE) >1 year apart and an initial aortic valve area (AVA) of
      0.6-2.0 cm(2). Patients were excluded if they had an ejection fraction <40%,
      other significant valvular or congenital heart disease, end-stage renal disease
      or heart transplant. The cohort was divided depending on the use of
      bisphosphonates. Data were obtained by review of the TTE reports. AVA, peak and
      mean aortic valve gradient (AVG), and the change between the studies were
      calculated. Of 4,270 patients screened for AS, 76 patients fit study criteria
      with 8 in the bisphosphonate group and 68 in the nonbisphosphonate group. The
      period between the TTEs was 23 +/- 5 months in both the groups. AVA in the
      nonbisphosphonate group worsened by 0.2 cm(2) and in the bisphosphonate group it 
      improved by 0.1 cm(2) (P = 0.001 vs. nonbisphosphonate). The changes in peak and 
      mean AVG between groups and compared to baseline were not significant.
      Bisphosphonates show promise for slowing the progression of degenerative AS.

TI  - Serum alkaline phosphatase and mortality in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 91-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alkaline phosphatase is typically considered as an innocent
      by-stander, but emerging data suggest that alkaline phosphatase might play a
      pathogenic role in vascular calcification and thus contribute to increased
      mortality in hemodialysis patients. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal analyses of the
      existing HEMO Study database. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 1,827 HEMO Study
      participants. PREDICTOR: Serum alkaline phosphatase level. OUTCOME AND
      MEASUREMENTS: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: Based on the
      median serum alkaline phosphatase of 97 IU/l, participants were divided into low 
      (< 97 IU/l) and high (> or = 97 IU/l) serum alkaline phosphatase groups. The
      lower serum alkaline phosphatase group was associated with older age, male
      gender, non-black race and shorter dialysis years as well as higher serum
      calcium, higher serum calcium-phosphorus product and lower parathyroid hormone
      levels. Mean serum liver enzyme values were in the normal range in both groups,
      but the high alkaline phosphatase group had slightly higher values. In a
      multivariate time-dependent Cox model using baseline and follow-up values of
      serum alkaline phosphatase levels, adjusted for demographics, HEMO Study groups, 
      comorbidity, bone metabolism parameters and liver enzymes, each doubling of serum
      alkaline phosphatase was significantly associated with increased hazard of
      all-cause (hazard ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.30 - 1.59) and cardiovascular mortality
      (hazard ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.16 - 1.57). LIMITATIONS: Nonstandardized
      measurements of alkaline phosphatase. CONCLUSIONS: Serum alkaline phosphatase is 
      associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis patients, independent of bone
      metabolism parameters and liver enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase might be a
      potential therapeutic target in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 and fetuin A are independent predictors for the
      coronary artery disease extent in mild chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 1780-6
LID - 10.2215/CJN.02560310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      is explained in part by traditional cardiovascular risk factors; by
      uremia-specific factors; and by abnormalities of mineral metabolism, factors
      involved in its regulation, and in the vascular calcification process. DESIGN,
      SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In an unselected population of 177
      patients with calculated GFR (eGFR) between 90 and 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), the
      link between the mineral metabolism abnormalities (calcium, phosphorus,
      calcium-phosphorus product), regulatory factors (parathyroid hormone [PTH],
      intact PTH [iPTH], vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF 23], and fetuin
      A), and the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) assessed by coronary
      angiography were evaluated in three subgroups defined by tertiles of Gensini
      lesion severity score. RESULTS: The mean serum values for FGF 23 in the entire
      study population was 28.1 +/- 17.3 RU/ml and for fetuin A was 473.1 +/- 156.2
      mug/ml. Patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had significantly higher
      values of FGF 23 compared with patients with eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). The 
      Gensini score values significantly correlated with gender; arterial hypertension;
      and HDL cholesterol, eGFR, iPTH, FGF 23, and fetuin A levels. After the
      adjustments for traditional and uremia-related cardiovascular risk factors, the
      FGF 23 and fetuin A remained significant predictors of the Gensini score.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in a relatively young population with
      mild-to-moderate alteration of kidney function and with less traditional
      cardiovascular risk factors, anomalies of the serum FGF 23 and fetuin A levels
      appear early in the course of disease and are independent major predictors for
      extent of CAD.

TI  - Chondrocyte rather than osteoblast conversion of vascular cells underlies medial 
      calcification in uremic rats.
PG  - 1741-50
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.204834 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate cell biological changes in calcified aortas of rats
      that experienced chronic renal failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vascular smooth
      muscle cells have the potential to transdifferentiate to either chondrocytes or
      osteoblasts, depending on the molecular pathways that are stimulated.
      Uremia-related medial calcification was induced by feeding rats an adenine
      low-protein diet for 4 weeks. Aortic calcification was evaluated biochemically
      and histochemically and with in vivo micro-computed tomographic scanning.
      Immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR were applied to analyze the time-dependent aortic
      expression of molecules involved in the segregation between the chondrocyte
      versus osteoblast differentiation pathway. After 4 weeks, 85% of the uremic rats 
      had developed distinct aortic medial calcification, which increased to severely
      calcified lesions during further follow-up. The calcification process was
      accompanied by a significant time-dependent increase in the expression of the
      chondrocyte-specific markers sex determining region Y-box 9 (sox9), collagen II, 
      and aggrecan and a nonsignificant trend toward enhanced core binding factor alpha
      1 (cbfa1), and collagen I. The expression of the osteoblast marker osterix and
      both lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 and beta-catenin, molecules of the
      wingless-type MMTV integration site family member (Wnt)/beta-catenin pathway
      induced during osteoblast differentiation, was suppressed. CONCLUSIONS: In the
      aorta of uremic rats, medial smooth muscle cells acquire a chondrocyte rather
      than osteoblast phenotype during the calcification process.

TI  - Carotid artery calcification and atherosclerosis at the initiation of
      hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 360-9
AB  - AIMS: Vascular calcification and atherosclerosis frequently develop in end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD). Although several reports have investigated both carotid
      artery calcification (CAAC) and carotid atherosclerosis in ESRD patients, the
      relationship between the two vascular conditions has remained unclear. The aim of
      this study was to assess the prevalence of CAAC and carotid artery plaque (CAP)
      in patients with ESRD and to investigate potential factors contributing to the
      development of CAAC and CAP. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This cross-sectional study
      assessed CAAC and CAP using multidetector computed tomography and high-resolution
      B-mode ultrasonography, respectively, in 135 patients with ESRD at the start of
      hemodialysis. The prevalence of CAAC and CAP was examined. The risk factors
      associated with CAAC and CAP were also evaluated using a logistic regression
      model. RESULTS: CAAC and CAP were found in 71% and 65%, of the patients,
      respectively. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and gender showed
      that CAAC was significantly associated with age, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
      serum albumin, calcium-phosphorus product, proteinuria and CAP. In contrast, in
      the same analysis, CAP was significantly correlated with age, male gender,
      diabetes, intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria and CAAC. In the multivariate
      analysis, CAAC was independently associated with age, hypertension, and
      calcium-phosphorus product. Male gender was identified as an independent
      determinant for CAP. Furthermore, CAP remained as an independent risk factor of
      CAAC (odds ratio (OR): 13.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.08-47.29), and CAAC
      also showed a high OR for having CAP (OR: 11.74; 95% CI: 4.12-33.51). CONCLUSION:
      Both CAAC and CAP were associated with traditional and/or non-traditional risk
      factors. The risk factors of CAAC were different from those of CAP. CAAC or CAP
      was identified to be an independent risk factor for each other with a high OR,
      thus suggesting a strong relationship between carotid calcification and
      atherosclerosis.

TI  - Relation between intracranial artery calcifications and aortic atherosclerosis in
      ischemic stroke patients.
PG  - 1338-43
LID - 10.1007/s00415-010-5528-1 [doi]
AB  - We previously demonstrated a strong relation between carotid atherosclerosis
      (defined as carotid artery stenosis > or =50%) and intracranial artery
      calcification (IAC) in ischemic stroke patients. The purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the relation between aortic atherosclerosis and IAC. Four hundred
      fifty-four patients with ischemic stroke were included. Complex aortic plaques
      (CAP) were assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and defined as
      plaques > or =4 mm thick or with mobile components in the proximal aorta. IAC
      were assessed in the seven major cerebral arteries and a semiquantitative score
      system was applied, ranging from 0 (no calcification) to 7. Forty-two patients
      (9.3%) had CAP. Patients with CAP were older compared with patients without CAP
      (73.6 vs. 63.6 years, p < 0.001), had more vascular risk factors, more
      significant carotid artery atherosclerosis (p < 0.001), more chronic kidney
      disease (p < 0.001), and a higher IAC score (3.0 vs. 1.8; p < 0.001). Stepwise
      logistic regression selected the following independent factors for CAP: previous 
      stroke or TIA (OR 3.3; 95%CI 1.5-7.0; p = 0.002), carotid artery stenosis > or
      =50% (OR 3.7; 95%CI 1.7-8.0; p = 0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR 3.8; 95%CI
      1.9-7.8; p < 0.001), and IAC score (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.2-1.9; p = 0.002). IAC was
      present in 100% of patients with CAP. Moreover, IAC had a high sensitivity (100%)
      and negative predictive value (100%) for the presence of CAP. In ischemic stroke 
      patients, the absence of IAC strongly points to the lack of CAP. However, these
      results warrant confirmation in prospective studies before concluding the
      non-utility of the use of TEE to exclude CAP as a potential source of cerebral
      embolism in patients without IAC.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification and mortality in diabetic patients with
      proteinuria.
PG  - 1107-14
LID - 10.1038/ki.2010.70 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality
      risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though
      common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no
      studies on the prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early 
      stage type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225
      proteinuric diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a median urine
      protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification, measured by
      electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the
      severity of which correlated with older age, male gender, and white ethnicity.
      However, no association was found between eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus,
      parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39
      months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the severity of
      calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on both
      univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of
      calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the
      severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney
      disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies
      need to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery
      calcification in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.

TI  - Usefulness of rotational atherectomy for the implantation of drug-eluting stents 
      in the calcified lesions of hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 232-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jjcc.2009.11.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting stents (DES) have significantly reduced in-stent
      restenosis. But the calcification of coronary artery lesions in hemodialysis
      patients is a high-risk factor for restenosis after DES implantation. We
      hypothesized that percutaneous transluminal coronary rotational atherectomy
      (PTCRA) may be useful in the prevention of underexpansion and fracture of the
      stents, thereby reducing major adverse cardiac events. METHODS: We
      retrospectively compared the primary success and mid-term outcomes (major adverse
      cardiac events within 12 months) of hemodialysis patients with calcified coronary
      lesions undergoing DES implantation using PTCRA (n=26) with those where DES was
      implanted without PTCRA (n=28). RESULTS: The rates of target lesion
      revascularization in the PTCRA group were lower than those in the non-PTCRA group
      (11.5% vs 35.7%, p=0.026). The rates of restenosis and subacute thrombosis in the
      PTCRA group were modestly lower than those in the non-PTCRA group (restenosis
      rate, 17.4% vs 17.4%, p=0.061; subacute thrombosis rate, 0% vs 7.1%, p=0.31).
      CONCLUSION: PTCRA may be useful for improving the mid-term outcome of DES
      implantation in hemodialysis patients with calcified lesions.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification and coronary flow velocity in haemodialysis
      patients.
PG  - 2685-90
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfq113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decreased coronary flow reserve (CFR) is a marker of endothelial
      dysfunction, coronary artery calcification and inflammation, well-known
      cardiovascular risk factors in haemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we
      aimed to investigate the correlation of coronary artery calcification scores
      (CACS) with CFR in HD patients. METHODS: Sixty-four end-stage renal failure
      patients were enrolled in this study (38 males, 26 females). Thirty-nine healthy 
      subjects (22 males, 17 females) were included in the control group. Biochemical
      parameters and acute-phase inflammation marker [high-sensitivity C-reactive
      protein (hs-CRP)] of patients were recorded before dialysis. The CACS were
      measured by electron beam computerized tomography method. CFR recordings were
      performed by trans-thoracic Doppler echocardiography. The relationship between
      CACS and CFR was evaluated. RESULTS: The mean CACS was 281 +/- 589 and 29
      patients had CACS < 10. Patients with CACS > 10 had significantly lower CFR
      values compared to patients with CACS < 10 (1.56 +/- 0.38 vs 1.84 +/- 0.53, P =
      0.024). However, there was no difference in hs-CRP values between the groups. CFR
      was negatively correlated with CACS (r = -0.276, P = 0.030). In multiple stepwise
      regression analysis, CACS was found to be an independent variable for predicting 
      CFR (P = 0.048). During a follow-up of 18 months, 10 patients had experience of
      cardiovascular events. Patients with CACS > 10 had significantly higher event
      rate [34.5% (10/29) vs 0% (0/24)] compared to those with CACS < 10 (P = 0.001).
      Patients who developed cardiovascular events had significantly higher mean CACS
      and lower CFR values than the remaining group (P = 0.019 and P = 0.039). All of
      four patients who died during follow-up were in the CFR < 2 and CACS > 10 groups.
      CONCLUSIONS: CACS was associated with CFR in HD patients. However, we did not
      find any association of inflammation with CACS and CFR. This association between 
      CFR and CACS might indicate two different (anatomical and functional) aspects of 
      the common pathophysiology of the arterial system in HD patients.

AB  - Hypertension is very common in dialysis patients. Disorders of mineral metabolism
      have been linked to vascular calcification and hypertension in dialysis.
      Fifty-four hemodialysis patients were included in a cross-sectional study in a
      dialysis unit during a 6-month period. Linear regression analysis was done
      between averages of calcium and phosphorus (ca x ph) product and blood pressures 
      (BPs). Ca x ph was significantly associated with systolic BP predialysis (P=.03, 
      R=0.28), diastolic BP predialysis (P=.001, R=0.44), predialysis mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) (P=.002, R=0.4), and diastolic BP postdialysis (P=.03, R=0.26). No
      relationship was found with pulse pressures. Multilinear regression analysis was 
      then done between ca x ph product and BPs adjusting for age, sex, hemoglobin,
      diabetes, albumin, parathyroid hormone, ultrafiltration volume, and average BP
      medications per patient. There was a strong positive association with predialysis
      systolic BP (P=.003, R(2)=0.49), predialysis MAP (P=.001, R(2)=0.51), and
      postdialysis MAP (P=.02, R(2)=0.65). No associations with pulse pressures were
      detected. The study findings suggest that ca x ph product is significantly
      associated with dialysis MAP and not pulse pressure. This is likely secondary to 
      the stronger relationship with diastolic BP than with systolic BP. Prospective
      studies looking into the associated hemodynamic parameters related to arterial
      stiffness and endothelial dysfunction along with measures for calcifications
      would be very beneficial.

TI  - Study design and subject baseline characteristics in the ADVANCE Study: effects
      of cinacalcet on vascular calcification in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1916-23
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp762 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ADVANCE (A Randomized Study to Evaluate the Effects of Cinacalcet
      plus Low-Dose Vitamin D on Vascular Calcification in Subjects with Chronic Kidney
      Disease Receiving Haemodialysis) Study objective is to assess the effect of
      cinacalcet plus low-dose active vitamin D versus flexible dosing of active
      vitamin D on progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in haemodialysis 
      patients. We report the ADVANCE Study design and baseline subject
      characteristics. METHODS: ADVANCE is a multinational, multicentre, randomized,
      open-label study. Adult haemodialysis patients with moderate to severe secondary 
      hyperparathyroidism (intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] >300 pg/mL or bio-intact
      PTH >160 pg/mL) and baseline CAC score >or=30 were stratified by CAC score
      (>or=30-399, >or=400-999, >or=1000) and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to cinacalcet
      (30-180 mg/day) plus low-dose active vitamin D (cinacalcet group) or flexible
      dosing of active vitamin D alone (control). The study had three phases:
      screening, 20-week dose titration and 32-week follow-up. CAC scores obtained by
      cardiac computed tomography were determined at screening and weeks 28 and 52. The
      primary end point was percentage change in CAC score from baseline to Week 52.
      RESULTS: Subjects (n = 360) were randomized to cinacalcet or control. Mean age
      was 61.5 years, 43% were women, and median dialysis vintage was 36.7 months
      (range, 2.7-351.5 months). The baseline geometric mean CAC score by the Agatston 
      method was 548.7 (95% confidence interval, 480.5-626.6). Baseline CAC score was
      independently associated with age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes and iPTH.
      Subjects also had extensive aortic and valvular calcification at baseline.
      CONCLUSIONS: Subjects enrolled in ADVANCE have extensive CAC at baseline. The
      ADVANCE Study should help determine whether cinacalcet attenuates progression of 
      vascular calcification.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Angiography remains a critical component for diagnostic imaging and
      therapeutic intervention in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The goal of this
      study was to compare angiography with corresponding intravascular ultrasound
      (IVUS) imaging of the same vessels in patients with PAD. METHODS: From 2004 to
      2008, 93 patients undergoing angiography for PAD were recruited in a prospective 
      observational analysis. At the time of angiography, diseased lower extremities
      were interrogated using a 10-cm IVUS pullback with registration points. IVUS data
      were analyzed with radiofrequency techniques for vessel and lumen diameter,
      plaque volume, plaque composition, and cross-sectional area. Similarly, three
      vascular surgeons blinded to the IVUS data graded corresponding angiographic
      images according to vessel diameter, degree of stenosis, degree of calcification,
      and extent of eccentricity. Statistical analyses of matched IVUS images and
      angiograms were performed. RESULTS: The distribution of demographic and risk
      variables were typical for PAD: 54% male, 96% hypertension, 78% hyperlipidemia,
      44% diabetic, 87% tobacco history, 65% coronary artery disease, and 10% end-stage
      renal disease. Symptoms precipitating the angiographic evaluation included
      claudication (53%), rest pain (18%), and tissue loss (29%). Angiographic and IVUS
      interpretation were similar for luminal diameters, but external vessel diameter
      was greater by IVUS imaging (7.0 +/- 0.7 vs 5.2 +/- 0.8 mm, P < .05). The
      two-dimensional diameter method resulted in a significant correlation for
      stenosis determination (r = 0.84); however, IVUS determination of vessel area
      stenosis was greater by 10% (95% confidence interval, 0.3%-21%, P < .05). IVUS
      imaging indicated that a higher proportion of plaques were concentric. Grading of
      calcification was moderate to severe in 40% by angiography but in only 7% by IVUS
      (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In the evaluation of PAD, angiography and IVUS imaging
      provide similar luminal diameters and diameter-reducing stenosis measurements.
      Determination of overall vessel diameter and interpretation of plaque morphology 
      by angiography are discordant from IVUS-derived data.

TI  - Pulse wave velocity and vascular calcification at different stages of chronic
      kidney disease.
PG  - 163-9
LID - 10.1097/HJH.0b013e328331b81e [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased arterial stiffness and vascular calcification have been
      recognized as important predictors of cardiovascular mortality in patients with
      chronic kidney disease. METHOD: In order to examine the precise temporal link
      between aortic stiffness and cardiovascular risk at the earliest stages of
      chronic kidney disease, we studied a cohort of 150 patients with chronic kidney
      disease (52 stage 2/3 patients, 51 stage 4/5 patients and 47 stage 5D patients). 
      Each patient underwent a plain, lateral lumbar radiograph and an abdominal and
      thoracic multislice spiral computer tomography scan in order to identify and
      quantify aortic and coronary calcifications. Pulse wave velocity was used as a
      measure of arterial stiffness. RESULTS: Regardless of the disease stage, patients
      with chronic kidney disease had higher adjusted pulse wave velocity than controls
      with preserved renal function (14.6 +/- 3.8 vs. 10.7 +/- 1.7 m/s, respectively; P
      < 0.0001). Regarding aortic calcification, there was a gradual but significant
      rise in later chronic kidney disease stages. A similar trend was found for
      coronary calcification. In a multivariate analysis only age, mean arterial
      pressure, diabetes and the aortic calcification score were independent
      determinants of higher pulse wave velocity. CONCLUSION: We found that both
      vascular stiffness and vascular calcification appear early in patients with
      chronic kidney disease, but only vascular calcification worsens as the disease
      progresses. The increase of vascular stiffness in adult patients with chronic
      kidney disease seems to be more related to age, systolic blood pressure, diabetes
      and vascular calcification than to uremic toxicity.

TI  - Arterial stiffness in dialysis patients: where are we now?
PG  - 741-52
LID - 10.1007/s11255-009-9675-1 [doi]
AB  - Patients with end-stage renal disease treated by chronic dialysis have an
      impressive mortality, which more than half of this mortality is attributable to
      cardiovascular disease. Despite stratification for sex, race, and the presence of
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease mortality is 10-30 times higher in dialysis
      patients compared to general population. In dialysis patients, both
      atherosclerosis (mainly affecting the intima of the arteries) and
      arteriosclerosis (affecting predominantly the media of large- and middle-sized
      arteries diffusely) are highly prominent. Arteriosclerosis characterized by
      reduced arterial compliance (i.e., reduced elasticity of the arteries) is due to 
      increased fibrosis, loss of elastic fibers, and extensive vessel wall
      calcification. Arteriosclerosis is closely related to arterial stiffness. A
      generally accepted mechanistic view is that an increase in arterial stiffness
      causes a premature return of reflected waves in late systole, increasing central 
      pulse pressure, thus systolic. An increased arterial stiffness can increase the
      risk of stroke through several mechanisms, including an increase in central pulse
      pressure, influencing arterial remodeling both at the site of the extracranial
      and intracranial arteries, increasing carotid wall thickness, and the development
      of stenosis and plaques, and the likelihood of plaque rupture. Very importantly, 
      it was also suggested that arterial stiffness itself independently plays a role
      in exacerbating chronic kidney disease progression. This review deals briefly
      with the definition of arterial stiffness, methods of measuring arterial
      stiffness and pathophysiology of arterial stiffness, and factors related with
      arterial stiffness.

TI  - Carotid plaque composition in chronic kidney disease: a retrospective analysis of
      patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
PG  - 11-6
LID - 10.1016/j.ejvs.2009.09.024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Calcified plaques are suggested to represent atherosclerotic lesions 
      with stabilising properties. However, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      frequently have calcified plaques but significant higher prevalence of
      cardiovascular complications. The aim of our study was therefore to analyse the
      effect of CKD in patients with advanced carotid stenosis (>70%) on plaque
      composition, lesion stability and risk of rupture. METHODS: We investigated
      retrospectively, by histology, carotid plaques of patients with high-grade
      internal carotid artery stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Comparison of
      plaque morphology was performed on 41 patients with CKD with estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml min(-1) (according to the Modification of Diet in
      Renal Disease formula, MDRD-eGFR) and 56 patients with normal renal function.
      RESULTS: Patients with CKD had significantly higher percentage of total
      calcification (17% vs. 7%, p<0.001), unstable and ruptured plaques (83% vs. 52%, 
      p=0.001 and 59% vs. 36%, p=0.039, respectively) compared with patients with
      normal renal function. By contrast, the content of collagenous fibres was
      significantly reduced in CKD patients (40% vs. 57%, p=0.011). No significant
      differences were found for neurological symptoms and soft plaque content.
      CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that CKD significantly affects plaque
      composition in patients with advanced carotid artery stenosis. Enhanced
      calcification and reduced collagenous plaque may lead to plaque instability and
      rupture.

TI  - Fibroblast growth factor 23 and matrix-metalloproteinases in patients with
      chronic kidney disease: are they associated with cardiovascular disease?
PG  - 276-83
LID - 10.1159/000243050 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) may be related to mineral disorder and microinflammation. Fibroblast growth
      factor 23 (FGF-23) is a phosphatonin and inhibitor of calcitriol synthesis, which
      is associated with poor prognosis in CKD patients starting dialysis.
      Matrix-metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-9) contribute to myocardial remodeling and 
      arterial calcification. FGF-23 and MMPs levels are altered in CKD, however,
      little is known about their association and relation to cardiovascular (CV)
      disease. METHODS: Standard laboratory parameters, plasma levels of MMP-2, MMP-9, 
      FGF-23, PAPP-A and CV disease history were assessed in 80 patients with CKD 1-5
      and 44 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: FGF-23 and MMP-2 (assessed by ELISA)
      were higher in CKD patients compared to controls. FGF-23 increased from CKD 3,
      whereas MMP-2 increased only in CKD 5. FGF-23 was positively associated with
      MMP-2, adjusted to age, eGFR, phosphatemia, calcitriol and parathormone. FGF-23
      independently correlated with parathormone and inversely with calcitriol, whereas
      MMP-2 was related to phosphatemia. FGF-23 was higher in subjects with a history
      of CV disease compared to those free of such history (559.0 vs.184.0 RU/ml),
      adjusted to age and eGFR. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a possible relationship
      between FGF-23, MMP-2 and CV disease in CKD. Potential causality of this
      association remains to be elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and cardiovascular events are common in
      hemodialysis patients. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)
      plays an important role in vascular calcification and bone remodeling. This study
      investigates the effects of soluble RANKL (sRANKL) on cardiovascular events in
      hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Serum sRANKL levels of 47 patients were tested by
      ELISA. Vascular calcification was radiographically measured and patients were
      followed up for 2 years. RESULTS: After 2 years, 10 (36.6%) patients had
      experienced cardiovascular events. Seventy-five percent (6/9) of mortality was
      due to cardiovascular disease. Patients experiencing cardiovascular events showed
      significantly higher vascular calcification scores (VCS) (3.20 +/- 2.74 vs. 1.19 
      +/- 1.60; t = 2.999; p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that
      serum sRANKL levels, vascular calcification scores and phosphorus were
      independent determinants of cardiovascular events. CONCLUSION: Serum sRANKL
      levels and VCS are independent risk factors, and hemodialysis patients with low
      serum sRANKL levels have a risk of cardiovascular events.

TI  - Serum indoxyl sulfate is associated with vascular disease and mortality in
      chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 1551-8
LID - 10.2215/CJN.03980609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As a major component of uremic syndrome,
      cardiovascular disease is largely responsible for the high mortality observed in 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD). Preclinical studies have evidenced an association
      between serum levels of indoxyl sulfate (IS, a protein-bound uremic toxin) and
      vascular alterations. The aim of this study is to investigate the association
      between serum IS, vascular calcification, vascular stiffness, and mortality in a 
      cohort of CKD patients. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS:
      One-hundred and thirty-nine patients (mean +/- SD age: 67 +/- 12; 60% male) at
      different stages of CKD (8% at stage 2, 26.5% at stage 3, 26.5% at stage 4, 7% at
      stage 5, and 32% at stage 5D) were enrolled. RESULTS: Baseline IS levels
      presented an inverse relationship with renal function and a direct relationship
      with aortic calcification and pulse wave velocity. During the follow-up period
      (605 +/- 217 d), 25 patients died, mostly because of cardiovascular events (n =
      18). In crude survival analyses, the highest IS tertile was a powerful predictor 
      of overall and cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.001 and 0.012, respectively). The 
      predictive power of IS for death was maintained after adjustment for age, gender,
      diabetes, albumin, hemoglobin, phosphate, and aortic calcification. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study presented here indicates that IS may have a significant role in the
      vascular disease and higher mortality observed in CKD patients.

TI  - Association among serum fetuin-A level, coronary artery calcification, and bone
      mineral densitometry in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 844-54
LID - 10.1111/j.1525-1594.2009.00814.x [doi]
AB  - Patients with end-stage renal disease have a very high prevalence and extent of
      arterial calcification. A number of studies suggest that similar pathophysiologic
      mechanisms are responsible for development and progression of calcification of
      atherosclerotic plaque and bone formation. Fetuin-A is a potent calcification
      inhibitor and is expressed in bone, with not-yet well-defined functions. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate the relation between bone mineral densitometry
      parameters, coronary artery calcification, and serum fetuin-A levels. In a
      cross-sectional design, we included 72 maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients and
      30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Serum fetuin-A levels were studied
      both in maintenance HD patients and healthy controls. Maintenance HD patients had
      radius, hip, and lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual-energy 
      X-ray absorptiometry and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) measured by
      electron-beam computed tomography. The associations between site-specific BMD
      parameters, CACS, and serum fetuin-A levels were studied in maintenance HD
      patients. CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries were
      significantly higher in patients with a T-score below -2.5 than above in the
      proximal region of the radius, neck and trochanter of the femur, and the lumbar
      spine. Mean serum fetuin-A concentration was 0.636 +/- 0.118 g/L in maintenance
      HD patients and it was less than healthy controls (0.829 +/- 0.100 g/L, P <
      0.0001). CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries correlated
      significantly with the serum fetuin-A levels. Moreover, significant positive
      correlations were shown between the serum fetuin-A levels, BMD values, and
      T-scores of proximal radius, neck, and trochanter of the femur, but not with the 
      lumbar spine. The present study demonstrates an association between serum
      fetuin-A levels, coronary artery calcification, and bone mineral
      densities--except for the lumbar spine, in maintenance HD patients. However, the 
      results should be interpreted with caution because of the cross-sectional design 
      of the study.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 exacerbate arterial stiffening and angiogenesis
      in diabetes and chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 494-504
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvp242 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes are the prominent risk factors of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 regulate
      vascular structure by degrading elastic fibre and inhibit angiogenesis by
      generating angiostatin. We hypothesized that MMP-2 and -9 were up-regulated in
      the arterial vasculature from CKD patients with diabetes, compared with those
      without diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: During living donor transplantation
      procedures, arteries from donors (n = 8) and recipients (non-diabetic, n = 8;
      diabetic, n = 8; matched in age, gender, and dialysis treatments) were harvested.
      Diabetic arteries had increased MMP-2 and -9 activities by 42 and 116% compared
      with non-diabetic ones. Diabetic arteries were the stiffest, and the stiffness
      measurement was highly correlated with the summation of MMP-2 + MMP-9 activities 
      (r = 0.738, P = 0.0002). Pulse wave velocity measurements correlated with MMP
      activity (r = 0.683, P = 0.005). Elastic fibre degradation and calcification were
      worst in diabetic vessels. The phosphate level, which was 25% higher in diabetic 
      patients, correlated with MMP activity (r = 0.513, P = 0.04) and in vitro
      stiffness (r = 0.545, P = 0.03), respectively. Angiostatin expression was
      doubled, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor was 50% reduced in diabetic
      compared with non-diabetic vessels. Microvascular density in diabetic vessels was
      48% of that in non-diabetic ones, and it was strongly associated with MMP
      activity (r = -0.792, P < 0.0001) and vasorelaxation (r = 0.685, P = 0.0009).
      CONCLUSION: Using a matched case-control design, we report up-regulation of MMP-2
      and -9 in diabetic CKD arteries and correlate those with stiffening, impaired
      angiogenesis, and endothelial dysfunction. These findings may help to explain the
      high susceptibility of CVD in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD patients.

TI  - Coronary calcification is associated with lower bone formation rate in CKD
      patients not yet in dialysis treatment.
PG  - 499-504
LID - 10.1359/jbmr.090735 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is a strong prognostic marker of mortality in hemodialysis
      patients and has been associated with bone metabolism disorders in this
      population. In earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD), vascular
      calcification also has been documented. This study evaluated the association
      between coronary artery calcification (CAC) and bone histomorphometric parameters
      in CKD predialysis patients assessed by multislice coronary tomography and by
      undecalcified bone biopsy. CAC was detected in 33 (66%) patients, and their
      median calcium score was 89.7 (0.4-2299.3 AU). The most frequent bone histologic 
      alterations observed included low trabecular bone volume, increased eroded and
      osteoclast surfaces, and low bone-formation rate (BFR/BS). Multiple logistic
      regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes, showed that BFR/BS was 
      independently associated with the presence of coronary calcification [p = .009;
      odd ratio (OR) = 0.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.036-0.619]. This study
      showed a high prevalence of CAC in asymptomatic predialysis CKD patients. Also,
      there was an independent association of low bone formation and CAC in this
      population. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that low bone-formation
      rate constitutes another nontraditional risk factor for cardiovascular disease in
      CKD patients.

TI  - Correlation between plasma osteopontin levels and aortic valve calcification:
      potential insights into the pathogenesis of aortic valve calcification and
      stenosis.
PG  - 196-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jtcvs.2008.10.045 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The inflammatory process of aortic stenosis involves the
      differentiation of aortic valve myofibroblasts into osteoblasts. Osteopontin, a
      proinflammatory glycoprotein, both stimulates differentiation of myofibroblasts
      and regulates the deposition of calcium by osteoblasts. Osteopontin levels are
      increased in patients with such conditions as end-stage renal disease, ectopic
      calcification, and autoimmune disease. We hypothesized that increased plasma
      osteopontin levels might be associated with the presence of aortic valve
      calcification and stenosis. METHODS: Venous blood from volunteers older than 65
      years undergoing routine echocardiographic analysis or aortic valve surgery for
      aortic stenosis was collected. Plasma osteopontin levels were measured by means
      of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The presence of aortic stenosis was defined
      as an aortic valve area of less than 2.0 cm(2). Aortic valve calcification was
      assessed by using a validated echocardiographic grading system (1, none; 2, mild;
      3, moderate; 4, severe). Comparisons were performed with nonpaired t tests.
      RESULTS: Aortic stenosis was present in 23 patients (mean age, 78 years) and was 
      absent in 7 patients (mean age, 72 years). Aortic valve calcification scores were
      3.5 +/- 0.6 and 1.3 +/- 0.5 in patients with and without aortic stenosis,
      respectively (P < .001). Patients with no or mild aortic valve calcification had 
      lower osteopontin levels compared with patients with moderate or severe aortic
      valve calcification (406.1 +/- 165.8 vs 629.5 +/- 227.5 ng/mL, P = .01).
      Similarly, patients with aortic stenosis had higher osteopontin levels compared
      with patients without aortic stenosis (652.2 +/- 218.7 vs 379.7 +/- 159.9 ng/mL, 
      P < .01). CONCLUSION: Increased levels of plasma osteopontin are associated with 
      the presence of aortic valve calcification and stenosis. These findings suggest
      that osteopontin might play a functional role in the pathogenesis of calcific
      aortic stenosis.

TI  - A cut-off value of plasma osteoprotegerin level may predict the presence of
      coronary artery calcifications in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 3389-97
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp301 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expression of bone proteins resulting from transdifferentiation of
      vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblasts suggests that vascular
      calcifications are a bioactive process. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) could play a key
      role in bone-vascular calcification imbalance and could be a marker of vascular
      calcification extent and progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
      relationships between vascular risk biomarkers (including classic risk factors
      and OPG) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) extent in chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) patients and to establish within the markers the appropriate cut-off value 
      to predict CAC. METHODS: A total of 133 non-dialyzed CKD patients at various
      stages of kidney disease [75 males/58 females, median age: 69.9 (27.4-94.6)] were
      enrolled, excluding extrarenal replacement therapy patients. All underwent chest 
      multidetector computed tomography for CAC scoring. Blood samples were collected
      for measurement of vascular risk markers (kidney disease, inflammation,
      nutrition, calcium phosphate and OPG). A potential relationship between CAC and
      these biological markers was investigated, and a receiver-operating
      characteristic (ROC) curve was designed thereafter to identify a cut-off value of
      involved markers that best predicted the presence of CAC. RESULTS: After
      adjustment for age, diabetes, smoking and gender, among biological markers, only 
      low-estimated glomerular filtration rate using Modification of Diet in Renal
      Disease [OR = 3.63 (1.10-12.02)], high FEPO(4) [OR = 3.99 (1.17-13.6)] and high
      OPG levels [OR = 8.54 (2.14-34.11)] were associated with the presence of CAC. A
      protective effect of 1.25(OH)(2) vitamin D [OR = 0.20 (0.05-0.79)] and LDL
      cholesterol [OR = 0.27 (0.08-0.94)] on CAC was also observed. ROC curve analysis 
      showed that the OPG best cut-off value predicting CAC was 757.7 pg/mL.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a CAC increase is strongly associated with
      a plasma OPG increase in CKD patients. The values of OPG >757.7 pg/mL allow us to
      predict the presence of CAC in these patients.

TI  - [Prevalence and functional effect of arteriovenous fistula calcifications,
      evaluated by spiral CT in chronic haemodialysis patients].
PG  - 214-21

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification is a common finding in patients (pts) with
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-sectional study 
      was to investigate the prevalence and functional effect of native arteriovenous
      fistula AVF (feeding artery and/or arterialized vein) calcifications evaluated by
      spiral computed tomography (CT) in ESRD pts undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD).
      PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty-five upper limb AVF (radial 44.4% or brachial 55.6%,
      mean duration 65.3 +/- 80.9 months) without evidence of significant stenosis were
      evaluated by CT in 45 ESRD pts (mean age 63.8 +/- 13.1 yr; sex M: 71.1%, F:
      28.9%; mean time on HD 53.1 +/- 51.9 months; diabetic nephropathy 15.6%). All AVF
      explorations were performed using the same multi-slice spiral CT scanner (HiSpeed
      Dual machine, GE Medical Systems). The severity of AVF calcifications was
      quantified by CT using the following criteria: grade I absence of calcifications,
      grade II isolated calcifications (<10 groups of calcification), grade III
      moderate calcifications (10-20 groups of calcification) and grade IV diffuse
      calcifications (>20 groups of calcification). Laboratory parameters analyzed:
      calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone; calcium x phosphorus product was
      calculated. The same week of CT scanning, we evaluated AVF function measuring the
      blood flow rate (QA). We determined QA (1559.3 +/- 980.6 ml/min) by the Delta-H
      method (ABF-mode, HemaMetrics, USA) using the Crit-Line III monitor (68.9%) or by
      Doppler ultrasound (31.1%) performed by the same radiologist using a 5-8 MHz
      linear transducer (Sequoia machine, Siemens-Acuson); mean arterial pressure MAP
      (94.7 +/- 16.3 mmHg) was recorded simultaneous with QA. RESULTS: Most pts not
      showed AVF calcification by CT scan (grade I: 27/45, 60%). Forty percent of pts
      (18/45) demonstrated any degree of AVF calcification (grade II 13.3%, grade III
      8.9%, grade IV 17.8%). Pts with brachial AVF showed higher mean QA compared to
      pts with radial AVF (1899.1 +/- 1131.8 versus 1134.5 +/- 516.4 ml/min, p=0.005), 
      but MAP (91.2 +/- 15.8 versus 99.0 +/- 16.2 mmHg) and the prevalence of AVF
      calcification (32% versus 50%) were not different between both groups (p=0.11 and
      p=0.24, respectively). Pts with evidence of any calcification on CT scanning
      (grade II, III or IV) had higher time on HD (84.6 +/- 63.1 versus 24.6 +/- 20.0
      months), higher AVF duration (97.7 +/- 89.3 versus 34.6 +/- 61.2 months) and
      similar QA (1488.3 +/- 678.9 versus 1606.6 +/- 1148.9 ml/min) compared with pts
      without AVF calcification (p=0.014, p=0.001 and p=0.69, respectively); no
      differences in MAP (95.4 +/- 13.8 versus 94.2 +/- 17.9 mmHg), prevalence of
      brachial AVF (44% versus 63%) or mineral metabolism parameters were found when
      comparing both groups (for all comparisons, p=NS). The same results were obtained
      when comparing pts with a high (grade III-IV: 26.7%) and a low (grade I-II:
      73.3%) AVF calcification score, or when comparing pts with diffuse (grade IV) and
      without (grade I) AVF calcification. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The prevalence of AVF
      calcification by CT scan was 40%. 2) The AVF calcification was related with time 
      on HD and AVF duration. 3) The function of fully developed AVF without stenosis
      and suitable for routine HD was not impaired by the presence of calcifications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) population. The mechanisms of vascular damage are not fully 
      understood. The objective of this study was to prospectively investigate the
      importance of novel mediators of vascular damage, in conjunction with vascular
      calcification (VC), on survival. METHODS: A total of 134 subjects [60
      haemodialysis (HD), 28 peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 46 CKD stage 4] were studied.
      All survivors completed 40 months of follow-up. VC was measured using multi-slice
      spiral CT of the superficial femoral artery. Circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG),
      Fetuin-A and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured in
      addition to standard clinical biochemical analysis. RESULTS: After a 40-month
      follow-up, 31 patients had died (27 men and 4 women). Of 31 subjects, 31 had
      evidence of significant VC. The majority of deaths were in the HD group (48%),
      36% were PD subjects and 16% were CKD subjects. The outcome of interest was
      survival at the end of follow-up. Multivariate logistical regression analysis
      revealed male gender [OR 8.06 (1.34-48.450) P = 0.02], OPG >25 pmol/L [OR
      5.31(1.35-20.88) P = 0.02] and hypoalbuminaemia [OR 0.26 (0.12-0.56) P < 0.01],
      were associated with increased odds of death. CONCLUSION: We have previously
      reported that VC and low albumin predict death in CKD stages 4 and 5 over a
      2-year follow-up period. These data show that OPG, independent of CRP, is also
      associated with a negative outcome. The mechanisms remain to be elucidated;
      however, it is likely that they are associated with vascular damage through
      mechanisms in addition to VC.

PG  - 1128-35
LID - 10.2215/CJN.00260109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality 
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vitamin D might have beneficial effects
      on vascular health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of
      vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25D] <or= 15 ng/ml) and insufficiency 
      (25D levels between 16 and 30 ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at different CKD
      stages and the relationships between vitamin D serum levels, vascular
      calcification and stiffness, and the mortality risk. DESIGN, SETTING,
      PARTICIPANTS & MEASUREMENTS: One hundred forty CKD patients (85 men, mean age 67 
      +/- 12 yr; CKD stages 2 [8%], 3 [26%], 4 [26%], 5 [7%], and 5D [(33%]) were
      allocated for a prospective study. Serum levels of 25D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
      D, aortic calcification score, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were evaluated.
      RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42%) and
      insufficiency (34%). Patients with 25D <or= 16.7 ng/ml (median) had a
      significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D >16.7 ng/ml (mean
      follow-up, 605 +/- 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05). Multivariate adjustments
      (included age, gender, diabetes, arterial pressure, CKD stage, phosphate,
      albumin, hemoglobin, aortic calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as
      an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D
      deficiency and insufficiency were highly prevalent in this CKD cohort. Low 25D
      levels affected mortality independently of vascular calcification and stiffness, 
      suggesting that 25D may influence survival in CKD patients via additional
      pathways that need to be further explored.

TI  - The influence of dialysate calcium on progression of arterial stiffness in
      peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - S15-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the origins of cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients is 
      arterial stiffness. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship between
      the calcium content of peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution and arterial stiffness. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled into the study 49 PD patients who had been
      treated with the same PD solution for the preceding 6 months. The calcium content
      of the PD solution was 1.25 mmol/L in 34 patients (low-Ca group) and 1.75 mmol/L 
      in 15 patients (high-Ca group). Study patients were followed for 6 months on the 
      same PD prescription. Arterial stiffness was assessed by measurement of
      augmentation index (AI) and brachial pulse wave velocity (PWV) at baseline and at
      month 6 (SphygmoCor: Atcor Medical, West Ryde, NSW, Australia). Demographic data 
      were recorded from patient charts. RESULTS: Mean age of the whole group was 51
      +/- 11 years, prevalence of diabetes was 14%, duration of PD was 43 +/- 30
      months, percentage of women was 45%, and percentage of patients using a cycler
      was 33%. We observed no differences between groups with regard to those variables
      or creatinine clearance, residual renal function, Ca, phosphorus, parathormone,
      C-reactive protein, lipid parameters, and use of phosphate binder with or without
      Ca content. Mean arterial pressure was higher in the high-Ca group, but the
      difference was not statistically significant (100 +/- 22 mmHg vs 88 +/- 18 mmHg, 
      p = 0.06). At baseline, AI was significantly higher in the high-Ca group than in 
      the low-Ca group (27% +/- 10% vs 21% +/- 9%, p < 0.05). Measurements of PWV were 
      not different between the groups (8.4 +/- 1.1 m/s vs 8.5 +/- 1.7 m/s).
      Measurement of arterial stiffness parameters at month 6 revealed that PWV had
      increased in the high-Ca group (to 9.6 +/- 2.3 m/s from 8.4 +/- 1.1 m/s, p <
      0.05), but had not changed in the low-Ca group (to 8.2 +/- 1.9 m/s from 8.5 +/-
      1.7 m/s). The AI did not change in either group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest 
      that Ca exposure through PD solution plays a role in the progression of arterial 
      stiffness, which may be related to increased vascular calcification.

TI  - How long is the warranty period for nil or low coronary artery calcium in
      patients new to hemodialysis?
PG  - 255-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is common in patients with
      advanced chronic kidney disease on dialysis. A sizeable proportion of patients
      has no or minimal CAC at the inception of dialysis, but it is unclear how long
      they remain free of it. METHODS: For the purpose of this study, 36 incident
      hemodialysis patients were submitted to sequential chest computed tomography to
      quantify CAC at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 30 months. RESULTS: Among them, 15 had
      absent or minimal CAC score (CACS 0 to 30) and 21 had a CACS>30 at baseline.
      Overall, the median baseline CACS was 129 (interquartile range [IQR]=0-709) and
      it increased to 364 (IQR=8.3-1683) at study completion (182% increase). Among the
      15 patients with minimal CACS, only 3 progressed and the median CACS increase was
      20, as opposed to 15 of 21 patients with a baseline CACS>30 whose median
      progression was 431 (p<0.02). The 18 patients who had CACS progression were older
      (68.5 vs. 57.3 years, p=0.0081) and exhibited a poorer control of mineral
      metabolism (phosphorus 5.2 vs. 4.9 mg/ dL, p=0.048; corrected calcium x
      phosphorus product [CaxP] 49.3 vs. 46.2 mg2/dL2, p=0.001) than the patients
      without progression. On multivariable analysis, independent predictors of
      progression were baseline CACS (p=0.038) and time-averaged Cax;P (p=0.077).
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest that absent or low CAC at baseline is associated
      with minimal progression even up to 30 months. Careful management of mineral
      metabolism appears to be one of the main factors that limit progression of CAC.

TI  - Arterial calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 2488-96
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp137 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), aortic calcification is
      more frequent and severe and it is also predictive of adverse cardiovascular
      outcome. The aim of the present study was to characterize aortic calcification in
      renal compared with non-renal patients. METHODS: Aortas of 31 patients with
      advanced CKD and of 31 age-and gender-matched controls were obtained at autopsy. 
      Calcium and phosphorus content in the aorta was quantitated using x-ray analysis.
      The expression of calcification-promoting and calcification-inhibiting proteins
      was assessed using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The calcium and phosphorus
      content of the aorta was higher in CKD patients than in controls. Even in
      non-calcified aortic specimens of CKD, staining for Msx-2, BMP-2, bone
      sialo-protein, TNF-alpha and nitrotyrosine was significantly more marked compared
      to controls. The same proteins were immunodetected in calcified aortic specimens 
      of both CKD and controls. In contrast, staining for transglutaminase-2 and Fetuin
      A was significantly reduced in CKD. Higher expression of cbfa-1 and Pit-1 was
      observed in all calcified aortas with no difference between CKD and controls. The
      expression of TNF-alpha, phospho-p38 and Msx-2 was correlated to the intensity of
      upregulation of BMP-2 and osteoblastic transdifferentiation by VSMC even in
      non-calcified areas of the aortas of CKD. CONCLUSION: The expression of markers
      characteristic for calcification is not different in calcified aorta of CKD
      patients compared to controls, but in CKD patients, evidence of inflammation,
      transformation to an osteoblastic phenotype and reduced expression of
      transglutaminase are also found even in non-calcified aorta.

TI  - Factors associated with various arterial calcifications in haemodialysis
      patients.
PG  - 185-199
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemodialysis (HD) patients are at increased risk of the development 
      of arterial intimal (AIC) and medial calcification (AMC). The aim of our study
      was to analyze the association between the pre-defined potential risk factors and
      the status of various arterial calcifications in our HD patients. METHODS: In a
      cross-sectional study of 150 patients (91 male, mean age 54.55 +/- 12.46 yrs, HD 
      duration 104.77 +/- 68.02 mths) we first determined the presence of AIC and AMC
      using plain radiography of the pelvis. We then compared the percentages of
      different radiogram findings in patients stratified according to various cut-off 
      levels or the codes of each clinical and biochemical parameter (mean value of one
      year laboratory data recorded in the files). RESULTS: We determined arterial
      calcifications in 77.3% of our patients (AIC in 45.3%, AMC in 32%). The
      significantly higher frequencies of arterial calcifications of both groups (AIC
      and/or AMC) and isolated AIC presence were found in patients older than 55 at
      inclusion and 45 at the start of treatment with HD, with a serum C-reactive
      protein (CRP) > 4.5 mg/L, predominantly of male gender with diabetes. The
      patients with a significantly higher occurrence of arterial calcifications had
      lower percentages of total serum calcium (Ca) levels but within the K/DOQI
      guideline recommendations. Also, we found a significantly higher proportion of
      isolated AIC presence in the group of patients with corrected total serum Ca
      levels > 2.35 mmol/L and serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels out of
      the range proposed by K/DOQI guidelines. In parallel, a significantly higher
      percentage of absence of arterial calcifications (ACA) was obtained in the
      patients with corrected total serum Ca levels < 2.35 mmol/L, body mass index
      (BMI) < 23 kg/m(2), mean pulse pressure < 60 mmHg, blood leucocytes < 6.5 x
      10(9)L and serum triglycerides < 1.8 mmol/L. Finally, we found a significantly
      higher presence of isolated AMC in patients with mean Kt/V < 1.3 (poor dialysis
      adequacy), serum triglycerides > 1.8 mmol/L and outside K/DOQI guideline
      achievements for corrected total serum Ca. In the 12 month period data analyzed, 
      there were no significant differences in other risk factors such as the dose of
      prescribed calcium carbonate and vitamin D3, serum levels of albumin,
      cholesterol, phosphate (P) and Ca x P product. CONCLUSIONS: AIC and AMC were
      frequently present in our HD population. Age, gender, BMI, diabetes, pulse
      pressure, dialysis adequacy, serum CRP, triglycerides, Ca and iPTH, as well as
      blood leucocyte levels were associated with the occurrence of arterial
      calcifications in our HD patients.

TI  - Incidental renal artery calcifications: a study of 350 consecutive abdominal
      computed tomography scans.
PG  - 2170-5
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcifications in arteries are thought to represent atherosclerosis. 
      METHODS: Consecutive abdominal tomographic scans performed during a 4-month
      period were evaluated and assessed for renal artery calcifications (RAC). Scans
      that showed calcifications were evaluated for renal artery narrowing and for
      various characteristics of the atherosclerotic plaque. RESULTS: Of 350
      consecutive examinees, 43% were men, 40% had hypertension and 38% had
      hypercholesterolaemia. The age was 61 +/- 13 years. Aortic calcifications were
      found in 54% and RAC in 102 (29%), of whom 53 had bilateral calcifications.
      Subjects with RAC were older, 72 +/- 6 versus 55 +/- 12 years. Adjusted odds
      ratios of RAC were 2.2 (95% CI 1.1-4.6) for male gender, 2.4 (1.2-4.8) for
      hypertension and 2.9 (1.4-5.8) for hypercholesterolaemia, whereas family history 
      of hypertension was protective with 0.5 (0.3-0.9). All patients with calcified
      renal arteries had aortic calcifications, versus 35% of those without RAC. A
      significant correlation was found between the severity of calcifications and the 
      degree of renal artery narrowing (r = 0.7), and also between the presence of
      bilateral calcifications and a high-grade narrowing. CONCLUSIONS: RAC strongly
      relates to atherosclerosis. Calcifications and artery narrowing may have a role
      in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Bilateral calcifications suggest
      atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis.

      polymorphisms are associated with mortality in haemodialysis patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis are major
      causes of death in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 
      are a family of enzymes, involved in the biology of extracellular matrix and in
      atherogenesis. MMP1 and MMP3 contribute to the enlargement and instability of
      atherosclerotic plaque, respectively. The common polymorphisms on MMP1 (2G/2G)
      and MMP3 (6A/6A) gene promoters have been related to increased coronary artery
      calcification and to carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the association of MMP1 and MMP3 polymorphisms with end-stage renal
      failure (ESRD) and all-cause mortality risk in HD. METHODS: Ninety-nine HD
      patients, followed-up for 36 months, and 133 matched controls were genotyped for 
      the two polymorphisms. HD patients' characteristics were age 64 +/- 13 years,
      males 64%, diabetic 24%, hypertensive 62%, smokers 38%, dyslipidaemic 28%, all
      undergoing standard HD thrice weekly. RESULTS: ESRD was strongly associated with 
      the combination of 2G/2G and 6A/6A homozygosity: OR 2.57 (0.95-7.4), P = 0.037,
      but not with isolated 2G/2G and 6A/6A homozygosity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.11,
      respectively). Isolated 2G/2G was associated with all-cause mortality risk
      independently from age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidaemia,
      C-reactive protein, albumin, dialysis vintage and history of cardio-vascular
      disease: HR 2.96 (1.29-6.80), P = 0.01. A trend for the association of mortality 
      and isolated 6A/6A homozygosity was also observed: HR 3.01 (0.88-10.26), P =
      0.078. Combination of 2G/2G and 6A/6A homozygosity significantly increased the
      mortality risk in the same Cox regression model: HR 4.69 (1.72-12.81), P = 0.003.
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that MMP-1 and
      MMP-3 gene polymorphisms are negative prognostic risk factors for all-cause
      mortality in HD patients, independently from traditional risk factors. These data
      may have important implications for better understanding the pathogenesis of the 
      increased mortality in HD patients.

TI  - Association of kidney function and uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein: data from
      the Heart and Soul Study.
PG  - 2095-101
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in persons with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) and predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Matrix Gla
      protein (MGP) is a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification, and lower levels
      of its precursor-uncarboxylated MGP (ucMGP)--are associated with vascular
      calcification and atherosclerosis. Whether mild to moderate decrements in kidney 
      function are associated with lower serum ucMGP is unknown. METHODS: In a
      cross-sectional study among 842 outpatients with stable CVD, estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR), serum cystatin-C and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
      (ACR) were measured and serum ucMGP levels were determined by ELISA. Multivariate
      linear regression evaluated the association of each kidney function measure with 
      serum ucMGP levels. RESULTS: The mean eGFR was 76 +/- 23 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and
      186 subjects (22%) had moderate CKD (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). The mean +/- SD 
      ucMGP level was 3289 +/- 1177 nM. In unadjusted analysis, each 10 mL/ min/1.73
      m(2) lower eGFR was associated with 101 nM lower ucMGP level. This association
      was only minimally attenuated in final multivariate models wherein each 10 mL/
      min/1.73 m(2) lower eGFR was associated with 79 nM lower ucMGP (95% confidence
      interval [CI]; 44 to 115; P < 0.001) after adjustment for age, sex, race, body
      mass index, blood pressure, smoking, hypertension, diabetes; and serum albumin,
      calcium, phosphorus, and fetuin-A levels. Similarly, in models adjusted for
      identical covariates, each 0.1 mg/L higher cystatin-C was associated with 39 nM
      lower ucMGP (95% CI 23 to 55; P < 0.001). In contrast, no significant association
      was observed between ACR and ucMGP in either unadjusted or adjusted analyses
      (adjusted P = 0.17). All associations were similar among subjects with or without
      diabetes (P-values for interaction > 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: Among outpatients with
      stable CVD, a reduced glomerular filtration rate is associated with a decreased
      serum ucMGP level. In contrast, ACR is not associated with ucMGP levels. Whether 
      ucMGP is a useful marker of vascular calcification and CVD event risk in persons 
      with CKD deserves future study.

TI  - Efficacy of hyperphosphatemia control in the progression of chronic renal failure
      and the prevalence of cardiovascular calcification.
PG  - 21-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chronic kidney disease mineral- and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) 
      has been studied more often in dialysis than in predialysis CKD patients. The
      association between efficacy of hyperphosphatemia control and chronic renal
      failure (CRF) progression, prevalence of bone disease and cardiovascular
      calcification was the objective of the present investigation. MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: 42 patients with CKD in Stage 5, regularly monitored for 5 years, were
      divided into Group 1 of 20 patients with normal serum phosphate (sPO4) levels and
      Group 2 of 22 patients with hyperphosphatemia registered at the majority of
      checks. Serum urea, creatinine, calcium (sCa) and sPO4 levels were regularly
      determined in the retrospective 5-year period. At the end of this period iPTH,
      bone alkaline phosphatase-BAP and inflammation markers (CRP, fetuin-A) were
      measured, valvular and arterial calcifications were detected by B mode
      echocardiogram and soft-tissue native radiograms of the pelvis and the wrist.
      RESULTS: Progression of CRF (1/sCr over time) was faster in Group 2 than in Group
      1 (b = -0.0577 vs. -0.0288, p = 0.003) during the study period. Average BAP and
      iPTH values were similar in both groups and 23/42 patients had PTH > 300 pg/ml.
      Arterial and valvular calcifications were found in 5/23 patients from Group 1 and
      14/22 patients from Group 2 (p = 0.011). Linear regression analysis revealed sPO4
      as a predictor for total calcification number, inflammatory diseases as a
      predictor for valvular calcifications, while sPO4 and iPTH were predictors for
      arterial calcifications. CONCLUSIONS: More than half the patients with Stage 5
      CKD not yet on dialysis exhibited elevated PTH. Faster CRF progression and
      frequent arterial and valvular calcifications were seen in patients with poor
      phosphate control and sPO4 was selected as an independent predictor of total
      calcification score.

TI  - Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis: unusual
      clinical associations and novel claudin16 mutation in an Egyptian family.
PG  - 288-294
LID - 10.1007/s10157-008-0126-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis
      (FHHNC) is a rare autosomal recessive tubular disorder that eventually progresses
      to renal failure, depending upon the extent of nephrocalcinosis. Its basic
      pathogenesis is impaired tubular resorption of magnesium and calcium in the thick
      ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL) due to a genetic defect in paracellin-1
      (a tight junction protein expressed in TAL). Mutations of the claudin16 gene
      (CLDN16), formerly called paracellin-1 gene (PCLN-1), have been linked to FHHNC. 
      METHODS: An extended Egyptian family with more than one member affection by
      nephrocalcionsis was included and thoroughly investigated in the current study
      after giving informed consent. Thorough history was taken for polyuria,
      polydipsia and hypocalcemia symptoms, as well as clinical examination with stress
      on anthropometric measurements and radiological evaluation for kidneys and bones.
      Laboratory workup for the differential diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis was done:
      complete urinalysis, including urinary calcium excretion, urine pH and
      electrolytes, arterial blood gas (ABG), serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium,
      calcium, magnesium and phosphorous), renal function tests as well as parathyroid 
      and gonadotropin-sex hormone assay. DNA extraction from peripheral blood
      leukocytes was done followed by amplification using primers previously described,
      purification and finally sequencing to analyze each exon of the CLDN16 gene.
      RESULTS: Two sibs for a consanguineous couple were affected by nephrocalcinosis
      and showed persistent hypocalcemia, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis with
      persistently alkaline urine and ocular manifestations in the form of congenital
      cataracts, high myopia and retinal abnormalities. The elder sib showed
      genitourinary abnormalities in the form of hypospadias and cryptorchidism. These 
      two sibs had a homozygous two-base deletion in exon 1 of the CLDN16 gene (C.
      233_234 del GG; Ins C), causing a frame shift mutation (Arg55 fs); however, their
      parents were heterozygote carriers for that mutation. CONCLUSION: The
      above-mentioned clinical data in the two affected sibs together with the family
      history of end-stage renal disease associated with nephrocalcinosis and high
      myopia suggested a diagnosis of FHHNC, which was confirmed for the first time in 
      an Egyptian family by a novel mutation in exon 1 of the CLDN16 gene.
      Genitourinary associations with FHHNC have not yet been reported in the
      literature. Here, we will try to highlight the principles of mutation detection
      based on sequencing with the use of the online NCBI databases, statistics and
      other search tools.

TI  - Aortic calcification predicts cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in
      renal transplantation.
PG  - 1314-9
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn753 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among renal
      transplant recipients. Aortic calcification is associated with increased
      mortality in dialysis subjects. The significance of aortic calcification among
      renal transplant recipients is unknown. Our objective was to prospectively
      examine the association of aortic calcification with cardiovascular events and
      all-cause mortality among asymptomatic incident renal transplant recipients.
      METHODS: One hundred and twelve renal transplant recipients underwent electron
      beam computed tomography. Aortic calcification was scored by the Agatston method.
      The mean follow-up time was 5.1 years. Cardiovascular events (heart failure,
      coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke) and all-cause
      mortality were recorded. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 62% Caucasians, 38%
      African Americans and 62% male gender. The mean age was 49.0 +/- 12.5 years.
      Thirty-four percent had aortic calcification. During follow-up, 12 cardiovascular
      events and 10 deaths were recorded. Subjects with aortic calcification had more
      cardiovascular events compared to those without aortic calcification (23.7 versus
      4.1%, P = 0.001). Recipients with aortic calcification had higher mortality
      compared to those without aortic calcification but it did not reach statistical
      significance (15.8 versus 5.4%, P = 0.07). The univariate hazard ratio of aortic 
      calcification score in a proportional hazard Cox model to assess event-free
      survival was 1.15 (1.04-1.27, P = 0.01). Diabetes and aortic calcification score 
      were independently associated with survival. In addition to the predictors above,
      dialysis vintage was an independent predictor for combined future cardiovascular 
      event and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, aortic calcification is
      prevalent among renal transplant recipients and is predictive of future
      cardiovascular events. Aortic calcification is easily identified by non-invasive 
      testing, and should be considered when assessing cardiovascular risk in
      asymptomatic renal transplant recipients.

TI  - Vascular calcification of the aortic arch and peripheral artery in haemodialysis 
      patients with and without diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - AIM: to look for differences in clinical characteristics, and differences in the 
      role of mineral metabolism disorders and inflammation in diabetic and non
      diabetic patients. METHODS: subjects were 127 patients on maintenance
      haemodialysis: 46 with DM and 81 without. Vascular calcification of the aortic
      arch and peripheral artery were recorded qualitatively using x-ray of the chest
      and lower extremities. Clinical characteristics and laboratory values were taken 
      from the medical records. RESULTS: the overall prevalence of vascular
      calcification was similar in our haemodialysis patients, with or without DM
      (26.1% vs 25.9%). The diabetic patients were in general of older age (58.5+10.3
      vs 51.6+12.6 years, p<0.05), had lower diastolic BP (80+14 vs 86+14 mmHg,
      p<0.05), and higher prevalence of isolated peripheral artery calcification (13%
      vs 2.5%, p<0.05). Vascular calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients
      occurred at the same rate in spite of a lower serum P, (5.7+1.5 vs 6.9+1.5 mg/dl,
      p<0.05), and Ca X P product (52.3+14.5 vs 60.7+14.5, p<0.05), and shorter HD
      vintage (1.3+0.9 vs 3.2+3.3 years, p<0.05). In a sub analysis comparing patients 
      according to presence and location of vascular calcification, patients with
      vascular calcification of the peripheral artery only were mostly diabetics (75%),
      had lower serum Ca (8.6+0.5mg/dl), P (6.7+0.6mg/dl), Ca x P product (57.4+5.10
      mg2/dl2), and higher serum CRP (1.70+1.59mg/dl). CONCLUSION: diabetic patients on
      HD may be at higher risk for peripheral artery calcification, at lower serum Ca, 
      P, and Ca X P product. The higher CRP may indicate a higher inflammatory status, 
      which is probably the major risk factor for vascular calcification of the
      peripheral artery.

TI  - Fetuin-A and arterial stiffness in patients with normal kidney function.
PG  - 39-43
LID - 10.1016/j.regpep.2008.12.001 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the association between fetuin-A level (AHSG), its encoding gene
      (Thr256Ser) and arterial function in subjects with normal kidney function.
      INTRODUCTION: The aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) is a predictor for
      cardiovascular mortality. Fetuin-A is a calcification inhibitor and correlates
      negatively with increased vascular stiffness in dialysis patients. The fetuin-A
      polymorphism (Thr256Ser) is associated with reduced fetuin levels and accelerated
      vascular calcification in dialysis patients. Little is known about the role of
      fetuin-A as an independent predictor for the development of arterial stiffness in
      healthy subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 116 subjects with normal
      kidney function (age 47+/-12 years, 50 females and 66 males) of the FLEMENGHO
      study. Calcium measurements, plasma fetuin-A, its encoding gene (Thr256Ser) and
      indexes of arterial stiffness, such as aPWV and arterial distensibility, were
      determined. RESULTS: Fetuin-A levels were negatively correlated with aPWV
      (r=-0.21, p=0.029). After an adjustment for multiple covariables, fetuin-A levels
      were independently associated with aPWV (r=-0.30, p=0.022) in males but not in
      females. Male fetuin-A SerSer carrier had lower fetuin-A levels and higher aPWV
      (fetuin-A: 61.9+/-29.0 microg/ml; aPWV: 14.3+/-0.9 m/s) as compared to ThrThr
      (fetuin-A: 109.9+/-54.9 microg/ml; aPWV: 6.4+/-1.3 m/s) and ThrSer carrier
      (fetuin-A: 100.8+/-52.5 microg/ml; aPWV: 6.6+/-1.3 m/s). Other calcium variables 
      were not significantly associated with arterial stiffness. CONCLUSION: With
      respect to common calcium variables, only fetuin-A level showed an inverse
      relation with aPWV in men with normal renal function. Male fetuin-A SerSer
      carriers demonstrate particularly high aortic stiffness, possibly implying a
      status of increased cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Relation of serum fetuin-A levels to coronary artery calcium in African-American 
      patients on chronic hemodialysis.
PG  - 46-9
LID - 10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.08.032 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcium deposition in end-stage renal disease occurs commonly, but its
      relation to cardiovascular risk factors and fetuin-A levels in African Americans 
      is not known. Compliant African American patients who were undergoing
      hemodialysis (HD; n = 17) agreed to undergo 64-slice multidetector computed
      tomography for the assessment of coronary artery calcium score (CACS). The
      relation between traditional cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., age; gender;
      dialysis vintage; history of diabetes; means of the previous 3 years of weekly
      predialysis blood pressure values and hemoglobin levels; means of monthly values 
      of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, uric acid; and albumin; and means
      of quarterly measurements of parathyroid hormone and lipids) and fetuin-A levels 
      and CACS was explored using univariate analyses. Serum phosphorus levels over the
      previous 3 years were well controlled. The CACS range was 0 to 3,877 Agatston
      units (mean 996, median 196). Among the tested variables, only fetuin-A was
      significantly and inversely associated with CACS (standardized beta = -0.64, 95% 
      confidence interval -18.09 to -3.62, p = 0.006). There was no association between
      age and fetuin-A level (standardized beta = -0.02, 95% confidence interval -0.10 
      to 0.23). In conclusion, African-American patients who were undergoing long-term 
      hemodialysis and with good phosphorus control exhibited a strong inverse
      correlation between fetuin-A level and CACS that was independent of age.

TI  - Low serum fetuin-A concentration predicts poor outcome only in the presence of
      inflammation in prevalent haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 804-11
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2362.2008.02032.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetuin-A, a negative acute phase protein that inhibits vascular
      calcification, has a controversial association with mortality in chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) patients. Chronic inflammation, which is common in CKD, may promote
      vascular calcification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the impact of
      inflammation on the relationship between serum fetuin-A and mortality (42 months)
      in 222 prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients. RESULTS: Serum fetuin correlated
      negatively with comorbidity score (assessed by Davies score) and circulating
      inflammatory markers. Patients with low fetuin-A levels (< median) had higher
      mortality (Hazard ratio 'HR' 2.2; CI 1.4-3.5, P < 0.001), but this association
      was lost after adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities score, dialysis vintage 
      and inflammation (CRP > median). In inflamed patients with low fetuin a
      significantly independent association with mortality (HR 2.3; CI 1.2-4.5, P =
      0.01) was observed compared to non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A, after
      adjusting for the same variables. Non-inflamed patients with low fetuin-A and
      inflamed patients with high fetuin-A did not have increased mortality compared to
      non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that low 
      levels of serum fetuin-A are associated with increased mortality in HD patients
      only in the presence of inflammation. This suggests that coexistence of a low
      serum fetuin-A level and low-grade inflammation exerts an additive effect on the 
      risk of death in HD patients.

      from the BRiC study.
PG  - c273-83
LID - 10.1159/000170783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Calcium-containing phosphate binders have been shown to
      increase the progression of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. This
      is a prospective study that compares the effects of calcium acetate and sevelamer
      on coronary calcification (CAC) and bone histology. METHODS: 101 hemodialysis
      patients were randomized for each phosphate binder and submitted to multislice
      coronary tomographies and bone biopsies at entry and 12 months. RESULTS: The 71
      patients who concluded the study had similar baseline characteristics. On
      follow-up, the sevelamer group had higher levels of intact parathyroid hormone
      (498 +/- 352 vs. 326 +/- 236 pg/ml, p = 0.017), bone alkaline phosphatase (38 +/-
      24 vs. 28 +/- 15 U/l, p = 0.03) and deoxypyridinoline (135 +/- 107 vs. 89 +/- 71 
      nmol/l, p = 0.03) and lower LDL cholesterol (74 +/- 21 vs. 91 +/- 28 mg/dl, p =
      0.015). Phosphorus (5.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 6 +/- 1.0 mg/dl, p = 0.47) and calcium (1.27 
      +/- 0.07 vs. 1.23 +/- 0.08 mmol/l, p = 0.68) levels did not differ between
      groups. CAC progression (35 vs. 24%, p = 0.94) and bone histological diagnosis at
      baseline and 12 months were similar in both groups. Patients of the sevelamer
      group with a high turnover at baseline had an increase in bone resorption (eroded
      surface, ES/BS = 9.0 +/- 5.9 vs. 13.1 +/- 9.5%, p = 0.05), whereas patients of
      both groups with low turnover at baseline had an improvement in bone formation
      rate (BFR/BS = 0.015 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.062 +/- 0.078, p = 0.003 for calcium and
      0.017 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.071 +/- 0.084 microm(3)/microm(2)/day, p = 0.010 for
      sevelamer). CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in CAC progression or changes in
      bone remodeling between the calcium and the sevelamer groups.

PG  - 39-42
AB  - Calcium-phosphate disorders and vascular calcification are highly prevalent in
      patients with diabetes mellitus and nephropathy. The aim of the study was to
      compare the prevalence and advancement of vascular calcification in patients with
      end-stage diabetic nephropathy on peritoneal dialysis and diabetic patients with 
      chronic renal disease stages 2-4. The study group included 31 patients with type 
      2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy divided into 2 groups: 12 patients (aged
      50-74 years: mean 58.6+/-8.8) undergoing peritoneal dialysis and 19 patients
      (aged 46-82 years; mean 65.8+/-9.7) with chronic kidney disease stages 2-4 (GFR
      range 24-78 ml/min/1.73 m2). Coronary artery calcification score, was assessed
      using multi-slice computed tomography. Coronary artery calcification score did
      not differ significantly between groups (CaSc values 1085.2 vs 452.4 AgU; NS).
      The patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis showed significantly higher levels of
      parathyroid hormone (658.2 vs. 74.3 pg/ml; p=0.001), fibrinogen (5.82 vs. 3.89
      g/l; p<0.0001) and alkaline phosphatase (330.9 vs. 168.0 U/l; p=0.001). Despite
      more advanced abnormalities in calcium-phosphate balance parameters and more
      active inflammation in peritoneal dialysis subjects we failed to demonstrate any 
      statistically significant difference in coronary artery calcification score
      between patients with diabetic nephropathy on peritoneal dialysis and those with 
      chronic kidney disease stages 2-4.

TI  - Peripheral vascular calcification in long-haemodialysis patients: associated
      factors and survival consequences.
PG  - 948-55
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfn571 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications (VCs) are frequently observed in chronic
      kidney disease (CKD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients. They have been associated
      with numerous factors, particularly hyperphosphataemia, excess calcium load,
      hypertension and increased mortality rate. The purpose of this study is to
      measure VCs in long-HD patients with good blood pressure and phosphate control,
      with the occasional use of sevelamer, using a plain radiological score to
      identify the associated factors and effects on the 1-year survival rate. METHODS:
      We studied HD patients from one centre using a semi-quantitative score ranging
      from 0 to 3 according to the severity and extent of VCs. The following patients' 
      characteristics were compared according to their VC scores: medical history,
      treatments, blood pressure, standard biological data, fibroblast growth factor
      (FGF) 23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), whole PTH, beta-crosslaps, bone alkaline
      phosphatases and bone mineral density scores. One-year survival analyses were
      also performed. RESULTS: Among the 250 HD patients of the centre, 161 were
      studied; the mean age was 67.2 +/- 13 years, 45% of the subjects were females,
      35% were diabetics, and they had been on dialysis for between 1-486 months
      (median: 45 months) with a 3 x 5-3 x 8 h dialysis schedule using 1.5 mmol/l
      dialysate calcium and providing a mean 2.25 +/- 0.5 Kt/V. Only 17% of the
      patients were free from VCs and 11% had severe VCs. The factors associated with
      VCs were classified into 'classic' (age, diabetes, male gender, tobacco use,
      inflammation, more frequent warfarin treatment and peripheral vascular and
      cardiac diseases) and 'non-traditional' (higher FGF-23 and OPG serum levels, low 
      albumin serum levels and low alfacalcidol and CaCO(3) use). In logistic
      regression, only age, diabetes and FGF-23 serum levels were associated with VC
      scores of 2 and 3. The patients with a score of 3 had a higher 1-year mortality
      rate (RR 2.1; P = 0.01) as compared to patients with a 0 score. CONCLUSION: A
      plain radiological score showed the high prevalence (83%) of VCs in HD patients
      in spite of a long and intensive dialysis strategy and adherence to guidelines.
      The main associated factors were classic factors such as ageing and diabetes. No 
      relationship was found with blood pressure and phosphataemia that remained well
      controlled in long dialysis; the association with FGF-23 serum levels may
      aggregate some non-traditional risk factors. The harmful effects of VCs on
      survival require their systematic assessment and optimization of the potentially 
      modifiable associated factors in CKD and HD patients.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are common and
      frequently coexist. Among subjects with CKD, arterial disease may be due to
      atherosclerosis, medial arterial calcification (MAC), or both conditions
      concomitantly. It is important for clinicians to recognize both conditions
      because each identifies individuals at higher risk of cardiovascular disease
      events, and because the presence of MAC complicates interpretation of the ankle
      brachial index, the most commonly used diagnostic test for artherosclerotic PAD. 
      To that end, we review the epidemiology and diagnosis of atherosclerotic PAD and 
      medical arterial calcification in patients with CKD.

LID - 10.1159/000157629 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients on hemodialysis (HD) frequently experience cardiovascular
      events associated with vascular calcification. We investigated the involvement of
      osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of vascular calcification, in the incidence
      of cardiovascular events and mortality among new HD patients. METHODS: We
      conducted a prospective cohort study of the association of serum OPG levels with 
      morbidity and mortality in subjects who became new HD patients between June 2000 
      and May 2006. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (age 58.9 +/- 14.6 years, 65 male, 
      34 female) were prospectively followed up for 41.5 +/- 20.2 months. During this
      period, 27 patients developed cardiovascular events and 12 died of causes related
      to cardiovascular disease. When divided into 2 groups according to OPG levels,
      the high OPG group showed a higher prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality compared with the low OPG group. Cox's proportional hazards analysis
      associated the new onset of cardiovascular events with the high OPG group (HR
      2.88, 95% CI 1.09-7.62, p = 0.033). Furthermore, the high OPG group at the start 
      of HD was significantly associated with older age, male gender and a high aortic 
      calcification index. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of serum OPG in new HD patients
      may predict subsequent cardiovascular events.

LID - 10.1038/ki.2008.458 [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular mortality
      in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to identify
      risk factors for vascular access calcification and to determine if patients with 
      this disorder are at increased risk of death. Vascular access calcification was
      found in 49 of 212 hemodialysis patients as measured by plain X-ray
      (arteriovenous fistula or synthetic graft) in two dimensions. Male gender,
      diabetes mellitus, and length of time on dialysis were independent predictors for
      access calcification determined by logistic regression multivariate analysis.
      Serum parameters were not independently related to access calcification.
      Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increased mortality risk, and Cox regression
      analysis confirmed that vascular access calcification was an independent
      mortality predictor. Our study suggests that detection of vascular access
      calcification is a cost-effective method to identify patients at increased
      mortality risk.

      patients].
PG  - 313-8
AB  - Cardiovascular (CVS) morbidity and mortality in the end-stage renal disease
      (ESRD) patients on peritoneal dialysis therapy is 10-30 folds higher than in
      general population. The prevalence of well known traditional risk factors such as
      age, sex, race, arterial hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, smoking,
      physical inactivity is higher in the uraemic patients. Besides these, there are
      specific, nontraditional risk factors for dialysis patients. Mild inflammation
      present in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients which can be confirmed by specific
      inflammatory markers is the cause of CVS morbidity and mortality in these
      patients. Hypoalbuminaemia, hyperhomocysteinaemia and a higher level of leptin
      are important predictors of vascular complications as well as CVS events in the
      PD patients. Plasma norepinephrine, an indicator of sympathetic activity, is high
      in the ESRD patients and higher in the PD patients than in the patients on
      haemodialysis (HD). Therefore, norepinephrine may be a stronger risk factor in
      the PD patients. The same applies to asymmetric dimethylargine (ADMA), an
      endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, which is an important risk factor 
      of CVS morbidity and mortality 15 % higher in the PD than the HD patients.
      Hyperphosphataemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism and high calcium x phosphate
      product have been associated with the progression of the coronary artery
      calcification and valvular calcifications and predict all-cause CVS mortality in 
      the PD patients. Residual renal function (RRF) declines with time on dialysis but
      is slower in the PD than the HD patients. RRF decline is associated with the rise
      of proinflammatory cytokines and the onset of hypervolaemia and hypertension
      which increase the risk of CVS diseases, mortality in general and CVS mortality. 
      In conclusion, it is very important to establish all CVS risk factors in the PD
      patients to prevent CVS diseases and CVS mortality in this population.

TI  - Kidney transplantation for patients on long-term hemodialysis.
PG  - 2297-8
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.06.019 [doi]
AB  - Patients surviving more than 10 years on hemodialysis (HD) are at risk of
      developing serious morbidity from unrelated conditions and from the many
      complications of long-term dialysis, such as cardiovascular disease,
      cerebrovascular disease, malignant tumors ectopic vascular calcification,
      diabetes mellitus, and disuse atrophy of the bladder. Long-term dialysis affects 
      transplant patient outcomes and long-term graft survival. We analyzed 436
      patients who underwent kidney transplantations between January 1987 and December 
      2007 to determine the impact of long-term dialysis on kidney transplant outcomes.
      The 39 patients who had been treated pretransplantation with dialysis for more
      than 10 years had an average length of dialysis treatment of 15.8 years (range,
      10.0-32.5 years); they were denoted as the long-term hemodialysis group. The
      remaining 397 recipients showed an average of 3.7 years period of end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) (range, 0-9.8, years; short-term hemodialysis group). There were
      significant differences in patient survival rates between the 2 groups: 93.2% vs 
      98.6%, at 1 year; 79.3% vs 95.4% at 5 years; and 58.4% vs 93.1% at 10 years (P = 
      .0034). Also, graft survival was significantly different between the 2 groups:
      89.2% vs 95.8% at 1 year; 60.4% vs 88.5% at 5 years; and 33.4% vs 80.4% at 10
      years (P = .0026). Our results suggest that dialysis treatment for more than 10
      years produces negative effects on post-transplantation patient and graft
      survival.

TI  - Vitamin D deficiency and associated factors in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 395-9
LID - 10.1053/j.jrn.2008.04.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the general elderly population, 
      and is related to an increased risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and
      cardiovascular calcification. Only limited data and no guidelines are available
      on vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis patients. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess
      the frequency of, and factors associated with, 25(OH) vitamin D deficiency in
      hemodialysis patients in a French dialysis center. DESIGN: In March 2006, we
      studied all prevalent hemodialysis patients who had not received native vitamin D
      supplements in the recent past. According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes and
      Quality Initiative guidelines, patients were assigned to the following 3 groups: 
      group 1, with a sufficient vitamin D serum level (>75 nmol/L); group 2, with an
      insufficient level (25 to 75 nmol/L); and group 3, with severe deficiency (<25
      nmol/L). Patients' characteristics and biochemical findings were compared between
      patients of groups 1 and 3. RESULTS: Of 253 patients, 11% patients were in group 
      1; 47% were in group 2; and 42% were in group 3. The proportions of female and
      diabetes patients were 42% and 34%, respectively. The mean (+/- SD) age of all
      patients was 66.7 +/- 14 years, and the mean duration of dialysis was 62 +/- 74
      months, with a mean schedule of 3 x 6.5 hours and administration of a 1.5 mmol/L 
      calcium dialysate. Concomitant treatment included alfacalcidol (66% of patients) 
      and sevelamer (34% of patients) as a standard phosphate binder. Group 3 patients 
      had a lower dialysis vintage (53 +/- 66 vs. 73 +/- 85 months, P < .05), a higher 
      number of diabetes patients (45% vs. 21%, P < .05), a higher number of female
      patients (53% vs. 28%, P < .05), and a higher level of intact parathyroid hormone
      (260 +/- 227 vs. 213 +/- 153 pg/mL, P < .05) than group 1 patients. No
      relationship was found between vitamin D storage levels and bone markers, serum
      calcium, phosphorus, albumin, body mass index, normalized protein catabolic rate,
      radiologic vascular calcification score, and hip bone mineral density. In
      multivariate logistic regression analyses, no factors were significantly
      associated with vitamin D deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Calcidiol deficiency was
      highly prevalent in a French dialysis population. The associated factors mainly
      included female sex, diabetes, shorter dialysis duration, and higher intact
      parathyroid hormone level. Although there are no guidelines for the therapy of
      patients with chronic kidney disease at stage 5, the usefulness of vitamin D
      supplementation may be assessed by considering its potential direct action, the
      need for providing fuel for renal and extrarenal calcitriol production in
      particular, and the numerous potential favorable effects on health.

AB  - It is uncertain whether moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) or measures of
      kidney function are associated with subclinical atherosclerosis as represented by
      coronary artery calcium (CAC) or abdominal aortic calcium (AAC). We used logistic
      and linear regression analyses to relate CKD (glomerular filtration rate <60
      ml/min/1.73 m(2)), cystatin C (cysC), and microalbuminuria (MA) with CAC and AAC 
      obtained using multidetector computed tomography in Framingham Heart Study
      Offspring participants (mean age 59 years, 55.3% women). Increased CAC and AAC
      were defined as > or =90th percentile age- and gender-specific cutpoints based on
      a healthy referent sample. Major cardiovascular disease risk factors were
      accounted for in multivariable models. Of 1,179 participants, 1,174 had AAC
      measurements and 1,147 had CAC measurements, 6.3% had CKD, and 8.3% had MA. CKD
      was not associated with CAC (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio [OR] for CKD 1.18,
      95% confidence interval 0.59 to 2.36, p = 0.63) or AAC (multivariable-adjusted OR
      for CKD 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 2.04, p = 0.73). CysC was
      associated with CAC in age- and gender-adjusted but not in multivariable models
      (age- and gender-adjusted OR for log cysC per SD increment and CAC 1.19, 95%
      confidence interval 1.01 to 1.41, p = 0.04; multivariable-adjusted OR 1.14, 95%
      confidence interval 0.95 to 1.38, p = 0.15). MA was not associated with CAC (OR
      0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 1.61, p = 0.54). Neither cysC nor MA was
      significantly associated with AAC in age- and gender- or multivariable-adjusted
      models. In conclusion, CKD, cysC, and MA are not associated with CAC or AAC when 
      accounting for cardiovascular disease risk factors.

TI  - Relationship between serum pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor/visfatin and
      atherosclerotic parameters in chronic hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 31-5
LID - 10.1159/000148648 [doi]
AB  - Pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF)/visfatin is produced by adipose tissue,
      skeletal muscle, bone marrow, the liver and lymphocytes. Although serum
      PBEF/visfatin is related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and its level is
      elevated in patients with chronic kidney disease, it remains unclear whether
      increased PBEF/visfatin is associated with atherosclerotic parameters in
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we measured serum PBEF/visfatin in 68 
      chronic HD patients (age 66 +/- 14 years, time on HD 76 +/- 76 months, 41 males, 
      27 females) and examined the association of serum PBEF/visfatin with serum
      asymmetric dimethylarginine, arteriosclerotic parameters such as pulse wave
      velocity, ankle brachial pressure index and the percent of abdominal aortic wall 
      calcification in a cross-sectional fashion. Serum PBEF/visfatin was significantly
      correlated with time on HD (r = 0.29, p = 0.02), but not with age, gender and
      diabetes. There was no association between PBEF/visfatin and body mass index,
      abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat mass area, and total adiponectin. Serum
      PBEF/visfatin was significantly positively correlated with log-transformed highly
      sensitive C-reactive protein (r = 0.26, p < 0.05) but negatively with serum
      albumin (r = -0.33, p < 0.01). In contrast, there was no association between
      serum PBEF/visfatin and asymmetric dimethylarginine, aortic pulse wave velocity, 
      brachial ankle pressure index and percent of abdominal aortic wall calcification.
      It follows from these findings that serum PBEF/visfatin may reflect the
      inflammatory status rather than atherosclerotic changes in chronic HD patients.

      either above-knee (n = 38), below-knee (n = 5), or through-knee (n = 1)
      amputation for pedal sepsis/gangrene. The 51 vessels (anterior tibial, n = 9;
      posterior tibial, n = 10; peroneal, n = 3; popliteal, n = 29) were obtained and
      underwent intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) evaluation ex vivo within 24 hr of
      amputation. Sequential IVUS data were obtained at known intervals throughout the 
      vessel length and then analyzed with radiofrequency techniques for quantification
      of plaque composition, plaque volume, and total vessel volume. Plaque composition
      was categorized as fibrous, fibro-fatty, necrotic core, and dense calcium.
      Clinical data were obtained via review of electronic records at the time of
      amputation. Two-sided t-tests were performed to compare components within each
      plaque. Results are expressed as mean percentage +/- standard error of the mean. 
      Tibial vessels had more dense calcium within these plaques than popliteal
      arteries (33.8 +/- 5.6% vs. 10.6 +/- 1.9%, p < 0.001). Consequently, distal
      vessels had less fibro-fatty and fibrous plaque than popliteal arteries (7.7 +/- 
      1.4% vs. 13.1 +/- 1.2%, p < 0.005; 42.4 +/- 4.7% vs. 61.4 +/- 2.2%, p < 0.001,
      respectively). Necrotic core plaque composition was found to be similar when
      comparing tibial versus popliteal arteries (16.1% vs. 14.9%, p = nonsignificant).
      Clinical factors including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and chronic renal
      insufficiency were not associated with plaque composition differences using a
      univariate analysis. As we progress distally in the arterial tree of patients
      with PAD, calcium plaque content increases with decreasing burden of fibro-fatty 
      plaque. Clinical and demographic factors, with the exception of smoking, were not
      found to be associated with atherosclerotic plaque composition.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To establish the normal criterion of ascending aortic
      diameter (AAOD) measured by 64 multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and
      electron beam computed tomography (EBT) based on gender and age. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 1442 consecutive subjects who were referred for evaluation of
      possible coronary artery disease underwent coronary computed tomographic (CT)
      angiography (CTA) and coronary artery calcium scanning (CACS) (55 + 11 years, 65%
      male) without known coronary heart disease, hypertension, chronic pulmonary and
      renal disease, diabetes, and severe aortic calcification. The AAOD aortic
      diameter, descending aortic diameter (DAOD), pulmonary artery (PAD), and chest
      anteroposterior diameter (CAPD), posterior border of the sternal bone to the
      anterior border of the spine, were measured at the slice level of mid-right
      pulmonary artery using end systolic trigger imaging. The volume of four chambers,
      ejection fraction of left ventricle, and cardiac output were measured in 56% of
      the patients. Patients' demographic information, age, gender, weight, height, and
      body surface area were recorded. The mean value and age-specific and
      gender-adjusted upper normal limits (mean +/- 2 standard deviation) were
      calculated. The linear correlation analysis was done between AAOD and all
      parameters. The reproducibility, wall thickness, and difference between
      end-systole and end-diastole were calculated. RESULTS: AAOD has significant
      linear association with age, gender, DAOD, and pulmonary artery diameter (P <
      .05). There is no significant correlation between AAOD and body surface area,
      four-chamber volume, left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, and
      CAPD. The mean intraluminal AAOD was 31.1 +/- 3.9 and 33.6 +/- 4.1 mm in females 
      and males, respectively. The upper normal limits (mean +/- 2 standard deviations)
      of intraluminal AAOD, were 35.6, 38.3, and 40 mm for females and 37.8, 40.5, and 
      42.6 mm for males in age groups 20-40, 41-60, and older than 60 years,
      respectively. Intraluminal aortic diameters should parallel echocardiography and 
      invasive angiography. Traditional cross-sectional imaging (with CT and magnetic
      resonance imaging) includes the vessel wall. The mean total AAOD was 33.5 and
      36.0 mm in females and males, respectively. The upper normal limits (mean +/- 2
      standard deviations) of intraluminal AAOD were 38.0, 40.7 and 42.4 mm for females
      and 40.2, 42.9, and 45.0 mm for males in age group 20 to 40, 41 to 60, and older 
      than 60 years, respectively. The inter- and intraobserver, scanner, and repeated 
      measurement variabilities were low (r value >0.91, P < .001, coefficient
      variation <3.2%). AAOD was 1.7 mm smaller in end-diastole than end-systole (P <
      .001). CONCLUSIONS: The AAOD increases with age and male gender. Gender-specific 
      and age-adjusted normal values for aortic diameters are necessary to
      differentiate pathologic atherosclerotic changes in the ascending aorta. Use of
      intraluminal or total aortic diameter values depends on the comparison study
      employed.

TI  - Aortic stiffness and valvular calcifications in patients with end-stage renal
      disease.
PG  - 111-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the presence and extent of cardiac calcifications and
      aortic stiffness in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: The study group consisted of 60 patients with ESRD with a mean age of
      51.7 years, treated with peritoneal dialysis. In all patients transthoracic
      echocardiogram was performed to assess the following parameters: left ventricular
      end-systolic diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd),
      interventricular septum end-diastolic diameter (IVSDd), posterior wall
      end-diastolic diameter (PWDd), ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening
      (FS), aortic maximal and minimal diameter, aortic valve area, mitral valve area
      (MVA), left ventricular ejection time (LVET), maximal aortic velocity. Aortic
      stiffness index (AS) was calculated. Aortic and mitral valve calcifications were 
      assessed. RESULTS: Patients with ESRD had a larger left ventricle (LVEDd 5.4 cm
      vs. 4.76 cm) and its wall was thicker (IVSDd 1.36 cm vs. 1.02 cm; PWDd 1.31 cm
      vs. 0.94 cm). Patients had poorer left ventricle contractility (EF 56.1 vs.
      61.6%; FS 28.5 vs. 33.2%). Atherosclerotic plaques, calcified plaques and
      valvular calcifications were more frequently detected in patients with ESRD.
      Patients with ESRD had significantly higher values of the AS index: (5.34 vs.
      3.24). Among ESRD subjects with the stiffer aorta, atherosclerotic plaques
      including calcificones and the aortic valve damage were more frequently detected.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ESRD are characterized by increased aortic stiffness. 
      Atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta as well as cardiac and large vessels
      calcifications are more common among patients with ESRD. In patients with ESRD
      there is a correlation between an increase in aortic stiffness and damage of
      aortic valvular leaflets as well as calcifications of atherosclerotic plaques in 
      the aorta. The degree of aortic stiffness is not related to impairment of mitral 
      valvular leaflets and extravalvular calcifications. A relationship between aortic
      stiffness and aortic or aortic valve calcifications suggest a different
      pathogenesis of aorta calcification as compared to that underlying calcifications
      of other localizations.

TI  - Effects of sevelamer on the progression of vascular calcification in patients on 
      chronic haemodialysis.
PG  - c278-83
LID - 10.1159/000127361 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Vascular calcification is thought to be associated with a high
      cardiovascular mortality rate in patients with end-stage renal disease. Control
      of hyperphosphataemia is important for the treatment of the vascular
      calcification. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of
      sevelamer hydrochloride on the progression of aortic calcification in
      haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: 42 HD patients were studied in this study
      and divided into two groups (sevelamer vs. calcium). Sevelamer was added and
      titrated up to achieve serum P control for 6 months. The estimations of aortic
      calcification index (ACI) by abdominal computed tomography scans were performed
      twice in each patient. We compared the changes in serum calcium, phosphorus,
      intact parathyroid hormone, and lipids in two groups. RESULTS: Serum phosphorus
      levels decreased significantly from 6.7 +/- 0.7 to 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/dl with no
      changes in serum intact parathyroid hormone levels in the sevelamer group (p <
      0.01), and increased from 6.5 +/- 1.0 to 6.7 +/- 1.1 mg/dl in the calcium group
      (p < 0.05). Serum calcium levels did not change in the sevelamer group and
      calcium group. The serum levels of total cholesterol decreased significantly from
      158.5 +/- 20.7 to 146.2 +/- 24.1 mg/dl (p = 0.024) and the low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol level from 65.3 +/- 14.4 to 54.7 +/- 11.6 mg/dl (p =
      0.014) in the sevelamer group. Serum C-reactive protein decreased significantly
      from 0.14 +/- 0.13 to 0.08 +/- 0.11 mg/dl in the sevelamer group (p = 0.038) and 
      significantly increased (0.18 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.22 +/- 0.12 mg/dl) in the calcium
      group (p = 0.042). The mean changes in ACI (DeltaACI) were 3.6 +/- 1.5% in the
      sevelamer group and 8.2 +/- 3.1% in the calcium group. CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer
      allows a better serum phosphorus control compared with calcium-based phosphate
      binder and suppresses the progression of aortic calcification in HD patients.

TI  - Atherogenesis in renal patients: a model of vascular disease?
PG  - 93-107
AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD), and particularly kidney failure, is associated with
      accelerated atherosclerosis and approximately a 20-fold increased risk of
      cardiovascular death. The majority of these patients die from complications
      directly attributed to atherosclerosis and their life expectancy is decreased.
      Established risk factors are involved in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon.
      Age, gender, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus are among
      the established risk factors. Inflammation, qualitative lipid disorders (e.g.
      small dense low density lipoprotein), vascular calcification and oxidative stress
      represent emerging risk factors. The precise mechanism of atherosclerosis in
      patients with kidney failure is not yet known. CKD might represent a clinical
      model of atherogenesis. Thus, the evidence obtained from investigating "renal"
      atherogenesis could be of interest in improving our understanding of this disease
      process in the non-renal population. We review the relationship between "renal"
      and non-renal atherosclerosis focusing on pathogenesis, risk factors and clinical
      events and how they interact with treatment options. Overall, the "later" stages 
      of CKD may eventually be considered as a coronary heart disease equivalent
      condition.

TI  - Intermittent doses of statin in hemodialysis patients with spontaneous low LDL
      cholesterol levels.
PG  - 104-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mortality in dialysis patients remains high and is due mainly to
      cardiovascular causes. Inflammation has a role in the genesis of accelerated
      atherosclerosis, vascular calcification, malnutrition and anemia, and a huge
      impact on the survival of these patients. The pleiotropic effects of statins can 
      be a therapeutic option for reducing chronic inflammatory processes of patients
      undergoing hemodialysis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of low doses of
      simvastatin on inflammatory markers, hematimetric and nutritional parameters of
      patients undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: Clinically-stable patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis were classified according to their baseline LDL-cholesterol levels
      in two groups: those with levels below 100mg/dl (Group 1) and those with levels
      equal to or greater than 100mg/dl (Group-2), and were treated with simvastatin
      during eight weeks. Group 1 received 20mg only after each session of hemodialysis
      (intermittent dose), whereas Group 2 received 20mg/daily. Laboratory data,
      erythropoietin resistance index and nutritional parameters were obtained before
      and after treatment. RESULTS: A significant and equivalent reduction in
      C-reactive protein levels in both groups was observed (35.97+/-49.23% vs
      38.32+/-32.69%, p=0.86). In group 1, there was also a tendency towards reduced
      resistance to erythropoietin (228.6+/-16.2 vs 208.9+/-16.2, p=0.058) and
      improvement of hematimetric parameters (hematocrit: 33.1+/-5.9% vs 36.1+/-4.5%,
      p=0.021). CONCLUSION: Intermittent doses proved to be as effective as the usual
      dose in reducing C-reactive protein levels and resistance to erythropoietin,
      besides improving the hematimetric parameters, indicating an important reduction 
      of the cardiovascular risk evaluated by these parameters.

TI  - [Calciphylaxis: fatal complication of cardiometabolic syndrome in patients with
      end stage kidney disease].
PG  - 32-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: Calciphylaxis characterized by schemic skin ulceration due to
      subcutaneous small arterioles calcification, is a rare disease but usually fatal.
      Disorders of calcium metabolism and vascular calcifications are common in
      dialysis patients but calciphylaxis prevalence is low in patients with end stage 
      renal disease. So we proposed other emergent factors implicated in calciphylaxis 
      development. METHODS: We studied retrospective 8 patients who developed
      calciphylaxis in our service from january 2001 to december 2006. RESULTS: All
      patients were female with mean age at diagnosis 68.5+/-6.7 years. All patients
      were receiving hemodialysis therapy and 6 patients had been receiving
      hemodialysis less than four months. Six patients had diabetes mellitus type II
      and all patients were obese (BMI >25 kg/m2). All patients had metabolic syndrome 
      (APTIII) with bad control hypertension and 6 (75%) were receiving anticoagulation
      therapy with warfarin. Patients didn t have severe alterations of calcium
      metabolism, all had product calcium-phosphorus <55. All patients developed low
      blood pressure at the beginning of dialysis treatment (98.3+/-22.7/60+/-18,29
      mmHg). 7 patients present proximal lesions in fatty regions like abdomen and
      thighs. Histopathologic examination reveals calcium deposits in arteriole-sized
      and small vessels with vascular thrombosis. Prognosis was poor, seven patients
      died secondary to a sepsis originated in infected cutaneous ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: 
      calciphylaxis is a disease with poor prognosis and high mortality, without
      specific treatment actually. Female gender, obesity associated with diabetes
      mellitus and cardiometabolic syndrome, anticoagulant therapy with warfarin and
      low blood pressure associated with hemodialysis therapy, are risk factors to
      develop calciphylaxis, in absence of severe disorders of calcium metabolism. In
      these patients is important to avoid hypotension episodes during dialysis,
      dialysis hypotension appears to be an important risk factor who promotes ischemia
      of subcutaneous adipose tissue.

TI  - The GLUT-1 XbaI gene polymorphism is associated with vascular calcifications in
      nondiabetic uremic patients.
PG  - c182-7
LID - 10.1159/000118940 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glucose transporters mediate the facilitative uptake of glucose into 
      cells, with GLUT-1 being the predominant isoform in vascular smooth muscle cell
      (VSMC). Clones of human cells overexpressing the GLUT-1 transporter showed a high
      increase in intracellular glucose concentrations, mimicking the diabetic milieu. 
      It is possible that high intracellular glucose together with uremic factors may
      play an important role in vascular calcification by transforming VSMC into
      osteoblast-like cells. The XbaI polymorphism in the GLUT-1 gene has been linked
      to variations in GLUT-1 expression, with consequent changes in intracellular
      glucose concentration. METHODS: To assess the association between the GLUT-1 XbaI
      gene polymorphism and the presence of VC in nondiabetic uremic patients, a total 
      of 105 nondiabetic patients on hemodialysis were studied. VC were evaluated by
      conventional simple X-ray. Mean values of serum calcium, phosphorous,
      cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, PTH and insulin were measured. Height, weight,
      BMI and waist circumference were also determined. The GLUT-1 XbaI polymorphism in
      the second intron of the gene was ascertained by means of the polymerase chain
      reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on DNA isolated
      from peripheral blood DNA. In the absence of an XbaI site, a fragment of 305 bp
      was seen (so-called x allele), whereas fragments of 232 and 73 bp were generated 
      if the XbaI site was present (X allele). RESULTS: Genotype distribution in all
      patients was similar to the Caucasian population. However, when the patients were
      grouped according to the presence or absence of VC, there were marked differences
      in the frequency of the GLUT1 genotypes: the xx GLUT-1 genotype was more
      prevalent in the group with VC (30.7 vs. 4.5%, p = 0.001). Stepwise logistic
      regression demonstrated that the xx GLUT-1 genotype was independently associated 
      with the presence of VC after adjusting for other variables such as age, calcium 
      x phosphrus product, BMI and time on dialysis (OR 7.68; 95% CI 1.28-45.7).
      CONCLUSIONS: GLUT-1 XbaI gene polymorphism is associated with vascular
      calcifications in nondiabetic uremic patients.

TI  - Effect of simvastatin in apolipoprotein E deficient mice with surgically induced 
      chronic renal failure.
PG  - 1631-6
LID - 10.1016/j.juro.2007.11.042 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with a surgically reduced renal mass are at increased risk for 
      progressive renal failure, which often requires renal replacement therapy or
      kidney transplantation. We investigated the effects of simvastatin
      supplementation on uremia enhanced atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in 
      apoE(-/-) (apolipoprotein E deficient) mice (Charles Rivers Laboratories,
      Wilmington, Massachusetts) with or without superimposed chronic kidney disease.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups, including 2
      groups with normal renal function (simvastatin vs control in 13 mice) and the
      other 2 with surgically created chronic kidney disease (simvastatin vs control in
      18). Simvastatin (100 mg/kg) was administered by daily oral gavage for 4 weeks.
      RESULTS: Simvastatin treatment did not prevent uremia accelerated atherosclerosis
      in chronic kidney disease apoE(-/-) mice, nor did it retard atherosclerosis
      progression in control nonchronic kidney disease mice. However, aortic plaques in
      simvastatin treated chronic kidney disease mice showed significantly less
      calcification than those in controls with chronic kidney disease (p <0.03). In
      addition, the increase of aortic nitrotyrosine staining in mice with chronic
      kidney disease was prevented by simvastatin treatment (p <0.02). Serum total
      cholesterol was increased to a similar extent in the 2 chronic kidney disease
      groups compared with that in the nonchronic kidney disease groups. The beneficial
      effect of simvastatin on uremia enhanced vascular calcification in apoE(-/-) mice
      with chronic kidney disease was observed despite the absence of changes in uremia
      accelerated atherosclerosis progression, serum total cholesterol levels or
      osteopontin and alkaline phosphatase expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our observation
      opens the possibility of a cholesterol independent action of statins on vascular 
      calcification via a decrease in oxidative stress.

TI  - The influence of atherosclerosis and plasma D-dimer concentration in patients
      with a functioning arteriovenous fistula for maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 503-8
LID - 10.1007/s11255-007-9321-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to deduce the influence of atherosclerosis
      and plasma D-dimer concentration on the functioning of arteriovenous fistulae for
      hemodialysis. METHODS: The study was organized as a prospective and
      non-randomized investigation in the "Kragujevac" Clinical Center. The 81 examined
      patients, 49 (60.5%) males and 32 (39.5%) females, were divided into a group (n =
      36) requiring several attempts to create arteriovenous fistulae for hemodialysis 
      and a group (n = 45) with no complications of arteriovenous fistulae for
      hemodialysis. The demographic structure, etiology of renal disease, biochemical
      parameters and concentration of D-dimer were analyzed at the beginning of the
      study and 1 year later, as well as the existence of tissue calcification and
      Duplex ultrasound parameters of the carotid artery. RESULTS: The patients with
      arteriovenous fistulae complications were significantly older (58.4 +/- 12.9 vs. 
      52.3 +/- 11.6 years; P = 0.026). High venous pressure (98.6 +/- 29.98 vs. 80 +/- 
      33.57 mmHg; P = 0.005) and soft-tissue calcification (P = 0.03) were correlated
      with the occurrence of arteriovenous fistula complications. The greatest risk for
      failure of fistula was within the first month after creation of the anastomosis
      (failure rate was 0.235). The hemoglobin concentration (89 +/- 14.0 vs. 96.6 +/- 
      17.7 g/l; P = 0.048) was lower, and concentration of D-dimer at the end of the
      study was higher (219.56 +/- 193.05 vs. 332.03 +/- 149.48; P = 0.012) in patients
      with vascular access complications. By Cox regression analysis, the concentration
      of fibrin D-dimer at the end of the study was shown to be a significant predictor
      of fistula survival (beta = 0.002; P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Complications of
      arteriovenous fistulae were more often recorded in older patients. The greatest
      risk for fistula functioning was within the first month after creation of the
      anastomosis. Vein pressure and anemia were important indicators of arteriovenous 
      fistula complications. D-dimer was a significant marker of arteriovenous fistula 
      thrombosis.

TI  - Carotid intima media thickness and aortic calcification index closely relate to
      cerebro- and cardiovascular disorders in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 48-51; discussion 51-2
LID - 10.1111/j.1442-2042.2007.01925.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: Atherosclerosis can be evaluated by carotid intima media thickness (IMT),
      the aortic calcification index (ACI), and pulse wave velocity (PWV). We
      investigated which test was most closely related to cerebro- and cardiovascular
      disorders (CCVD) in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Maximum IMT (max-IMT), ACI,
      and PWV were examined in 110 hemodialysis patients, using carotid
      ultrasonography, abdominal CT and a blood pressure pulse wave instrument,
      respectively. Blood hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum total cholesterol, high density
      lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, total protein, albumin, high sensitivity C
      reactive protein (hs-CRP), and tumor necrosis factor alpha were measured. The
      patients were divided into two groups; with and without CCVD and the degree of
      atherosclerosis was evaluated in each group. RESULTS: Compared to the CCVD (-)
      group, the CCVD (+) group showed significantly higher percentages of males and
      diabetic patients, higher levels of HbA1c (5.14 vs 4.83%) and hs-CRP (0.320 vs
      0.167 mg/dL), an older age group (64.5 vs 57.5 years), a greater max-IMT (2.05 vs
      1.19 mm), and a higher ACI (71.8 vs 41.0%); and significantly lower diastolic
      blood pressure (82.8 vs 89.2 mmHg). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed 
      that the factors influencing the development of CCVD were age (odds ratio:
      1.092), ACI (odds ratio: 1.025), and max-IMT (odds ratio: 2.006). However, PWV
      did not significantly relate to CCVD. CONCLUSIONS: In hemodialysis patients, the 
      ACI and max-IMT were significantly associated with CCVD, but the association of
      PWV was weak. A prospective cohort study is warranted to determine the risk
      factors for CCVD in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients undergoing peritoneal
      dialysis.
PG  - S205-9
AB  - Patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) are at high cardiovascular risk. Although
      some risk factors are unmodifiable (for example, age, sex, genetics), others are 
      exacerbated in the unfriendly uremic milieu (inflammation, oxidative stress,
      mineral disturbances) or contribute per se to kidney disease and cardiovascular
      progression (diabetes mellitus, hypertension). Moreover, several factors
      associated with PD therapy may both increase (by altered lipid profile,
      hyperinsulinemia, and formation of advanced glycation end-products) and decrease 
      (by better blood pressure control and anemia management) cardiovascular risk. The
      present review discusses recent findings and therapy trends in cardiovascular
      research on the PD population, with emphasis on the roles of inflammation,
      insulin resistance, homocysteinemia, dyslipidemia, vascular calcification, and
      genetics/epigenetics.

TI  - Significant association between the presence of peripheral vascular calcification
      and lower serum magnesium in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 222-7
AB  - AIM: Vascular calcification, which significantly increases cardiovascular and
      other causes of mortality, is highly prevalent in hemodialysis patients. The aim 
      of the present study was to examine the association between serum magnesium
      levels and vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: 390
      nondiabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis (226 males and 164 females, 59
      +/- 13 years) were examined. Hand roentgenography was performed in each patient, 
      and visible vascular calcification of the hand arteries was evaluated. Blood was 
      drawn to measure serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium and intact parathyroid
      hormone levels. RESULTS: There were 52 patients (38 males and 14 females) with
      vascular calcification, and 338 (188 males and 150 females) without. Serum
      phosphate was significantly higher in the former compared with the latter group
      (p < 0.005); serum intact parathyroid hormone was significantly higher (p <
      0.05), whereas serum calcium was not statistically different between the two
      groups. Serum magnesium was significantly lower in patients with vascular
      calcification than in those without (2.69 +/- 0.28 vs. 2.78 +/- 0.33 mg/dl, p <
      0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that serum magnesium
      concentration was a significant independent factor associated with the presence
      of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients (odds ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 
      - 0.92/1 mg/dl increase in serum magnesium, p = 0.036) after adjustment for age, 
      gender, duration of hemodialysis, calcium, phosphate and intact parathyroid
      hormone concentrations. CONCLUSION: Hypomagnesemia is significantly associated
      with the presence of vascular calcification of the hand arteries, independent of 
      serum calcium and phosphate levels. These results suggest that higher serum
      magnesium concentrations may play an important protective role in the development
      of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients, and that magnesium
      concentration of dialysis fluid may be reconsidered in view of preventing
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Progressive vascular calcification over 2 years is associated with arterial
      stiffening and increased mortality in patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney
      disease.
PG  - 1241-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is increasingly recognized as
      an important component of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease. The
      objective of this study was to investigate prospectively the determinants,
      cardiovascular functional consequences, and survival associated with vascular
      calcification over 24 mo. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total 
      of 134 patients (60 on hemodialysis, 28 on peritoneal dialysis, and 46 with stage
      4 chronic kidney disease) were studied. Vascular calcification of the superficial
      femoral artery was assessed using multislice spiral computed tomography; pulse
      wave velocity; all medications and time-averaged biochemical parameters were
      recorded at baseline and 12 and 24 mo. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients remained 
      at 24 mo. Progressive calcification was seen in 58 of 101 patients. Most (31 of
      46) patients with an initial calcification score of zero did not develop
      calcification. The hemodialysis group demonstrated a greater degree of
      progression than patients who were on peritoneal dialysis or had stage 4 chronic 
      kidney disease. Progressive calcification was associated with age, male gender,
      serum alkaline phosphatase, beta blockers, and lipid-lowering agents. Increases
      in vascular calcification correlated with increased arterial stiffness. Vascular 
      calcification was present in 20 of 21 patients who died. Cox proportional hazard 
      analysis identified change in calcification score, calcium intake from phosphate 
      binders, and low albumin as risk factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease and preexisting vascular calcification
      exhibit significantly increased calcification over 24 mo. Rapid progression of
      calcification is associated with arterial stiffness and mortality.

TI  - Undercarboxylated matrix GLA protein levels are decreased in dialysis patients
      and related to parameters of calcium-phosphate metabolism and aortic augmentation
      index.
PG  - 395-401
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications are related to cardiovascular mortality and
      morbidity in dialysis patients. Limited data exist on the role of calcification
      inhibitors, such as matrix-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP) in dialysis
      patients. METHODS: In 120 dialysis patients and 41 age-matched healthy controls, 
      circulating undercarboxylated (uc) MGP levels were measured with a novel
      ELISA-based competitive assay. The association between ucMGP levels and
      determinants of bone mineral metabolism, including the calcification inhibitor
      fetuin-A, was studied. Moreover, the relation between ucMGP levels and arterial
      stiffness was investigated. RESULTS: The ucMGP level was significantly lower in
      dialysis patients compared to controls (173 +/- 70 vs. 424 +/- 126 nmol/l; p <
      0.0001). After adjustment for age, sex and duration of dialysis an independent
      negative association between time-averaged phosphate levels [regression
      coefficient beta with 95% confidence interval = -64 (-107 to -21)] and a positive
      association between serum ucMGP and fetuin-A [131 (55-208)] was observed.
      Duration of dialysis was inversely correlated with ucMGP (r = -0.24, p = 0.007). 
      ucMGP levels were not related to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or
      time-averaged calcium levels. After adjustment for age, sex, cardiovascular
      disease, diabetes, height and mean arterial pressure, ucMGP level was negatively 
      associated with the aortic augmentation index [-0.036 (-0.061 to -0.010)] but not
      with pulse wave velocity or pulse pressure. CONCLUSION: Significantly lower serum
      ucMGP levels were observed in dialysis patients compared to healthy controls.
      ucMGP levels were inversely associated with phosphate and positively associated
      with serum fetuin-A levels. Furthermore, ucMGP levels were inversely associated
      with the aortic augmentation index. These data suggest that low ucMGP levels may 
      be a marker of active calcification.

TI  - Impact of ENPP1 genotype on arterial calcification in patients with end-stage
      renal failure.
PG  - 321-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1) generates 
      inorganic pyrophosphate, a solute that serves as an essential physiological
      inhibitor of calcification. Inactivating mutations of ENPP1 are associated with
      generalized arterial calcification of infancy. We hypothesized the ENPP1 K121Q
      variant to be associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with
      end-stage renal failure. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited 79 patients with
      end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis treatment and genotyped them for the 
      ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism. Next, we matched to each patient with ENPP1 121KQ
      genotype (n=15) a respective control with ENPP1 121KK genotype by gender, age,
      diabetes and duration of dialysis treatment. The matching ratio was 1:1. Severity
      of coronary calcification was quantified by computed tomography, and aortic
      stiffness was measured by pulse-wave analysis. RESULTS: Patients with ENPP1 121KQ
      genotype had a significantly higher coronary calcium score (1385 vs 94; n=30;
      P=0.033), and also a higher aortic pulse-wave velocity when compared to matched
      controls with ENPP1 121KK genotype (13.69 m/s vs 9.37 m/s; P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS:
      Taken together, our study suggests a potential role of the ENPP1 K121Q
      polymorphism in arterial calcification of patients with end-stage renal failure. 
      Patients heterozygous for the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism have higher coronary
      calcification scores and increased aortic stiffness, and may benefit from more
      intense treatment in order to prevent progression of arterial calcification.

TI  - Atherosclerosis of radial and internal thoracic arteries used in coronary bypass:
      atherosclerosis in arterial grafts.
PG  - 385-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the degree and incidence of
      atherosclerosis in internal thoracic (ITA) and radial arteries (RA) harvested for
      coronary bypass grafting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The association of major
      clinical events and etiological factors for atherosclerosis was investigated in
      770 arterial segments obtained prospectively from 480 patients. Potential risk
      factors for atherosclerosis were age, gender, smoking, diabetes mellitus,
      peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal failure,
      hypercholesterolemia, obesity, hypertension, and a positive family history.
      RESULTS: Six types of histological lesions have been defined; grade III or more
      was present in the RA in 47 (16%) patients and in the ITA in 30 (7%). The mean
      grade was 1.6 +/- 0.6 in the ITA and 2.1 +/- 0.9 in the RA (p < 0.001).
      CONCLUSION: RA had a significantly greater prevalence of atherosclerosis than the
      same patients' ITA. There was a strong correlation between ITA atherosclerosis
      and age. The presence of calcification may lead surgeons to avoid an extra
      incision according to risk factors, although most of these are not predictive.

TI  - Pulse wave velocity--a useful tool for cardiovascular surveillance in
      pre-dialysis patients.
PG  - 3527-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular mortality is high among patients with chronic kidney
      disease. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a simple method used for arterial
      distensibility evaluation. Few data are available concerning PWV in pre-dialysis 
      patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between PWV and
      cardiovascular disease in pre-dialysis. METHODS: One hundred and four patients
      were submitted to PWV analysis, coronary artery calcium (CAC) determination with 
      a multi-slice CT scan of the coronary arteries, echocardiogram and a carotid
      intima-media thickness (IMT) evaluation, with a high resolution ultrasound. The
      demographic characteristics and laboratory tests results were studied. RESULTS:
      The mean age of those studied was 54.4 +/- 11.5 years, 60% were males and the
      mean creatinine clearance was 40 ml/min/1.73 m(2). The mean PWV was 12.2 +/- 3.4 
      m/s and it was significantly higher in males, diabetics, those with creatinine
      clearance <60 ml/min and proteinuria > or =1 g/24 h. PWV was correlated with
      systolic blood pressure, age, triglycerides, total cholesterol and 24 h
      proteinuria. In the multiple regression analysis, PWV was significantly
      associated with diabetes, age, systolic blood pressure and cholesterol.
      Fifty-eight patients (56%) presented coronary calcification and PWV correlated
      with coronary calcium score (R = 0.48; P < 0.001) and calcium volume (R = 0.50; P
      < 0.001). Moreover, PWV was higher in patients with coronary calcification (13.4 
      +/- 3.6 m/s vs 10.7 +/- 2.4 m/s; P < 0.001). The mean left ventricular mass index
      (LVMI) was 106 +/- 31 g/m(2) and 24% of patients had left ventricular
      hypertrophy, while 19 (18.3%) patients had left ventricular dysfunction. PVW was 
      correlated with LVMI (R = 0.25; P = 0.01) while no association could be seen
      between PWV and the ejection fraction or left ventricular dysfunction. A
      correlation between the IMT and PWV was observed (R = 0.27; P = 0.005). In
      addition, those with a thicker IMT had a higher PWV (13.2 +/- 3.4 m/s vs 11. 2
      +/- 3.2 m/s; P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: PWV is associated with cardiovascular
      disease in pre-dialysis patients and can be a useful tool to identify patients
      with increased cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Calcification of coronary intima and media: immunohistochemistry, backscatter
      imaging, and x-ray analysis in renal and nonrenal patients.
PG  - 121-34
AB  - Coronary calcification is a potent predictor of cardiac events. In patients with 
      chronic renal disease, both prevalence and intensity of coronary calcification
      are increased. It has remained uncertain whether it is the intima of the
      coronaries or the media that is calcified and whether the morphologic details of 
      calcified plaques differ between renal and nonrenal patients. Autopsy samples of 
      coronaries were obtained from standard sites in 23 renal and 23 age- and
      gender-matched nonuremic patients. Specimens were examined using light and
      electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, backscatter imaging, and x-ray
      analysis. In coronaries, calcified plaques occupied a similar proportion of the
      intima area in renal versus nonrenal patients (17.3 +/- 11.9 versus 18.1 +/-
      11.9%) but occupied a significantly higher proportion of the media (16.6 +/- 10.6
      versus 3.8 +/- 2.31%). Expression of the proteins osteocalcin, C-reactive
      protein, TGF-beta, and collagen IV was significantly more intensive around
      coronary plaques of renal compared with nonrenal patients. The non-plaque-bearing
      intima of renal patients showed minimal staining for fetuin, but fetuin staining 
      was seen surrounding calcified plaques. In addition, more pronounced deposition
      of C5b-9 was found around coronary plaques of renal patients, and glycophorin
      deposition pointed to more past intraplaque hemorrhage in renal patients.
      Calcification by electron backscatter analysis is more intense in the coronary
      media, but not if the intima is more intense in renal compared with nonrenal
      patients. A more marked inflammatory response in renal patients is suggested by
      more frequent presence and greater intensity of markers of inflammation.

TI  - [Limitation on efficacy of sirolimus-eluting stent implantation in patients on
      hemodialysis].
PG  - 331-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients receiving chronic hemodialysis develop complicated coronary 
      lesions with tortuosity and calcification, which make stent delivery or expansion
      difficult. Restenosis rates are also higher than in patients without
      hemodialysis. Furthermore, there is a risk of polymer rubbing from the surface of
      a sirolimus-eluting stent(SES)placed across a calcified lesion. This study
      investigated the efficacy of SES for patients on hemodialysis compared with bare 
      metal stent (BMS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-two patients on hemodialysis
      underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for 46 de novo lesions treated with 
      SES (SES group). Seventy-four patients with 78 de novo lesions were treated with 
      BMS (BMS group). The mean age was 65.8 +/- 9.3 yr in the SES group, and 65.0 +/- 
      8.7 yr in the BMS group. The mean hemodialysis period was significantly longer in
      the SES group (9.2 +/- 7.9 vs 6.5 +/- 7.7 yr, p < 0.01). Angiographic
      characteristics and acute results showed no significant difference between the
      two groups. At 6 months follow-up, late loss was significantly smaller in the SES
      group (0.60 +/- 0.97 vs 1.60 +/- 1.15 mm, p < 0.05). Binary restenosis and target
      lesion revascularization were similar (34% vs 43%, 25% vs 36%, respectively, p = 
      NS). Major adverse cardiac events, composite of death, myocardial infarction, and
      target vessel revascularization were also similar (23% vs 36%, p = NS).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study could not demonstrate the superiority of SES implantation 
      in patients with hemodialysis compared to BMS implantation, which suggests the
      limitations of using SES.

TI  - Detection of coronary and peripheral artery calcification in patients with
      chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4, with and without diabetes.
PG  - 3208-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence and extent
      of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) stages 3 and 4 comparing those with and without diabetes. We also wished to
      determine if the presence of peripheral artery calcification (PAC) would assist
      in identifying patients positive for CAC. METHODS: CAC was detected by
      multi-slice computed tomography and PAC was detected by plain foot radiography.
      Study population was 112 patients, 54 with diabetes and 58 without, all
      asymptomatic for heart disease. Demographic and laboratory data were collected
      and analysed. RESULTS: The prevalence of CAC in CKD patients was 76 and 46.5%
      with and without diabetes, respectively. Patients with diabetes had higher CAC
      scores with more vessels affected, and in the presence of diabetes men and women 
      had the same risk for CAC. In patients with diabetes, age was the unique
      explanatory variable for detecting the presence of CAC, while age and smoking
      history predicted severity. In patients without diabetes, age, male gender, body 
      mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate and serum phosphate levels
      predicted the presence of CAC, while parathyroid hormone predicted severity.
      Prevalence of PAC was 63 and 12% in subjects with and without diabetes. PAC
      detected by foot radiography was not an adequate alternative-screening marker for
      identifying patients with CAC. CONCLUSIONS: CAC is common in CKD stages 3 and 4
      patients, especially in men and women with diabetes.

      augmentation index (Aix), and vascular calcification have been associated with an
      unfavourable cardiovascular outcome in hemodialysis patients. However, the
      majority of data have been published in white patients and epidemiological data
      are discordant on the fate of patients of different races. In this cross
      sectional study we measured PWV and Aix by applanation tonometry and coronary
      artery and thoracic aorta calcium score (CAC and AoC) by electron beam tomography
      (EBT) in 81 Blacks and 61 Whites on maintenance hemodialysis. Vascular stiffness 
      measurements and EBT scans were performed within a week of each other. There was 
      no difference between races in age, systolic blood pressure or gender
      distribution. Blacks had a more frequent history of hypertension (100% versus
      89%; P=0.002), lower prevalence of dyslipidemia (30% versus 66%; P<0.001), higher
      PTH levels (geometric mean 607 pg/ml versus 245 pg/ml; P=0.039), received calcium
      based phosphate binders less frequently (37% versus 60%, P=0.007) and calcium
      antagonists more frequently than Whites (54% versus 28%; P=0.003). Nonetheless,
      the unadjusted and risk adjusted PWV and Aix, as well as CAC and AoC were not
      statistically different between races. In this dialysis cohort there was no
      difference in markers of vasculopathy between black and white patients despite
      differences in baseline clinical characteristics. Epidemiological data from the
      general population indicate that Blacks have lower calcium scores and stiffer
      vessels than Whites. Some studies in the renal populations suggest a better and
      others a similar survival of Blacks and Whites on hemodialysis. Our findings
      raise the important question of the prognostic significance of markers of
      vasculopathy in patients of different races and with different risk profiles.

TI  - Carotid artery calcification on multislice detector-row computed tomography.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the underlying conditions that affect the degree of
      calcification of carotid arterial plaques, measured quantitatively using
      multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT), and to study the association of
      carotid calcification with clinical symptomatology. METHODS: We measured the
      calcification volume of stenotic lesions at the carotid bifurcation using MDCT in
      84 consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo carotid revascularization. 
      These results were compared with the clinical and radiological characteristics of
      the patients. RESULTS: On MDCT, calcification in the carotid plaques was present 
      in 78 patients (93%). Compared to the other patients, patients in the highest
      quartile of calcification volume (quartile 4) had higher serum creatinine levels 
      (p < 0.001) and tended to have fewer symptomatic ischemic events in the territory
      of the affected carotid artery in the preceding 6 months (29 vs. 49%, p = 0.099);
      in particular, there were fewer transient symptoms (5 vs. 27%, p = 0.032) and
      symptoms possibly occurring due to local embolism (14 vs. 37%, p = 0.045). On
      ultrasound, plaque ulceration was less prevalent in patients in quartile 4 than
      in the remaining patients (5 vs. 29%, p = 0.026), although the severity of
      carotid stenosis was similar among all the quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: Renal
      dysfunction was associated with enhanced carotid plaque calcification. Patients
      with severe carotid calcification were found to have a low risk of recent
      ischemic stroke, presumably due, in part, to a lower prevalence of emboligenic
      carotid ulceration. MDCT was valuable for the quantitative evaluation of carotid 
      calcification.

TI  - Prevalence and determinants of coronary and aortic calcifications assessed by
      chest CT in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 329-35
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcifications independently predict cardiovascular
      events (CVE) in the general population. We assessed the prevalence and
      determinants of coronary (CAC) and thoracic aorta (AoC) calcifications in renal
      transplant recipients (RTR). METHODS: Consecutive RTR living in Belgium, with an 
      isolated kidney graft functioning for more than 1 year, were asked to
      participate. They underwent a 16-slice spiral computerized tomography in order to
      measure calcium mass. Demographic, clinical, biochemical and urinary parameters
      were recorded. RESULTS: We included 281 patients. CAC and AoC were detected in 81
      and 85%, with geometric means (SD) of 52.2 (4.9) and 99.3 (8.2) mg, respectively.
      By multiple linear regression, independent predictors of both types of
      calcifications included older age, longer time on dialysis, a history of CVE, of 
      multiple transplantations and of smoking. Other determinants of CAC were male
      gender, current statin use and history of parathyroidectomy, and other
      determinants of AoC included higher pulse pressure, shorter time under
      mycophenolate mofetil and current use of anti-vitamin-K. CONCLUSION: The
      prevalence of both CAC and AoC is substantial in RTR. We delineate independent
      determinants either common to both CAC and AoC or specific to one, and known as
      classic or chronic kidney disease related risk factors.
