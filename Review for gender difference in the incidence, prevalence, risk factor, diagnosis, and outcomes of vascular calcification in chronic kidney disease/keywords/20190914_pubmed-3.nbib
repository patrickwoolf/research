TI  - An evaluation of fluoroscopy time and correlation with outcomes after
      percutaneous coronary intervention.
PG  - 208-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated short-term prognosis and resource utilization of
      consecutive patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as a
      function of fluoroscopy time. BACKGROUND: Advances in interventional cardiology
      are reflected in the growing complexity of PCI leading to an increasing use of
      fluoroscopic guidance. The relationship between fluoroscopy time and in-hospital 
      outcomes after PCI has not been addressed. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis
      of a prospectively collected database including a total of 9,650 patients, the
      mean fluoroscopy time was 18.3 +/- 12.2 minutes. Outcomes were stratified by
      fluoroscopy time. RESULTS: Compared to patients within the 75th percentile, those
      with prolonged fluoroscopy time were older and had a higher prevalence of prior
      coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral
      arterial disease, type B2/C lesions, and baseline TIMI flow 0-2. Patients with
      prolonged fluoroscopy time had higher rates of in-hospital death (3.3% vs. 0.3%; 
      p <0.0001), emergent CABG (2.1% vs. 0.3%; p = 0.0001), stent thrombosis (2.9% vs.
      1.3%; p = 0.17), retroperitoneal hematoma (0.9% vs. 0.2%; p = 0.01), and
      contrast-induced nephropathy (6.7% vs. 4.5%; p = 0.03). Resource utilization was 
      significantly higher (p <0.0001) in patients with prolonged fluoroscopy time. By 
      multivariate analysis, prolonged fluoroscopy time was most strongly associated
      with prior CABG (OR = 2.39), ostial lesion (OR = 2.87), severe lesion
      calcification (OR = 2.14), baseline TIMI flow 0-2 (OR = 3.71) (all p <0.0001),
      lesion eccentricity (OR = 1.96; p = 0.0063), and peripheral arterial disease (OR 
      = 1.91; p = 0.0068). CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged fluoroscopy time is associated with
      higher complexity of treated lesions and increased rates of periprocedural
      complications including early mortality, emergent CABG, contrast-induced
      nephropathy, and increased resource utilization.

TI  - Electron-beam computerized tomography correlates with coronary angiogram in
      chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Electron-beam computerized tomography (EBCT) is able to
      noninvasively quantify coronary artery calcification (CAC). Chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) patients frequently have CAC, and clinicians are puzzled regarding 
      the clinical significance of this finding and the diagnostic accuracy of coronary
      EBCT in CKD. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation in CKD
      patients between CAC measured by EBCT and 50% stenosis determined by coronary
      angiography (CA), the gold standard to identify atherosclerotic lesions. METHOD: 
      We recruited 37 patients with CKD from a single institution and compared their
      coronary EBCT and CA results using standard statistical analysis. RESULTS:
      Patients with at least one vessel with > or = 50% stenosis by CA had higher mean 
      CAC scores [2,407.9 +/- (SD) 3,165.3 vs. 227 +/- 443.4; p < 0.001] and higher
      median CAC scores (1,052 vs. 25.8; p < 0.001) as compared with those having no
      stenosis > or = 50%. The sensitivity was 85.7%, and the specificity 82.6% using
      50% stenosis as the definition for coronary artery disease and using a CAC score 
      of 400 as a cutoff value for the EBCT results. The area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve was 0.84. The diagnostic accuracy (proportion of
      correct results) was 83.8%. The negative predictive value was 90.5%. The receiver
      operating characteristic curve suggests that the optimal cutoff value for CAC
      scores in our cohort is 315.9, increasing the area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve to 0.91. The total coronary artery stenosis was
      significantly associated with the CAC score (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: EBCT has a
      very good predictive value for obstructive coronary artery disease. EBCT could be
      used as a screening tool in CKD patients with a low-to-intermediate risk for
      coronary artery disease.

TI  - Serum levels of calcification inhibition proteins and coronary artery calcium
      score: comparison between transplantation and dialysis.
PG  - 75-83
AB  - Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of both
      divalent ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to possible biochemical 
      differences between dialysis (D) and transplantation (Tx), we examined the entity
      and severity of these biochemical modifications and of coronary artery calcium
      score separately in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard markers
      of inflammation, divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin, matrix Gla protein
      (MGP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients (age 45 +/- 12 years; 30
      males, 21 females; previous D duration 4.8 +/- 4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 +/- 5.5
      years; Cr 1.8 +/- 0.6 mg/dl) and in 49 D patients (age 49 +/- 14 years; 30
      males,19 females; D duration 5.6 +/- 4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium
      score (AS) was evaluated by cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx 
      patients had better values of divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower
      prevalence (65 vs. 86%; p < 0.02) and severity (AS = 570 +/- 1,637 vs. 1,311 +/- 
      3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary calcification. In addition, a tendency toward
      normalization for all of the three calcification inhibitory proteins was evident.
      In both Tx and D, AS correlated with age and OPG (Tx: r(s) = 0.439, p < 0.001,
      and r(s) = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: r(s) = 0.471, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.403, p <
      0.005, respectively); in D patients, a correlation was present also with D
      duration (r(s) = 0.435; p < 0.002), other markers of inflammation and, notably,
      fetuin (r(s) = -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression analysis selected previous time on 
      D in Tx patients (r(m) = 0.400; p < 0.004), and C-reactive protein and OPG in D
      patients (r(m) = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most predictive parameters of AS.
      Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age and D duration in the
      appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct risk condition. At
      variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS. In conclusion, as compared to
      D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of calcification inhibition proteins and
      of divalent ions closer to normal. As this is associated with a lower prevalence 
      and severity of AS, it is suggested that Tx antagonize the accelerating role of D
      in the progression of vascular calcification. Assessment of both coronary
      calcifications and serum levels of calcification inhibitory proteins may be of
      value to identify those subjects at higher risk of development and progression of
      vascular lesions, among whom males have the highest rate.

      dialysis patients].
PG  - 314-20
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in peritoneal dialysed
      patients (PD-pts). Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is likely to affect the
      development of CVD. Purpose of our study was to evaluate coronary artery
      calcification and risk factors of this calcification in PD-pts. We studied 62
      patients (38 F, 24 M) undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Coronary calcification
      was examined by ECG-gated multidetector CT (Light Speed Ultra) using Agatson (AG)
      and volumetric (V) methods. Patients were divided into 3 groups depending on mean
      value of estimated CAC: group A-no calcification, group B-CAC maximal value 400
      mm3, group C-CAC value more than 400 mm3. As risk factors of CAC were evaluated: 
      patients age, sex, dialysis duration, serum concentration of Ca, P, homocysteine 
      CRP and fibrinogen, as well as, CaxP product, intact PTH; presence of diabetes or
      hypertension. Coronary artery calcification was detected in 68% of patients. In
      the whole observed population positive correlation between CAC determined by AG
      and V methods and CRP (r = 0.36, p < 0.05) as well as patients age (r = 0.5, p < 
      0.01) was observed. There was also positive correlation between CAC and
      fibrinogen concentration (AG CAC r = 0.58, p < 0.05; V CAC r = 0.72, p < 0.05).
      When compared group C with the groups A and B cardiovascular complications were
      in this group more frequent than in the last two: 4 patients from group C died
      because of cardiovascular complications.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerosis is more frequent in patients with chronic renal
      insufficiency than in general population. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the frequency of atherosclerosis and risk factors in hemodialysis
      patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 62 patients (36 male and 26 female;
      mean age, 56 +/- 13 years). The mean time on HD was 65.7 +/- 46.7 months. These
      patient underwent the following examinations: assessments of risk factors, body
      mass index, soft tissue calcification biochemical analyses and Duplex
      ultrasonography of carotid arteries; RESULTS: In two thirds of patients older
      than fifty years, thickening of the intima-media complex was found. No
      statistically significant difference was found in the frequency of
      atherosclerosis regarding sex, tissue calcification, plaque, smoking and Diabetes
      Mellitus. There was no correlation between the thickness of the intima-media
      complex and traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis. However, there was a
      statistically significant correlation among atherosclerosis, age and time on
      dialysis. Atherosclerosis was found in 68% of patients between the age of fifty
      and seventy years. Duration of dialysis and age are statistically significant
      factors for atherosclerosis.

TI  - Bone mineral density in children with chronic renal failure.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - Bone mineral density (BMD) is important in children and adolescents because of
      its relationship to long-term skeletal health, and because, in adults with
      chronic renal failure (CRF), a relationship between low BMD and vascular
      calcification has been suggested. To investigate the relationship between BMD and
      manipulable factors that might affect it, i.e. plasma calcium, phosphate and
      parathyroid hormone (PTH), 64 patients with a median glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR) of 31 (range 7-60) ml min(-1) 1.73 m(-2) and median age of 10.0 (4.1-16.9) 
      years were followed over 1.3 (0.7-1.7) years at an average of 5 (3-14) clinic
      visits. At one visit, BMD of the lumbar spine was measured by dual energy X-ray
      absorptiometry. The mean BMD Z-score was normal (=0.0). Overall mean calcium,
      phosphate and PTH levels were in their respective normal ranges. The majority of 
      the patients (72%) were treated with calcium carbonate, mean dose 65 mg kg(-1)
      day(-1); prescription was positively related to serum calcium levels and
      calcium-phosphate product (P=0.012 and P<0.01 respectively). Almost all patients 
      (98%) were treated with alfacalcidol, mean dose 12 ng kg(-1) day(-1);
      prescription was not related to investigated factors. Patients grew well; there
      was no change in height standard deviation score (DeltaHtSDS=0.0). Normal BMD
      Z-score for age and sex can be achieved in children with CRF managed with the aim
      of maintaining normal PTH levels by dietary phosphate restriction, calcium-based 
      phosphate binders and small doses of alfacalcidol. Further investigation of the
      underlying bone by the use of biopsy and histomorphometry is required to
      determine actual bone health.

TI  - Cardiac vascular calcification and QT interval in ESRD patients: is there a link?
PG  - 451-9
AB  - We will present our experience and our preliminary data about the correlation
      between cardiac calcification and QT interval (and QT dispersion) in uraemia. We 
      studied 32 haemodialysis (HD) patients (age 69 +/- 16 years, time on dialysis 32 
      +/- 27 months) and 12 chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD-4) patients (age 66 +/-
      17 years, uraemia duration 38 +/- 16 months). The patients were characterized by 
      a good mineral control, as shown by serum phosphate levels (3.6 +/- 1.3 mg/dl in 
      CKD-4 and 4.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl in HD patients) and Ca x P product (46 +/- 17 and 49 
      +/- 16 mg(2)/dl(2), respectively). The parathyroid hormone levels were higher in 
      HD than CKD-4 patients (p < 0.0001). A TC score >400 was found to be highly
      prevalent in both groups. Significantly more HD patients (62.5%) showed cardiac
      calcification than CKD-4 patients (33%; p = 0.01). The patients were matched for 
      TC scores higher or lower than 400. The two groups differed by gender (p < 0.05),
      age (p = 0.026), frequency of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), uraemia follow-up
      period (p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (p = 0.009), Ca x P
      product (p = 0.002), parathyroid hormone level (p < 0.0001), and corrected QT
      dispersion (p < 0.0001). The QT interval was higher in HD and CKD-4 patients with
      higher TC scores (approximately 11%), but QT interval dispersion was
      significantly higher in patients with TC scores >400. QT dispersion showed a
      linear correlation with TC scores in both groups (r = 0.899 and p < 0.0001 and r 
      = 0.901 and p < 0.0001). Male gender, age, time (months) of uraemia, low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin, calcium x phosphorus product, parathyroid
      hormone, and TC score are important determinants of QT dispersion. Our data show 
      that it is possible to link dysrhythmias and cardiac calcification in uraemic
      patients.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of cardiovascular calcium in chronic kidney disease
      (from the Prospective Longitudinal RRI-CKD Study).
PG  - 571-6
AB  - Although the determinants of cardiovascular calcium have been well described in
      dialysis patients, the prevalence and predictors in predialysis chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) are less known. One hundred six patients with CKD from the Renal
      Research Institute-CKD Study underwent multidetector computed tomography for the 
      assessment of calcium deposition at the level of coronary arteries, thoracic
      aorta, aortic valve, and mitral valve. Cardiovascular risk factors and renal
      function-related parameters (glomerular filtration rate, glomerular filtration
      rate slope, serum creatinine, serum urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, albumin, calcium, 
      phosphate, and parathyroid hormone) were included in multivariate regression
      models to predict cardiovascular calcium. Prevalences of calcium deposition at
      the level of coronary arteries, thoracic aorta, aortic valve, and mitral valve
      were 69%, 46%, 39%, and 16%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, coronary
      artery calcium score was predicted by age (p < 0.0001), gender (p = 0.0001),
      diabetes (p = 0.024), and history of coronary artery disease (p = 0.016), but not
      by renal function related parameters. Similarly, renal function related
      parameters were not predictive of aortic or valvular calcium. In conclusion,
      predialysis CKD is associated with a high prevalence of cardiovascular calcium.
      The extent of cardiovascular calcium in patients with predialysis CKD is related 
      to some of the traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis but not to indexes of
      abnormal renal function or progression in renal dysfunction.

TI  - Vascular calcification and renal osteodystrophy relationship in chronic kidney
      disease.
PG  - 51-62
AB  - Cardiovascular disease and stroke account for 60-70% of all deaths in patients
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), at a risk that is 10-20-fold the age- and
      sex-matched general population. There is also increased coronary artery
      calcification and increased cardiovascular mortality in chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) and dialysis patients compared with the general population. Bone is
      similarly abnormal in CKD. There is an increased incidence of low bone mass and
      fractures in dialysis patients compared with the general population. Furthermore,
      a hip fracture in a dialysis patient is associated with a doubling of the
      mortality observed in nondialysis patients with a hip fracture. These two
      problems may be linked, as cross-sectional studies have demonstrated an inverse
      relationship between osteoporosis and coronary artery calcification in the
      general population and in ESRD patients. In vitro and ex vivo, there is clear
      evidence that vascular calcification is an active cell-mediated process, made
      worse by disorders of mineral metabolism. Many factors known to be associated
      with cardiovascular disease in CKD patients can directly increase calcification
      in vitro. In addition, in CKD, there are many mechanisms by which bone may
      adversely affect vascular calcification including disorders of bone remodelling, 
      altered secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), hyperphosphatemia,
      hypercalcaemia, use of calcium based binders, and excessive vitamin D therapy.
      The coexistence of vascular risk factors and abnormal bone represent a double
      threat to the well being of patients with CKD.

TI  - Accelerated vascular calcification and relative hypoparathyroidism in incident
      haemodialysis diabetic patients receiving calcium binders.
PG  - 3215-22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification and low bone turnover with a relatively low
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) often coexist in diabetic patients undergoing
      haemodialysis. Since calcium salts (CaS) are used extensively as primary
      phosphate binders and have been associated with progressive vascular
      calcification, we studied the effects of CaS on coronary arteries and parathyroid
      activity in incident haemodialysis diabetic patients. METHODS: We measured the
      change in coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) with sequential electron beam
      computed tomography (EBCT) in 64 diabetic and 45 non-diabetic patients,
      randomized to CaS or sevelamer within 90 days of starting haemodialysis. CACS
      measurements were repeated after 6, 12 and 18 months. Serum intact PTH (iPTH),
      calcium and phosphorus were serially tested. RESULTS: During the study period,
      serum phosphate was similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Serum calcium 
      levels were similar at baseline (2.3+/-0.25 mmol/l for both) and increased
      significantly with CaS treatment (P<0.05) both in diabetic and non-diabetic
      patients but not with sevelamer. Diabetic patients treated with CaS showed a
      significantly greater CACS progression than sevelamer-treated patients (median
      increase 177 vs 27; P=0.05). During follow-up, diabetic patients receiving CaS
      were significantly more likely to develop serum iPTH values<16 pmol/l than
      diabetic patients treated with sevelamer (33% vs 6%, P=0.005) and had a lower
      mean iPTH level (24+/-16 vs 31+/-14 pmol/l; P=0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The management
      of hyperphosphataemia with CaS in haemodialysis diabetic patients is associated
      with a significantly greater progression of CACS than with sevelamer. These
      effects are accompanied by iPTH changes suggestive of low bone turnover.

TI  - Cutaneous calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease: a regulated
      process associated with in situ osteopontin expression.
PG  - 900-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous calcification, or calcinosis cutis (CC), is found in
      approximately 1% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing
      chronic dialysis. While the pathogenesis is not well understood, it may be
      similar to those for medial and intimal vascular calcifications, which are
      actively regulated processes. OBSERVATION: In a retrospective study of 9
      patients, the role of an active calcification process leading to CC was assessed 
      by the immunohistochemical detection of osteopontin, which is a regulator of
      osseous and extra-osseous calcification processes. Calcinosis cutis was
      associated with female sex, vascular comorbidity, inconstant secondary
      hyperparathyroidism, and elevated levels of plasma calcium-phosphorus product.
      Six patients had a favorable outcome after the lowering of plasma calcium levels 
      during dialysis or after parathyroidectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Calcinosis of the
      vascular media of subcutaneous vessels was the most common histologic feature and
      was always associated with osteopontin staining, suggesting that CC is a
      regulated process. Moreover, to our knowledge, extravascular staining of
      osteopontin in sweat glands, nerves, and macrophages was demonstrated for the
      first time in this study.

TI  - Cardiac calcifications in hemodialysis patients assessed with spiral computed
      tomography.
PG  - 181-8
AB  - AIM: Cardiac disease is a major cause of mortality in uremic patients. The aim of
      this paper was to evaluate cardiac calcium content in uremic patients with
      multislice computed tomography (MSCT). METHODS: The study has been carried out on
      120 uremic and 28 nonuremic patients affected by cardiovascular disease. Serum
      calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphate product, intact PTH were assayed. Several 
      lipidic and nutritional parameters were measured. Calcification values obtained
      with the MSCT were reported in terms of Agatson scores. RESULTS: We found that
      the average score values in cohort on uremic was 10 times higher than in
      nonuremic patients (score values 3.389 vs 328). Cardiac calcification score was
      found to be correlated significantly to age (P=0.006), HD age (P=0.010), serum
      calcium (P=0.006), iPTH (P=0.004). Multiregression analysis (MRA) with the
      cardiac score as dependent variable selected the following variables (R(2)
      0.612): age (P=0.002), HD age (P=0.010), serum cholesterol (P<0.000),
      triglycerides (P=0.001) and inversely HDL cholesterol (P=0.001) and non-HDL
      cholesterol (P=0.001) as predictive variables for cardiac score. By comparing
      patients with scores lower and higher than 400, the group with score <400 showed 
      a significantly lower age (P=0.0001), HD vintage (P=0.01) and a significantly
      higher serum cholesterol (P=0.009), HDL cholesterol (P=0.05) and non-HDL
      cholesterol (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The MSCT could help in identifying and
      stratifying high-risk patients to implement preventive strategies. The control of
      mineral metabolism and of lipid levels is important in prevention of arterial
      calcification in uremic patients.

TI  - Cardiac calcifications: Fetuin-A and other risk factors in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 150-6
AB  - Cardiac calcifications are a frequent finding in hemodialysis for chronic renal
      failure. Several factors may play a role in the intimal and medial calcification 
      of coronary arteries such as age and some known atherogenetic factors. In
      addition, Fetuin-A has been proposed as a protective agent through solubilization
      of calcium phosphate salt. Fetuin-A is also a marker of inflammatory-nutritional 
      state, and its changes could be an expression of this condition. The aim of this 
      cross-sectional study is to evaluate the relative importance of risk factors of
      calcifications with special regard to Fetuin-A. The study was conducted with 132 
      hemodialysis patients. They were subjected to multislice computed tomography for 
      evaluation of calcium deposits in the heart. In addition, the patients were
      sampled for evaluation of calcium-phosphate parameters, lipid profile,
      nutritional and inflammatory markers, and also Fetuin-A. There was a wide
      variability of the extent of calcium deposits expressed as Agatston score, with
      only 9.3% of patients without calcifications. Age, hemodialysis age, sex,
      calcium-phosphate parameters, and lipid profile were important risk factors,
      together with nutritional and inflammatory status of the patients. An inverse
      correlation between coronary calcium score and Fetuin-A emerged from a multiple
      regression analysis. However, there was no significant difference in serum
      Fetuin-A among different grades of calcium score. By dividing the patients in
      tertiles of serum Fetuin-A, an association between low levels of Fetuin-A and
      high calcification score was found. Fetuin-A as dependent variable was strictly
      linked to prealbumin serum levels. In addition, there was a clear link between
      cardiac calcification scores and inflammatory-nutritional markers. Serum calcium 
      and treatment with calcitriol emerged as predictive variables of coronary
      score.Fetuin-A could be involved in the process of calcification both in the case
      of markedly low serum levels, due to decreased prevention of calcium phosphate
      precipitation, and also as a marker of inflammation, a well-known risk factor of 
      atherogenesis. Treatment with intravenous calcitriol could marginally enhance
      cardiac calcifications, probably through its hypercalcemic effect.

TI  - Inflammation, mineral metabolism and progressive coronary artery calcification in
      patients on haemodialysis.
PG  - 1915-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an extensive and common
      complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The aim of this
      study was to assess prospectively the change in CAC over a 2-year period and to
      identify the factors that may be associated with CAC progression in ESRD
      patients. METHODS: The final analysis was performed on 40 of 43 stable
      haemodialysis patients who initially entered into the study. The study population
      underwent multirow spiral computed tomography to derive CAC scores at baseline
      and after a minimum of 12 months (24 months in 30 patients, 18 months in four,
      and 12 months in the remaining six patients). To provide a stable estimate that
      was unbiased with respect to the baseline CAC, square root-transformed CAC scores
      were used for the analyses of the changes in CAC. RESULTS: The median CAC score
      was 191 (range, 0-2403) mm3 at baseline and increased to 253 (range, 0-2745) mm3 
      at follow-up (P < 0.001) and the median annualized change in square
      root-transformed CAC score was 1.48 (range, -0.95-8.64) mm3/year. The annualized 
      change of the square root-transformed CAC score positively correlated with the
      time-integrated levels of C-reactive protein (R = 0.521, P = 0.001), phosphorus
      (R = 0.433, P = 0.005) and calcium x phosphorus product (R = 0.394, P = 0.012),
      but did not correlate with the levels of fetuin-A or lipid parameters. Even after
      adjusting for age, gender and baseline CAC score, C-reactive protein levels were 
      independently associated with CAC progression. CONCLUSION: These data suggest
      that chronic inflammation as well as altered mineral metabolism contributes to a 
      rapid progression of CAC in ESRD patients. Additional, larger scale studies are
      required to confirm our findings.

TI  - [Cardiac failure and diastolic disfunction in hemodialysis patients: associated
      factors].
PG  - 668-77
AB  - UNLABELLED: Heart failure (CHF) and diastolic dysfuction (DD) relationship has
      received poor attention in hemodialysis patients (HD). OBJECTIVE: To analyse the 
      incidence of CHF in our HD patients, the relationship with DD and impact on
      mortality. METHODS: We studied 79 patients: 48 +/- 15 years old, mean time on HD 
      83 +/- 63 months. Vascular calcification (PVC) was evaluated by radiologic series
      (55.7%). We analyzed the presence of clinical and analytical cardiovascular
      factors. All patients underwent M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler
      echocardiography. Patients were followed for two years. Clinical information
      collected: incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD), CHF, and mortality due to
      cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Most frequent finding was Left Ventricular
      Hypertrophy (LVH) (93%), followed by DD (63.5% had anormal LV relaxation) (ALVR).
      Incidence of CHF was 38.3%; and was significantly associated with higher: time on
      HD (130/72 months), Ca x P (74/65), PTH (677/376), bone alkaline phosphatase
      (27/16), and systolic BP (145 vs 130 mmHg); IHD, PVC, valvular calcification
      (VC), LVH and ALVR (p < 0.01). Systolic function was normal in both groups
      (with/without CHF). Logistic regression identified as risk factors for CHF: ALVR 
      (OR: 9.5), IHD (OR: 15) and systolic BP (OR: 2.2). ALVR was associated with
      greater age (55/37), longer time on HD (76/60), PVC and VC (p < 0.001). Predictor
      factors identified were age (OR: 2.13) and PVC (OR: 3.9). CONCLUSIONS: HD
      patients showed a high incidence of CHF. IHD, systolic BP and DD (ALVR) have
      behave as risk factors for CHF. Vascular calcifications were intimately related
      to these findings and, therefore, they contribute to the greater mortality of
      these patients.

TI  - The natural history of coronary calcification progression in a cohort of
      nocturnal haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1407-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with a markedly
      increased cardiac calcification burden, as reflected by computed tomography scans
      of the heart. Nocturnal haemodialysis (NHD) is a novel form of renal replacement 
      therapy which has multiple physiologic effects that may affect vascular
      calcification, including improvements in phosphate and uraemia control. The
      objective of the present study is the determination of the natural history of
      coronary calcification progression in patients converted to NHD, and the
      examination of the relationships between calcification risk factors and
      calcification progression in these patients. METHODS: Thirty-eight ESRD patients 
      were converted to NHD, and included in our observational cohort study. Coronary
      artery calcification scores (CACS) were documented at baseline and
      post-conversion (mean interscan duration 16+/-1 months). Other variables of
      interest included age, dialysis vintage, Framingham risk profile, phosphate
      binder and vitamin D usage, and plasma levels of calcium, phosphate and
      parathyroid hormone. RESULTS: Our cohort was stratified according to baseline
      calcification burden (minimal calcification: CACS < or = 10 vs significant
      calcification: CACS > 10). Twenty-four patients had baseline CACS < or = 10.
      These patients demonstrated no change in coronary calcification after 1 year of
      NHD (from 0.7+/-0.5 to 6+/-3, P = 0.1). Fourteen patients had higher initial CACS
      at baseline (1874+/-696), and demonstrated a non-significant 9% increase over 1
      year to 2038+/-740 (P = 0.1). Plasma phosphate and calcium x phosphate product
      were significantly reduced, as were calcium-based phosphate binder and
      antihypertensive usage. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to document CACS
      progression in a cohort of NHD patients. Further analysis of the effect of NHD on
      the physiology of cardiovascular calcification is required.

      arterial disorders.
PG  - 105-10
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cardiovascular disease is a major factor in the high mortality
      of patients with end-stage renal disease, and this population is particularly
      appropriate to analyse the impact of cardiovascular risk markers on outcome.
      RECENT FINDINGS: Cardiovascular risk markers in end-stage renal disease include
      age, left ventricular mass, carotid intima-media thickness, blood pressure and
      aortic stiffness (pulse wave velocity). Aortic pulse wave velocity has been shown
      to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality in patients with
      end-stage renal disease and the general population. Aortic pulse wave velocity
      has the highest sensitivity and specificity as a predictor of cardiovascular
      death in end-stage renal disease patients. Pulse wave velocity is an integrated
      index of vascular function and structure, and is a major determinant of systolic 
      hypertension, thereby increasing left ventricular afterload, left ventricular
      hypertrophy and left ventricular oxygen consumption. Decreased diastolic blood
      pressure, another consequence of arterial stiffening, is associated with
      decreased coronary perfusion contributing to ischaemic heart disease and
      evolution of adaptive into maladaptive left ventricular hypertrophy. SUMMARY:
      Aortic stiffness measurements could serve as an important tool in identifying
      end-stage renal disease patients at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. The
      ability to identify these patients would lead to better risk stratification and
      earlier and more cost-effective preventive therapy.

TI  - Vascular calcifications in uremia: old concepts and new insights.
PG  - 60-8
AB  - The annual mortality rate in uremic patients, corrected for age, sex, and race,
      is significantly higher than in the general population. This is primarily due to 
      cardiovascular events. Vascular calcifications play a vital role in the
      development of cardiovascular morbidity and subsequent increased mortality.
      Vascular calcification affects both vascular intima and media layers and its
      mechanism remains poorly understood. Over the last few years it has been shown
      that, in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, disturbances in
      mineral metabolism in the uremic milieu, calcium-containing phosphate binders,
      and vitamin D treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism may contribute to the
      pathogenesis of vascular calcifications. Other uremia-related risk factors
      (e.g.increased oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uremic toxins,
      increased oxidative stress, dialysis and dialysate-related factors, hemodynamic
      overload, hyperhomocysteinemia) may also play a role. In uremic patients, apart
      from these facilitating factors, decreased levels of endogenous calcification
      inhibitors such as fetuin-Amatrix Gla protein, osteoprotegerin, and osteopontin
      have also been associated with increased calcium-phosphate precipitation in
      extraskeletal tissues. Finally, vascular calcification is the outcome of the
      active and dynamic balance of procalcifying and anticalcifying influences. For
      the prevention and treatment of vascular calcifications, it is essential to avoid
      treatment modalities that lead to calcium overload, achieve good metabolic
      control, and optimize dialysis.

TI  - Study on the relationship of serum fetuin-A concentration with aortic stiffness
      in patients on dialysis.
PG  - 1293-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in aortic stiffness, as reflected by an increase in pulse
      wave velocity (PWV) or aortic augmentation index (AI) is an important predictor
      of cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. Dysregulation of calcification 
      inhibitors, such as fetuin-A, is involved in vascular pathology in dialysis
      patients and fetuin-A is inversely related to mortality in dialysis patients. In 
      this study, the relation between serum fetuin-A concentration and parameters of
      aortic stiffness was investigated in patients with end-stage renal disease.
      METHODS: In a cross-sectional study we included 131 dialysis patients, aged
      62+/-14 years (33 on peritoneal dialysis and 98 on haemodialysis), and 41
      controls, aged 60+/-8 years. Time-averaged pre-dialysis values of serum albumin, 
      Ca, P and intact parathyroid hormone were included in multiregression analysis,
      as were high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), fetuin-A, age, mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) and dialysis modality. PWV and AI were measured with the
      SphygmoCor device. RESULTS: Mean fetuin-A concentration in dialysis patients
      (0.63+/-0.16 g/l) did not differ from controls (0.63+/-0.11 g/l). Median hsCRP
      levels in dialysis patients were higher compared with controls (4.0 vs 1.9 mg/l; 
      P<0.0001). PWV but not AI was higher in dialysis patients than in controls (9.9
      vs 7.9 m/s; P<0.0001). In univariate analysis in dialysis patients, fetuin-A
      levels were inversely related to both PWV (r = - 0.25, P = 0.007) and AI (r = -
      0.26, P = 0.006), respectively. However, after correction for age, gender, MAP
      and diabetes mellitus, this relation lost statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In a dialysis population with a relatively low level of inflammatory activity,
      the soluble calcification inhibitor fetuin-A could not be identified as an
      independent predictor of aortic stiffness as measured with PWV and AI.

TI  - Vascular calcification in dialysis patients.
PG  - 4183-6
AB  - UNLABELLED: The risk factors for vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients
      include duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, aging, hyperphosphatemia,
      hyperparathyroidism, and calcium or vitamin D supplementation. This study was
      performed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for VC in our dialysis
      population. METHODS: One hundred twenty-nine chronic dialysis patients underwent 
      plain x-rays of the hands for VC. Patients were grouped as either positive (PVC) 
      or negative (NVC) for VC. Age, gender, duration of dialysis, presence of
      non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), oral calcium, and
      1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 supplement, serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus
      (P), calcium phosphorus product (CaxP), alkaline phosphates (ALP) and intact
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS:
      Thirty-four patients (26.35%) showed VC. There were no differences between PVC
      and NVC patients for duration of dialysis (38.4 +/- 27.7 for PVC and 34.6 +/-
      31.2 months for NVC, P = .80), levels of serum Ca (P = .26), P (P = .19), CaxP (P
      = .33), ALP (P = .89), or iPTH (P = .24). Similarly, oral calcium and
      1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 intake were not different between the two groups (P =
      .971 and P = .3710 respectively). Compared to NVC patients, PVC patients were
      older (56.3 +/- 10.4 versus 47.5 +/- 16.1 years, P = .008) and had a greater
      incidence of NIDDM (17/34 PVC and diabetic versus 20/95 NVC, P = .001). In
      conclusion, for patients with a medium length of dialysis, the duration of
      dialysis as well as the doses of calcium salts and of 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3
      were not significantly associated with vascular calcifications, but it was not
      possible to exclude a role for these and other factors in patients with longer
      dialysis.

TI  - Cross-sectional association of kidney function with valvular and annular
      calcification: the Framingham heart study.
PG  - 521-7
AB  - Valvular calcification is common in the setting of end-stage kidney disease and
      is associated with increased risks for cardiovascular disease events. It is
      unknown whether the prevalence of valvular calcification is increased in milder
      kidney disease after accounting for cardiovascular risk factors. Participants who
      attended the sixth examination of the Framingham Offspring Study (1995 to 1998)
      were eligible. Kidney function was estimated by GFR using the simplified
      Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. Mitral annular
      calcification (MAC), aortic sclerosis, and aortic annular calcification were
      assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography. Logistic regression was used to
      examine the odds of valvular calcification among participants with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD; GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)). A total of 3047 participants (52%
      women; mean age 59 +/- 10 yr) were available for analysis. CKD was present in
      8.6% (n = 262) of the sample. Among participants with valve/annular calcification
      (n = 284; 9.3%), 20% had CKD, compared with 7% in patients without valvular
      calcification. After adjustment for age, gender, systolic and diastolic BP,
      hypertension treatment, total/HDL cholesterol, body mass index, diabetes, smoking
      status, and cardiovascular disease, participants with CKD had a 60% increased
      odds of MAC (odds ratio 1.6; 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.5). There was no
      significant association between CKD and either aortic sclerosis or aortic annular
      calcification (odds ratio 1.1 and 1.1, respectively). After age and gender
      adjustment, the combination of both CKD and MAC was associated with a three-fold 
      increased risk for death compared with those with neither condition (P = 0.0004).
      In the community, CKD is associated with presence of MAC before the onset of
      ESRD. Further research is warranted to understand whether traditional and novel
      vascular risk factor burden, as well as metabolic derangements found in early
      kidney disease, can account for the CKD-MAC association.

TI  - Long-term outcomes in patients with calciphylaxis from hyperparathyroidism.
PG  - 96-102
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calciphylaxis is a rare condition associated with chronic renal
      failure and entails a very poor prognosis. Pathogenesis is poorly understood but 
      involves abnormalities in calcium and phosphorus metabolism that lead to vascular
      and extravascular calcification. Patients present with painful ulcerating plaques
      that progress to gangrenous wounds. Parathyroidectomy has been advanced as a
      life-saving intervention in these patients, but long-term results with wound
      healing and survival after parathyroidectomy are not well described. METHODS:
      Between January 1987 and October 2003, 15 patients with biopsy-confirmed
      calciphylaxis were treated at the University of Wisconsin. Of these 15 patients, 
      9 were treated with medical therapy (bisphosphonates and phosphate binders),
      whereas 6 underwent parathyroidectomy. The medical records were reviewed, and
      patients or relatives were interviewed. Survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier
      analysis. RESULTS: Four patients underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy, and two
      patients underwent total parathyroidectomy. All had reductions in the intact
      parathyroid hormone level (mean +/- SD, 25.2 +/- 4.5 pg/mL). Whereas all six
      patients treated with parathyroidectomy had partial/complete wound healing, only 
      two of nine in the medical group had any improvements in the skin lesions (P =
      .006). With up to 80 months of follow-up, patients who underwent
      parathyroidectomy had a longer median survival compared with those who did not
      have surgery (39 vs. 3 months; P = .017). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our
      long-term follow-up of this patient population, subtotal or total
      parathyroidectomy was associated with long-term survival and was more likely to
      promote healing if performed earlier in the course of disease. Therefore,
      patients with calciphylaxis from secondary hyperparathyroidism should be referred
      promptly for potential parathyroidectomy.

TI  - Serum albumin, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and fetuin a as predictors of
      malnutrition, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in patients with ESRD.
PG  - 139-48
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum albumin (S-Alb), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6
      (IL-6) predict malnutrition, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), and
      mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Fetuin A, an inhibitor
      of vascular calcification, also is associated strongly with clinical outcome in
      patients with ESRD. In this study, multivariate analyses were performed to assess
      these 4 biomarkers as predictors of malnutrition, CVD, and mortality in patients 
      with ESRD. METHODS: One hundred seventy-six patients with ESRD (54 +/- 12 years) 
      underwent measurements of S-Alb, high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), plasma IL-6, and 
      fetuin A close to the start of dialysis therapy and were followed up for a median
      of 26 months (range, 1 to 66 months). Nutritional status was evaluated by means
      of subjective global assessment. CVD was defined based on medical history.
      Associations between biomarker levels and malnutrition, CVD, and mortality were
      evaluated by means of receiver operating characteristic curve, logistic
      regression analysis, and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: All 4
      biomarkers predicted malnutrition, CVD, and mortality. Multivariate analysis,
      according to receiver operating characteristic analysis, showed that malnutrition
      was predicted best by hs-CRP and IL-6 levels; CVD, by IL-6 level; and mortality, 
      by albumin and IL-6 levels. When using the cutoff levels derived from receiver
      operating characteristics, logistic regression analysis showed that only hs-CRP
      level (odds ratio [OR], 3.6) was associated with malnutrition, and only IL-6
      level (OR, 3.7) was associated with CVD. Levels of S-Alb, IL-6, and fetuin A, but
      not hs-CRP, were associated with increased relative risk for mortality as
      assessed by Cox in a model adjusting for age, sex, and diabetes mellitus.
      CONCLUSION: Multivariate analyses show that in patients with ESRD, malnutrition
      is predicted best by hs-CRP and IL-6 levels; CVD, by IL-6 level; and mortality,
      by S-Alb, IL-6, and fetuin A levels, but not by hs-CRP level. This comparative
      analysis indicates that of these biomarkers, IL-6 level may be the most reliable 
      predictor of CVD and mortality in patients with ESRD.

PG  - 994-9
AB  - We evaluated the risk of coronary-artery disease in patients with chronic renal
      failure (CRF) by measuring the coronary-artery calcium scores with electron beam 
      CT (EBCT). A total of 81 CRF patients were divided into three groups;
      pre-dialysis (group I, n = 35), hemodialysis (group II, n = 31) and peritoneal
      dialysis (group III, n = 15). The several serum biochemical markers and calcium
      score levels by EBCT were determined. The Ca x P products were significantly
      higher in groups II (p < 0.05) and III (p < 0.01) than in group I. The serum
      calcium levels were significantly higher in group III than in both group I (p <
      0.01) and II (p < 0.05). The serum calcium level in 15 patients with a calcium
      score > 400 was significantly higher than the 66 patients with a score < or =400 
      (p < 0.01). The calcium score was significantly higher in the 15 patients with
      cardiovascular complications than in the 66 patients without cardiovascular
      complications (628.9+/-904.8 vs. 150.4+/-350.9, p < 0.01). EBCT seemed to be a
      good diagnostic tool for evaluating the risk of coronary-artery disease
      ''noninvasively'' in CRF patients who are at increased risk of cardiovascular
      morbidity and mortality.

PG  - 848-52
AB  - This study examined intima-media thickness and arterial plaque occurrence in the 
      carotid and brachial arteries in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)
      patients. The study compared 25 CAPD patients with 25 normotensive age- and
      sex-matched controls. Intima-media thickness and presence of plaque in carotid
      and brachial artery were measured three times using high-resolution B-mode
      echocardiography. Left ventricular mass was calculated using the Penn Convection 
      equation. Blood samples were obtained to assess levels of phosphorus, total
      calcium, serum albumin, C-reactive protein, and lipid profiles. Compared to the
      control group, CAPD patients had greater mean carotid and brachial intima-media
      thickness, and a higher proportion of subjects with calcified plaques. The left
      ventricular mass index was higher in CAPD patients with carotid artery calcified 
      plaques compared to CAPD patients without carotid artery calcified plaques. CAPD 
      patients with such plaque were significantly associated with diabetes mellitus,
      higher C-reactive protein levels and a lower 2-yr survival rate. The present
      study showed an high prevalence of carotid calcification in CAPD patients and
      those with such calcification had a greater incidence of diabetes mellitus,
      higher C-reactive protein levels and left ventricular mass index, and a lower
      survival rate.

TI  - Matrix GLA protein gene polymorphisms: clinical correlates and cardiovascular
      mortality in chronic kidney disease patients.
PG  - 548-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased vascular calcification plays an important role in the
      pathogenesis of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
      It is the result of an active ossification process counteracted by 'protective'
      proteins, such as matrix GLA protein (MGP). Polymorphisms of MGP have been
      identified. METHODS: The aim of this study was to define the distribution of two 
      MGP polymorphisms (-7, -138) in 99 hemodialysis (HD) patients, in 26 patients
      with CKD stage 3 and in 135 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients were 
      followed up for 12 months to record any cardiovascular deaths. The cause of death
      was determined by medical doctors, considering the medical history of each
      patient. The primers were designed with Primer Express software. RESULTS: MGP
      -138TT homozygotes were more frequent in the HD group versus controls (p =
      0.0004). Additionally, the frequency of the T allele was significantly higher in 
      the HD group (p = 0.0006). The frequency of the A allele of MGP-7 was
      significantly higher both in the HD group (p = 0.033) and in the CKD group (p =
      0.0017) versus controls. MGP-7 GG homozygotes were significantly less common in
      the CKD group than in controls (p = 0.037). Combination -138TT -7AA was
      significantly more frequent in both CKD patients (p = 0.001) and in HD patients
      (p = 0.029) than in controls. Seventeen out of 99 HD patients experienced fatal
      cardiovascular events. Sixteen (94.1%) were -138TT homozygotes and either -7AA
      homozygotes or -7GA heterozygotes. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that CKD and
      HD patients have a different distribution of MGP gene polymorphism as compared
      with the normal population. Altered MGP gene polymorphism may be a negative
      prognostic factor for the progression to end-stage renal disease and for
      cardiovascular events in CKD patients.

      programmed hemodialysis].
PG  - 50-4
AB  - AIM: To estimate incidence and clinical significance of carotid and femoral
      arteries calcification in patients with terminal renal failure (TRF) on
      programmed hemodialysis (PH). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty four patients (25
      males and 9 females) with TRF were divided into two groups by severity of
      hyperphosphatemia: 15 patients with P < 6 mg/dl (group 1) and 19 patients with P 
      > 6 mg/dl. The groups were matched by age (44.4 +/- 15.05 and 42.7 +/- 14.23
      years, respectively) and PH duration (2.4 +/- 1.1 and 2.6 +/- 1.16 years,
      respectively). Calcification of the arteries and structure of the vascular wall
      were examined with ultrasonic dopplerography of the common carotid and femoral
      arteries. Measurements were made of intima-media complex (IMC) thickness,
      systolic and diastolic diameter of the right and left carotid artery. The
      arteries were studied for the presence of calcinates and atherosclerotic plaques.
      RESULTS: Patients of group 2 showed a correlation between a P level, incidence
      rate of common carotid arteries calcification, atherosclerotic plaques in the
      femoral arteries, IMC of the carotid and femoral arteries, left ventricular
      hypertrophy and a decline in a left ventricular diastolic function. A significant
      correlation was established between the rate of atherosclerotic plaques detection
      and age, male sex, smoking and history of PH. An increase in IMC and arterial
      rigidity was revealed in 12 (63.2%) of 19 patients of group 2. They had episodes 
      of intradialysis hypotonia, 6 (31.6%) patients had acute coronary syndrome, 5
      (26.3%) patients--cardiac arrhythmia. CONCLUSION: A significant contribution to
      formation of risk factors of cardiovascular complications in TRF patients on PH
      is made by disturbed phosphorus-calcium metabolism resulting in higher rigidity
      and diameter of the arteries. The above changes lead to a rise in systolic
      pressure and fall in diastolic one. Increased pulse pressure is an independent
      predictor of the risk to develop acute coronary syndrome.

      patients. This study examined the risk factors of aortic calcification in a large
      number of haemodialysis patients, and compared risk factors between diabetic and 
      non-diabetic patients. METHODS: The subjects were 667 patients on maintenance
      haemodialysis: 184 with type 2 diabetes and 483 without. Aortic calcification was
      measured semi-quantitatively using a plain computed tomography image of the
      abdominal aorta, and an aortic calcification index (ACI) was calculated. RESULTS:
      The ACI of the diabetic subjects was significantly higher than that of those
      without diabetes (57.3+/-22.1 vs 44.8+/-28.3%, P < 0.0001), although the dialysis
      vintage of the former was significantly shorter (P < 0.001). Multiple regression 
      analyses showed that diabetes was a significant independent risk factor for
      increased ACI. Multiple regression analyses, performed separately in diabetics
      and non-diabetics, revealed that advanced age, higher systolic blood pressure,
      smoking and longer haemodialysis vintage were common independent risk factors
      significantly associated with increased ACI in both patient groups (R2 = 0.296, P
      < 0.0001 for non-diabetics; R2 = 0.193, P < 0.0001 for diabetics). Higher serum
      phosphate concentration was not significantly associated with increased ACI in
      diabetic patients (P = 0.429), although it was a significant independent factor
      in non-diabetic patients (beta = 0.150, P < 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Aortic
      calcification in diabetic haemodialysis patients is more advanced, compared with 
      non-diabetic patients, even with short haemodialysis vintage. Since disorders of 
      mineral metabolism are not significantly associated with aortic calcification in 
      diabetic haemodialysis patients, aortic calcification in these patients could be 
      affected by metabolic abnormalities associated with the diabetic state per se,
      independent of other confounding factors; and aortic calcification may be
      advanced even before haemodialysis induction.

TI  - Evaluation of aortic arch calcification in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 289-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the general population, aortic arch calcification (AAC) is related
      to cardiovascular (CV) disease. Vascular calcifications are common findings in
      dialysis patients; therefore, we carried out a retrospective study evaluating
      which risk factors are associated to AAC in stable hemodialysis (HD) patients.
      METHODS: Standard posterior-anterior chest radiographs, performed the day after
      the midweek HD session in 132 patients (mean age 65 +/- 12 yrs) who had been on
      renal replacement therapy (RRT) for 33 months (range 1-471), were analyzed.
      Cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) was also calculated. RESULTS: AAC was detected in 51% 
      of patients. They were older (68 +/- 8 vs. 62 +/- 14 yrs; p = 0.003), were on RRT
      for longer (51 (range 2-471) vs. 22 (range 1-195) months; p = 0.0001), had
      greater CTR (54 (32-71) vs. 50% (40-65); p = 0.034) and higher prevalence of
      peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (40 vs. 17%; p = 0.049), whilst body weight was
      lower (62 +/- 14 vs. 68 +/- 14 kg; p = 0.04) than those without AAC. On the
      contrary, sex, diabetes frequency, smoking habit, history of hypertension and
      hyperphosphatemia, cerebrovascular and ischemic heart disease (IHD), blood
      pressure (BP) and antihypertensive therapy, lipids, albumin, degree of anemia,
      calcium, phosphate and their product were no different between the two groups.
      Logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio (OR) 1.069 95%
      confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-1.11; p = 0.003), length of time on RRT (OR
      1.02 95% CI 1.01-1.03; p = 0.0002), calcium-phosphate product (OR 1.03 95% CI
      1.007-1.07; p = 0.016), systolic BP (OR 1.03 95% CI 1.005-1.06; p = 0.02) and PVD
      (OR 3.08 95% CI 1.17-8.06; p = 0.02) were independently associated to AAC.
      CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that AAC is related to atherosclerosis and to renal
      failure-related CV risk factors. A careful evaluation of a frequently performed
      investigation is useful in CV disease risk stratification in HD patients.

TI  - Coronary artery calcification in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 1942-7
AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in renal transplant
      recipients. Although renal transplant recipients frequently undergo cardiac
      functional tests prior to surgery, coronary atherosclerosis can remain
      undetected. Coronary artery calcification (CAC), an early marker of
      atherosclerosis can be quantified using EBCT. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the extent and characteristics of CAC at the time of renal
      transplantation. We evaluated 79 consecutive incident asymptomatic renal
      transplant recipients. Patients were mostly White (62%), male (54%) and had a
      deceased donor renal transplant (61%). The mean age was 47 (12.1) years.
      Sixty-five percentage of subjects had CAC. The mean CAC score was 331.5 (562.4)
      with a median of 43.3. Older age, presence of diabetes, not having a preemptive
      transplant, deceased donor transplantation and hypercholesterolemia were
      significantly associated with presence of CAC univariately. Median CAC scores
      were significantly increased in subjects with diabetes (127.8 vs. 28.9, p=0.05), 
      exposed to dialysis (102.9 vs. 3.7, p<0.001) and deceased donor recipients (169.7
      vs. 7.5, p=0.02). Using multiple logistic regression, age and time on dialysis
      were significantly associated with the presence of CAC at the time of transplant.
      In summary, CAC is prevalent in patients undergoing kidney transplant. CAC may be
      a method to identify renal transplant recipients at increased risk for future
      cardiovascular events.

TI  - Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia in chronically dialyzed patients: a disease
      with multiple risk factors.
PG  - c87-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) can be a fatal complication 
      in dialysis patients. Intradialytic hypotension is usually the precipitating
      factor. The occurrence of 16 cases in 5 years (1998-2002), compared with only 4
      in previous years, led us to investigate other risk factors contributing to NOMI.
      A control group of stable hemodialysis patients was used for comparison. RESULTS:
      20 patients were studied: 17 diagnosed surgically, and 3 clinically. The mean age
      was 70.8 +/- 1.8 years, and the male:female ratio 7:13. Nineteen patients were on
      hemodialysis. Clinically overt atherosclerosis was present in 17 patients.
      Preceding dialysis-associated hypotension was identified in all patients studied 
      and access thrombosis in 6 patients. In all patients, abdominal pain was the
      presenting symptom. Initial abdominal examination was unimpressive in 16
      patients. The hemoconcentration, leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis were the
      most prominent laboratory findings. 5/11 abdominal sonograms showed intestinal
      pathology. 2/3 angiographies were diagnostic. Three patients responded to early
      fluid challenge and did not require surgery. Pathology was related to the area of
      the superior mesenteric artery in all 15 patients operated. Twelve (60%) patients
      died from the event. The 1-year mortality rate was 17/20 patients (85%). Possible
      contributing factors, other than dialysis-associated hypotension, included:
      high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) therapy (179 +/- 35 vs. 116
      +/- 10 U/kg/week in the control group, p < 0.05); metastatic calcifications
      (abdominal aorta 14/14, aortic valve 11/18; medial calcification of mesenteric
      arteries in 2/11 pathology specimens); digoxin, and hypoalbuminemia. CONCLUSIONS:
      The increased incidence of NOMI in dialysis patients may be related to overly
      aggressive rhEPO therapy and the unsuspected presence of mesenteric arterial
      medial calcifications. Identification of patients at risk, prevention of
      intradialytic hypotension and a controlled increase in dry weight may help to
      reduce the incidence of NOMI in chronically dialyzed patients.

TI  - Cardiovascular calcification in Hispanic Americans (HA) with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) due to type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 271-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular calcification (CVC) is common and severe in patients
      with end-stage renal disease on dialysis. However, the prevalence and severity of
      CVC is less well documented in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet
      on dialysis. METHODS: Fifty-eight nondialyzed HA with type 2 diabetes and CKD
      were enrolled. They comprise 29 patients with stages 1 and 2 CKD (early CKD
      group) and 26 patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD (advanced CKD group). Coronary
      artery calcification (CAC) was measured by ultrafast spiral computed tomography, 
      while peripheral artery calcification (PAC) was evaluated by plain x-ray of the
      chest, pelvis, thighs, and lower extremities. RESULTS: The prevalence of CAC and 
      PAC were significantly higher in the advanced CKD group compared to the early CKD
      group (73% vs. 38%; P < 0.01 and 85% vs. 35%; P < 0.0001, respectively). The
      median CAC scores were 18-fold greater in the advanced CKD group (138.9 vs. 7.8, 
      respectively). By linear regression analysis, a strong association was found
      between the level of renal function and ln total volume of CAC. CONCLUSION: Our
      data indicate that CAC and PAC are common and severe in HA diabetic patients with
      CKD not previously treated with dialysis, calcium-based phosphate binders, or
      vitamin D analogues. Lower level of renal function is associated with increased
      burden of vascular calcification in predialysis patients with CKD.

TI  - Low fetuin-A levels are associated with cardiovascular death: Impact of
      variations in the gene encoding fetuin.
PG  - 2383-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
      patients and a central characteristic of the atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease observed in dialysis patients. Fetuin-A, a circulating calcium-regulatory
      glycoprotein that inhibits vascular calcification, is associated with
      inflammation and outcome in dialysis patients. In the present study, we evaluated
      the association between fetuin-A, clinical phenotype, and outcome, as well as the
      impact of fetuin gene (AHSG) polymorphisms on the protein product and outcome.
      METHODS: In a cohort of 258 (161 males) ESRD patients starting renal replacement 
      therapy [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 6.8 +/- 0.2 mL/min] aged 52 +/- 1 years
      the following parameters were studied: presence of malnutrition (subjective
      global assessment), comorbidity [diabetes mellitus and clinical manifest
      cardiovascular disease (CVD)], carotid plaques (N= 101), hs-CRP, fetuin-A,
      S-albumin, interleukin (IL)-6, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 
      AHSG gene (N= 215) at amino acid positions Thr248Met (C-->T), Thr256Ser (C-->G), 
      Asp276Asn (G-->A), and Arg317Cys (C-->T). RESULTS: Both all-cause (P < 0.001) and
      cardiovascular (P < 0.001) mortality were associated with low fetuin-A levels
      independently of age, smoking, diabetes, S-albumin, CVD, and inflammation (CRP > 
      or =10 mg/L). Inflamed (0.199 vs. 0.247 g/L; P < 0.01) and malnourished (0.207
      vs. 0.262 g/L; P < 0.05) patients had significantly lower median fetuin-A than
      noninflamed and well-nourished ESRD patients, respectively. In a logistic
      regression model (N= 101), fetuin-A was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with 
      the presence of carotid plaques independently of age, CVD, diabetes, S-albumin,
      gender, and inflammation. Significant correlations were observed between fetuin-A
      and both S-albumin (Rho = 0.30; P < 0.0001) and IL-6 (Rho =-0.21; P < 0.01).
      Patients with the AHSG 256Ser allele had lower serum fetuin-A levels, and higher 
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rate if they were inflamed. CONCLUSION:
      The present study shows that a low fetuin-A level is associated with
      malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (carotid plaques), as well as
      with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Because the present study 
      demonstrates an effect of variations in the AHSG gene on both circulating
      fetuin-A levels and outcome, this indicates that ESRD patients with the AHSG
      256Ser allele are at risk of accelerated vascular calcification.

TI  - Length of interdialytic interval influences serum calcium and phosphorus
      concentrations.
PG  - 1643-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Higher levels of serum phosphorus and calcium are associated with
      increased haemodialysis (HD) patient mortality. Both of these factors act
      synergistically to promote vascular smooth muscle differentiation to an
      osteoblast-like phenotype and subsequent vascular calcification. The aim of this 
      study was to investigate the influence of interdialytic interval on serum levels,
      as well as the influence of oral calcium-based phosphate binder load on the
      magnitude of the observed differences. METHODS: We studied 100 patients
      undergoing HD three times per week, over a 2 week period. Haemoglobin, albumin,
      calcium and phosphate were measured pre-dialysis before each HD session. Oral
      phosphate binder usage was recorded. All patients were treated with dialysate
      containing 1.25 mEq/l calcium. RESULTS: Both mean serum phosphate and calcium
      were higher after the long interdialytic interval (1.59+/-0.05 vs 1.45+/-0.04
      mmol/l, P = 0.0005, and 2.46+/-0.03 vs 2.4+/-0.02 mmol/l, P = 0.001, for serum
      phosphate and uncorrected calcium, respectively). There were no significant
      differences in haemoglobin or serum albumin, indicating that variable dilution
      from an increased hydration status in the long interdialytic interval was
      unlikely to contribute to these observed differences. A total of 74 patients were
      treated with calcium-containing binders and 26 patients with sevelamer. Patients 
      on sevelamer did not exhibit the observed cyclical increase in serum calcium seen
      in patients on calcium-containing binders (mean difference in serum calcium
      0.09+/-0.01 mmol/l in the calcium-treated group vs 0.01+/-0.01 mmol/l in the
      sevelamer-treated patients, P = 0.0004). The increase in serum calcium after the 
      long interval as compared with the short interval was proportional to the daily
      amount of the oral calcium-containing binder load ingested (r = 0.63, P<0.0001). 
      CONCLUSION: Cyclical differences in interdialytic interval and overall exposure
      to both dietary phosphate and oral calcium load influence serum levels. This may 
      have consequences for registry reporting, therapy modulation and potentially the 
      pathogenesis of accelerated vascular calcification seen in HD patients.

TI  - Modeling the implications of changes in vascular calcification in patients on
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 1532-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Treat-to-Goal Study found that sevelamer slowed the progression
      of coronary calcification in patients on hemodialysis compared to calcium-based
      phosphate binders. To understand the implications of this effect for
      cardiovascular events, risk equations are needed. METHODS: Data on 179 patients
      on hemodialysis treated at one center in France included biochemical values
      during the year prior to study entry, patient characteristics, and cardiovascular
      events over an average of 4 years. As arterial calcification was evaluated
      ultrasonographically and quantified using a 0 to 4 score, an equation relating
      this to the electron-beam tomography (EBT)-based calcification score used in the 
      trial was developed and applied to all patients. The estimated scores were then
      used in survival and Cox proportional hazards analyses of cardiovascular events
      in relation to the degree of calcification, controlling for other
      characteristics. RESULTS: Mean age at inclusion was 54 years, dialysis vintage 70
      months, average follow-up 49 months; 32% suffered an event. The calcification
      score, diabetes, C-reactive protein (CRP), diastolic blood pressure, gender,
      smoking and hypertension are independent predictors of cardiovascular risk. The
      resulting equation indicates that, relative to a calcification score below 400,
      the risk of an initial event increases 44% for a score of 600, and more than
      doubles for a score of 1000. CONCLUSION: In the absence of long-term follow-up
      studies, these equations permit quantification of the expected long-term clinical
      consequences of the impact of various phosphate binders on vascular
      calcification. Together with resource use and cost information, these equations
      are key inputs for formal cost-effectiveness analyses.

TI  - Traditional and non-traditional risk factors as contributors to atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 405-16
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although traditional risk factors, 
      such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and advanced age, are
      prevalent in ESRD patients they may not be sufficient by themselves to account
      for the high prevalence of CVD in patients with this condition. Thus, the search 
      for other, non-traditional, risk factors that may be involved in the pathogenesis
      of uremic CVD has been an area of intense study. Data suggest that the
      accelerated atherosclerotic process of ESRD may involve several interrelated
      processes, such as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and vascular
      calcification, in a milieu of constant low-grade inflammation. The cause(s) of
      inflammation in ESRD are multifactorial and, while it may reflect underlying CVD,
      an acute-phase reaction may also be a direct cause of vascular injury via several
      pathogenetic mechanisms. Available data suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines
      play a central role in the genesis of both malnutrition and CVD in ESRD. Thus, it
      could be speculated that suppression of the vicious cycle of malnutrition,
      inflammation and atherosclerosis (MIA syndrome) would improve survival in
      dialysis patients. Recent evidence has demonstrated strong associations between
      inflammation and both increased oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in
      ESRD patients. As there is not yet any recognized, or even proposed, treatment
      for ESRD patients with chronic inflammation it would be of obvious interest to
      study the long-term effect of various anti-inflammatory treatment strategies on
      the nutritional and cardiovascular status as well as outcome of these patients.

TI  - Association of conjunctival and corneal calcification with vascular calcification
      in dialysis patients.
PG  - 550-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjunctival and corneal calcification (CCC) is a well-known and
      easily detectable extraskeletal calcification, but its association with vascular 
      calcification was not investigated previously. The aim of this study is to
      investigate the relationship of CCC with vascular calcification and bone
      metabolism parameters in dialysis patients. METHODS: We evaluated 63 patients (30
      men, 33 women; mean age, 43.5 +/- 13.4 years) who were on dialysis therapy for
      more than 6 months. Forty-four patients were on peritoneal dialysis and 19
      patients were on hemodialysis therapy. The same observer evaluated the presence
      of CCC by using a slit-lamp microscope, and a total CCC score was recorded for
      each patient. Fifty-two age- and sex-matched healthy controls also were evaluated
      by using the same method. Biochemical data were collected from patient files.
      Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured, and
      the presence of vascular calcification was assessed by using x-ray examinations
      of the pelvis and hands. RESULTS: Mean CCC score in patients was significantly
      higher than that in controls (6.2 +/- 5.1 versus 1.3 +/- 1.8; P = 0.001). CCC
      score correlated significantly with duration of renal replacement therapy ( r s =
      0.392; P = 0.002), serum phosphorus level ( r s = 0.259; P = 0.042), and calcium 
      x phosphorus product ( r s = 0.337; P = 0.007). However, we did not find a
      significant correlation with calcium, parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, 
      albumin, or C-reactive protein level or BMD. The frequency of vascular
      calcification was significantly greater in patients with a high CCC score (CCC
      score > or = 10) compared with a low CCC score (< or =3; 56.3% versus 5.6%; P =
      0.002). CONCLUSION: Evaluation of CCC score is an easy, fast, and noninvasive
      method. It seems that CCC score can be used as an additional tool to assess the
      status of extraskeletal calcification in dialysis patients.

TI  - Peripheral vascular disease and serum phosphorus in hemodialysis: a nested
      case-control study.
PG  - 98-105
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum phosphorus (P) and the product of serum calcium x serum P (Ca x
      P), are frequently elevated in end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance
      hemodialysis (HD). Elevated P and Ca x P have been associated with vascular
      calcification in dialysis patients. OBJECTIVE: [corrected] To examine the role of
      P and Ca x P as risk factors for incident peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in HD
      patients with pre-existing CVD. METHODS: This nested case-control study is drawn 
      from the 11 incident PVD events reported in the cohort of the Secondary
      prevention with antioxidants of cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease
      (SPACE): a randomized placebo-controlled trial. PVD was defined clinically and
      confirmed ultrasonographically. Each individual with a PVD event was matched for 
      SPACE treatment group (vitamin E or placebo), age (in 4-year categories) and
      gender with two individuals who had no CVD end point during the follow-up period.
      RESULTS: Serum P and Ca x P levels were significantly higher in PVD patients than
      in controls. In univariate logistic regression analysis, only serum P predicted
      PVD in this population (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.07 - 3.81, p = 0.03). In multivariate
      analysis, adjustment was made for variables dissimilar by PVD status including
      underlying renal disease, diabetes, smoking, history of angina pectoris,
      prescription for vitamin D3, erythropoietin, calcium channel blockers and
      aspirin. In this model, serum P remained the only significant predictor of
      incident PVD (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.01 - 5.74, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the
      present study are consistent with a role for serum P and Ca x P in the
      pathogenesis of PVD in HD patients.

TI  - Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are independent predictors of left
      ventricular hypertrophy in chronic haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 760-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accelerated atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are common in 
      chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate the
      relationship between left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in HD patients and
      atherosclerosis and vascular calcification measured by electron beam computed
      tomography (EBCT). METHODS: In a cohort of 118 HD patients (52 male, 66 female,
      mean age: 46+/-13 years), we measured biochemical parameters, including BUN,
      creatinine, albumin, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels, and
      performed echocardiography, high-resolution B-mode carotid ultrasonography and
      EBCT in 85 of them. The degree of stenosis was measured at four different sites
      (communis, bulbus, interna and externa) in both carotid arteries. Carotid plaque 
      scores were calculated by summing the degrees of stenosis measured at all
      locations. RESULTS: LVH was detected in 89 of the patients (75%). Plaque-positive
      patients had higher left ventricular mass index (LVMI) than plaque-negative
      patients (175+/-59 vs 143+/-46 g/m2, P = 0.003). LVMI was correlated with
      systolic blood pressure (r = 0.62, P<0.001), pulse pressure (r = 0.58, P<0.001), 
      haemoglobin levels (r = - 0.25, P = 0.008), carotid plaque score (r = 0.32, P =
      0.001) and coronary (CACS) and aortic wall calcification score (AWCS) (r = 0.34, 
      P = 0.002 and r = 0.43, P<0.001, respectively). Multiple linear regression
      analysis (model r = 0.76) showed the independent factors related to LVMI to be
      systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, CACS and presence of carotid plaques.
      CONCLUSION: Extra-coronary atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are
      associated with LVH in HD patients. Whether the treatment of atherosclerosis or
      vascular calcification may cause regression of or even prevent LVH in HD patients
      remains to be seen.

TI  - Cardiac valvular calcification as a marker of atherosclerosis and arterial
      calcification in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 327-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk
      for tissue calcifications as a result of deranged mineral metabolism. We tested
      the hypothesis that valvular calcification is a marker of atherosclerosis in
      patients with ESRD. METHODS: Echocardiography was performed in 92 patients
      undergoing peritoneal dialysis with no background atherosclerotic vascular
      complications to detect valvular calcification. We used B-mode ultrasonography to
      determine carotid artery intima-media thickness and the presence of plaque and
      calcification. RESULTS: Compared with patients without valvular calcification
      (n=66), those with valvular calcification (n=26) had higher C-reactive protein
      levels (P=.01) and greater mean +/- SE carotid intima-media thickness (1.12 +/-
      0.06 vs 0.88 +/- 0.04 mm; P=.003). Carotid artery calcification was present
      unilaterally and bilaterally in 4 patients (15%) and 17 patients (65%) with
      valvular calcification vs 11 (17%) and 14 (21%) without, respectively (P<.001).
      Carotid artery plaque was present unilaterally and bilaterally in 11 patients
      (12%) and 16 patients (65%) with valvular calcification vs 3 (17%) and 17 (24%)
      without, respectively (P=.001). Using multiple logistic regression analysis,
      every 1-mm increase in carotid intima-media thickness was independently
      associated with a 6.51-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.58-26.73; P=.009)
      increased risk of valvular calcification, and calcification and plaque in the
      carotid arteries were associated with a 7.18-fold (95% confidence interval,
      2.39-21.51; P<.001) and a 5.00-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.77-14.13; P=.002)
      increased risk of valvular calcification, respectively. CONCLUSION: The
      associations among valvular calcification, inflammation, carotid atherosclerosis,
      and arterial calcification suggest that valvular calcification is a marker of
      atherosclerosis and arterial calcification in patients with ESRD.

TI  - Hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification in end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 178-82
AB  - Vascular calcification is a common finding in atherosclerosis and a serious
      problem in uremic patients. Because of the correlation of hyperphosphatemia and
      vascular calcification, the ability of extracellular inorganic phosphate levels
      to regulate human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSMC) culture mineralization in
      vitro was examined. HSMC cultured in media containing normal physiologic levels
      of inorganic phosphate (1.4 mM) did not mineralize. In contrast, HSMC cultured in
      media containing phosphate levels comparable with those seen in hyperphosphatemic
      individuals (>1.4 mM) showed dose-dependent increases in mineral deposition.
      Mechanistic studies showed that elevated phosphate treatment of HSMC also
      enhanced the expression of the osteoblastic differentiation markers osteocalcin
      and osf2/Cbfa-1. The effects of elevated phosphate on HSMC were mediated by a
      sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPC) as indicated by the ability of the
      specific NPC inhibitor phosphonoformic acid to dose-dependently inhibit
      phosphate-induced calcium deposition as well as osteocalcin and Cbfa-1 gene
      expression. The NPC in HSMC was identified as Pit-1, a member of the novel type
      III NPCs. These data suggest that elevated phosphate may directly stimulate HSMC 
      to undergo phenotypic changes that predispose to calcification and offers a novel
      explanation of the phenomenon of vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic
      conditions. Furthermore, we examined the factors affecting peripheral vascular
      calcification in 332 nondiabetic hemodialysis patients. There were 45 nondiabetic
      patients with vascular calcification. In multivariate logistic regression, the
      significant factors affecting vascular calcification were advanced age, longer
      duration of hemodialysis, increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and
      lower predialysis diastolic pressure. Our findings suggest that an elevated
      phosphate level may directly stimulate HSMC to undergo phenotypic changes that
      predispose to calcification and offer a novel explanation of the phenomenon of
      vascular calcification under hyperphosphatemic conditions.

TI  - Serum phosphate levels and mortality risk among people with chronic kidney
      disease.
PG  - 520-8
AB  - Elevated serum phosphate levels have been linked with vascular calcification and 
      mortality among dialysis patients. The relationship between phosphate and
      mortality has not been explored among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
      A retrospective cohort study was conducted from eight Veterans Affairs' Medical
      Centers located in the Pacific Northwest. CKD was defined by two continuously
      abnormal outpatient serum creatinine measurements at least 6 mo apart between
      1999 and 2002. Patients who received chronic dialysis, those with a present or
      previous renal transplant, and those without a recent phosphate measurement were 
      excluded. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. Secondary end points
      were acute myocardial infarction and the combined end point of myocardial
      infarction plus death. A total of 95,619 veterans with at least one primary care 
      or internal medicine clinic contact from a Northwest VA facility and two or more 
      outpatient measurements of serum creatinine, at least 6 mo apart, between January
      1, 1999, and December 31, 2002, were identified. From this eligible population,
      7021 patients met our definition of CKD. After exclusions, 6730 CKD patients were
      available for analysis, and 3490 had a serum phosphate measurement during the
      previous 18 mo. After adjustment, serum phosphate levels >3.5 mg/dl were
      associated with a significantly increased risk for death. Mortality risk
      increased linearly with each subsequent 0.5-mg/dl increase in serum phosphate
      levels. Elevated serum phosphate levels were independently associated with
      increased mortality risk among this population of patients with CKD.

PG  - 207-13
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of mortality among patients with
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with arterial disease and left ventricular
      hypertrophy being the two principal factors of the high mortality rate in this
      population. In addition to traditional risk factors (age, gender, diabetes,
      hypertension, lifestyle, hyperlipidemia, smoking, hyperhomocystinemia),
      inflammation, oxidative stress and disorders of mineral metabolism may contribute
      to cardiovascular risk in patients with uremic syndrome. High serum phosphate may
      influence vascular calcifications directly and indirectly, by worsening secondary
      hyperparathyroidism. Several treatment options are available for the treatment of
      hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with ESRD. The
      treatment approach includes a diet low in phosphorus, with less than 1 g/kg/day
      of protein. Vitamin D supplementation is an important part of treatment.
      Phosphate binding agents are in most of the patients necessary in addition to
      diet. Aluminum hydroxide has been widely used for many years. It is very potent, 
      but also very toxic, with severe encephalopathy as the most dangerous side
      effect. Calcium salts are less potent, and were considered safe for use in
      patients on dialysis. However, improvement in the understanding of vascular
      calcifications has demonstrated that calcium overload significantly contributes
      to widespread atherosclerosis in patients with ESRD. Sevelamer-hydrochloride is a
      novel non-aluminum, non-calcium containing phosphate binder, which is capable of 
      reducing the levels of phosphorus as well as of low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol, and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

TI  - Determinants of coronary artery calcification in diabetics with and without
      nephropathy.
PG  - 2022-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the general population, including those with diabetes mellitus,
      coronary artery calcification (CAC) correlates with atherosclerotic plaque
      burden. On the other hand, accumulating evidence suggests that disordered mineral
      metabolism significantly contributes to the vascular calcification in individuals
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). METHODS: In order to determine the relative 
      contribution of accelerated atherosclerosis and disordered mineral metabolism to 
      CAC in chronic kidney disease, a pilot study of 90 patients with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus was done [age, 40-65 years; normoalbuminuria, N= 30; diabetic
      nephropathy (DN), N= 60]. RESULTS: CAC was more prevalent and severe among
      individuals with DN compared to diabetic controls (odds ratio for prevalence 8.1,
      95% CI 2.3-28.5; median scores, 66 vs. 4, P < 0.001). None of the 4 measures of
      disordered mineral metabolism evaluated in this study (serum calcium, phosphorus,
      parathyroid hormone, and 1,25 di-hydroxy vitamin D levels) correlated with the
      prevalence or severity of CAC, or accounted for the differences seen between DN
      and diabetic controls. On the other hand, the difference in the severity of
      hypertension (number of antihypertensive medications) appeared to account for the
      differences in CAC burden seen between DN and diabetic controls. CONCLUSION: This
      first such study of nondialyzed individuals with DN suggests that, unlike ESRD
      patients, the high CAC burden seen at earlier stages of diabetic chronic kidney
      disease is probably unrelated to disordered mineral metabolism. The relationship 
      between the severity of hypertension and CAC burden provides a probable target
      for intervention in the predialysis phase of DN.

TI  - Survival following parathyroidectomy among United States dialysis patients.
PG  - 2010-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPTH) is highly prevalent among
      persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). SHPTH has been linked to uremic bone
      disease, vascular calcification, and a higher risk of death. Parathyroidectomy
      (PTX) can dramatically reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) and phosphate levels;
      however, the relationship between PTX and survival is not known. METHODS: We
      conducted an observational matched cohort study utilizing data from the United
      States Renal Database System (USRDS) in which 4558 patients undergoing a first
      PTX while on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis were individually matched by
      age, race, gender, cause of ESRD, dialysis duration, prior transplantation
      status, and dialysis modality to 4558 control patients who did not undergo PTX.
      Patients were followed from the date of PTX until they died or were lost to
      follow-up. RESULTS: The 30-day postoperative mortality rate following PTX was
      3.1%. Long-term relative risks of death among patients undergoing PTX were
      estimated to be 10% to 15% lower than those of matched control patients not
      undergoing surgery. Survival curves between the 2 groups crossed 587 days
      following PTX. Median survival was 53.4 months (95% CI: 51.2-56.4) in the PTX
      group, and 46.8 months (95% CI: 44.7-48.9) in the control group. CONCLUSION: PTX 
      was associated with higher short-term, and lower long-term, mortality rates among
      U.S. patients receiving chronic dialysis. Measures to attenuate SHPTH may play an
      important role in reducing mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease.

TI  - C-reactive protein is a significant predictor of vascular calcification of both
      aorta and hand arteries.
PG  - 408-12
AB  - Although evidence has accumulated indicating a close relationship between
      inflammation and atherosclerosis, the relationship between inflammation and
      vascular calcification in patients with chronic renal failure is unclear. In the 
      present study, the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP) and vascular
      calcification in dialysis patients was examined. Vascular calcification of the
      aorta and hand arteries of 512 hemodialysis patients without significant
      infection (age 58.8 +/- 10.1 y; 305 men, 207 women) were examined by
      roentgenography of the lateral abdomen and hands, respectively. Patients with a
      mean CRP level greater than 1.0 mg/L (n = 254) were older than those with a CRP
      level less than or equal to 1.0 mg/L (n = 258) and had a longer duration of
      dialysis, lower serum albumin level, and higher phosphate level ( P < .01, P <
      .05, P < .001, and P < .01, respectively). Prevalence of vascular calcification
      of aorta and hand arteries in the former group was significantly higher than in
      the latter (65.0% versus 43.8% for aorta, P < .0001; and 25.0% versus 14.7% for
      hand arteries, P < .01). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted 
      for age, hemodialysis duration, sex, levels of calcium and phosphate, and
      presence of diabetes, CRP level was a significant predictor for the presence of
      aortic calcification (odds ratio for highest versus lowest quartile, 2.669; 95%
      confidence interval, 1.539-5.421, P = .0010) and of calcification of hand
      arteries (odds ratio, 2.243; 95% confidence interval, 1.039-4.841; P = .0395). In
      conclusion, the present study shows that increased levels of CRP are
      significantly associated with the presence of vascular calcification in both
      aorta and hand arteries (ie, with both atheromatous and medial forms of
      calcification), indicating evidence for a relationship between inflammation and
      vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.

TI  - [Levels of serum ascorbate and its metabolites in hemodialysis patients].
PG  - 426-33
AB  - The status of ascorbic acid (AA) in dialysis patients is the subject of debate.
      Some reports have found AA to be deficient in dialysis patients, while others
      have found that AA is not deficient. In an attempt to confirm AA serum
      concentrations in dialysis patients, we analyzed the concentrations of AA as well
      as its metabolites using the specific determination of AA with chemical
      derivatization and the HPLC method. We studied 131 patients under maintenance
      hemodialysis therapy (HD), 23 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and 48
      healthy controls (C). Serum concentrations of AA and the AA metabolites
      dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) and 2, 3-diketogulonate (DKG) were measured by HPLC.
      Nine HD patients were taking AA supplements. Seventy-six (62.3%) of the 122 HD
      patients not taking AA supplements exhibited deficient levels of AA (< 20
      microM), while 13 (56.5%) of the 23 CRF patients and 9 (18.8%) of the 48 C showed
      deficient levels of AA. Analysis of AA metabolites in the normal-range AA (20-80 
      microM) group revealed that the DHA/AA ratio in HD patients was significantly
      higher than in C (3.3 +/- 2.6% and 1.2 +/- 2.2%, respectively). The DKG/AA ratio 
      in HD patients was higher than in CRF patients (3.6 +/- 5.2% vs. 0.9 +/- 1.9%),
      whereas DKG was not detected in C. When compared to serum levels before the start
      of dialysis, serum AA, DHA and DKG concentrations at the end of the dialysis
      session decreased by an average of 74.2, 84.0 and 78.8% respectively. In HD
      patients, serum levels of thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) were
      significantly lower in the higher AA (> 80 microM) group than in the deficient
      and normal-range AA groups. In 12 AA-deficient patients, after 1 month of taking 
      AA supplements (200 mg/day), serum AA levels rose to 79.9 microM, while serum
      TBARS level declined when compared with levels before supplementation. In
      conclusion, the frequency of AA deficiency in dialysis patients is extremely
      high. AA deficiency in HD patients may result in high TBARS levels, which reflect
      increased oxidative stress. Adequate AA supplementation should therefore be
      considered in such patients.

TI  - Association of pelvic arterial calcification with arteriovenous thigh graft
      failure in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 2564-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial calcification is a common problem in patients with chronic
      kidney disease, and has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The goal 
      of the present study was to evaluate whether pelvic artery calcifications are
      associated with technical failure of arteriovenous thigh grafts in haemodialysis 
      patients. METHODS: From 1 January 1999 to 30 June 2002, thigh grafts were placed 
      in 54 haemodialysis patients who had exhausted all options for permanent vascular
      access in the upper extremities. Perioperative computed tomography (CT) of the
      abdomen and pelvis was obtained in 32 of the patients for diagnostic purposes
      unrelated to vascular access planning. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the 
      graft outcomes, scored the vascular calcifications on CT of the distal aorta,
      common iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries on a semi-quantitative
      5-point scale. The association between technical graft failure (inability to
      complete the anastomosis) and the vascular calcification score was analysed.
      RESULTS: There was a high inter-observer agreement in scoring vascular
      calcification (kappa = 0.801). Among 26 patients with absent or mild pelvic
      arterial calcifications (grade 1-2) on CT, none (0%) experienced technical graft 
      failure. In contrast, three of six patients (50%) with moderate to severe
      calcification (grade 3-5) had technical graft failures (P = 0.004 by Fisher's
      exact test). The cumulative 1 year graft patency was lower in the group with
      grade 3-5 calcification (33 vs 81%, P = 0.09). The two groups were similar in
      age, gender, race, diabetes, duration of dialysis, serum calcium, serum
      phosphorus and serum parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSION: There is a strong
      association between pelvic artery calcifications and technical failure of thigh
      grafts. The presence of moderate to severe vascular calcification is predictive
      of poor cumulative 1 year graft patency.

TI  - Coronary and aortic calcifications in patients new to dialysis.
PG  - 265-72
LID - 10.1111/j.1492-7535.2004.01104.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification has been associated with all cause and
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESRD).
      Whether vascular calcification is present in persons with advanced chronic kidney
      disease starting dialysis or develops in patients on dialysis is unknown. The
      purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of vascular and coronary
      calcification in patients new to hemodialysis. METHODS: A total of 129 subjects
      new to dialysis were evaluated using electron beam computed tomography. The
      primary outcome was the presence and extent of coronary artery, aortic, and
      valvular calcification. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of subjects had no
      significant coronary artery calcification (total score </= 30) and 27% had no
      detectable aortic calcification. Thirty-four percent had coronary artery scores
      that placed them above the 90th percentile for age and sex. Coronary artery
      calcification was significantly associated with a history of coronary artery
      disease and atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD) whereas aortic calcification 
      was significantly associated with ASVD. Age (p < 0.0001), pulse pressure (p =
      0.004), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.009), and a history of smoking (p = 0.026) were 
      independently associated with the extent of coronary artery calcification. Age (p
      < 0.0001) and pulse pressure (p = 0.0003) were independently associated with the 
      extent of aortic calcification. CONCLUSIONS: A large fraction of patients new to 
      hemodialysis had no evidence of coronary artery or aortic calcification. Coupled 
      with the extensive vascular calcification reported by others in prevalent
      dialysis patients these findings suggest that dialysis-specific factors
      contribute to calcific vascular disease in ESRD.

TI  - A simple vascular calcification score predicts cardiovascular risk in
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1480-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in
      haemodialysis (HD) patients and have been recently associated with vascular
      calcifications. The objective of our study was to assess the value of a simple
      vascular calcification score for the prediction of cardiovascular death,
      cardiovascular hospitalizations and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in 
      HD patients, and to correlate this score with cardiovascular disease and with
      other known predictors of vascular disease. METHODS: In this observational,
      prospective study 123 chronic HD patients (75 males and 48 females; 20% diabetic)
      were included, who were on low-flux HD treatment for 46.6+/-52 months
      (mean+/-SD). We set up a simple vascular calcification score based on plain
      radiographic films of pelvis and hands. Brachial pulse pressure and mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) were measured and cardiovascular events and hospitalization
      episodes were assessed. RESULTS: During an observational period of 37 months
      there were 17 cardiovascular deaths; 28 patients needed cardiovascular
      hospitalizations and 32 patients suffered fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular
      events. Coronary artery disease was diagnosed in 43 patients (35%), peripheral
      arterial disease in 33 patients (26.8%), cerebrovascular disease in 16 patients
      (13%) and vascular disease (coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial
      disease or cerebral vascular disease) in 61 patients (49.6%). By binary logistic 
      regression, diabetes (P = 0.01), male sex (P<0.001), age (P = 0.02), HD duration 
      (P = 0.02) and MAP (P = 0.03) were independently associated with a vascular score
      > or =3. This score > or =3 was independently associated with coronary artery
      disease (P = 0.008), peripheral arterial disease (P<0.001) and vascular disease
      (P = 0.001). Patients with a vascular calcification score > or =3 had a 3.9-fold 
      higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.03), a 2.8-fold higher risk of
      cardiovascular hospitalizations (P = 0.02) and a 2.3-fold higher risk of fatal or
      non-fatal cardiovascular events (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The present vascular
      calcification scoring represents a simple tool for the assessment of
      cardiovascular risk related with vascular calcifications in chronic HD patients.

TI  - Patency and limb salvage rates after distal revascularization to unclampable
      calcified outflow arteries.
PG  - 539-46
AB  - PURPOSE: Severe circumferential calcification of the outflow artery during
      lower-extremity distal revascularization is considered a poor prognostic factor
      for bypass graft patency. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of
      circumferential infrapopliteal arterial calcification on bypass graft patency and
      limb salvage rates, comparing patency and limb salvage rates in unclampable
      calcified distal outflow arteries with those observed in uncalcified distal
      outflow arteries. METHODS: From July 1990 to July 1997, of 441 distal bypass
      graft procedures performed by the same surgeon, 69 (16%, group I) involved
      unclampable calcified outflow vessels, whereas 83 (19%, group II) outflow vessels
      were uncalcified; the other 289 (65%) had varying intermediate degrees of
      calcification and were not included in this analysis. All procedures were
      performed for limb-threatening ischemia and involved standard vein patch
      angioplasty of the distal anastomotic site, irrespective of the conduit used.
      Primary and secondary patency, limb salvage, and survival rates were assessed by 
      using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Groups were similar with regard to age,
      sex, and atherosclerotic risk factors except for a higher incidence of diabetes
      mellitus (88% vs 65%, P =.001) and renal failure (17% vs 5%, P =.01), including
      dialysis dependency (P =.01) in group I. Gangrene as an indication for surgery
      was statistically more frequent in group I (49% vs 29%, P =.01). The distal
      anastomotic locations and types of conduit involved were similar in the two
      groups. The femoral inflow level was used more often in group II (63% vs 38%, P
      =.003), the popliteal in group I (32% vs 17%, P =.03). Follow-up ranged from 30
      days to 144 months, with a mean of 69 months. None of the patients were lost
      during the follow-up period. None of the patients died during the perioperative
      (30-day) period. Primary patency rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 84%, 65%, and
      52% for group I and 89%, 76%, and 69% for group II (P =.07.). Secondary patency
      rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 96%, 82%, and 78% for group I and 96%, 85%, and
      82% for group II (P =.58). Limb salvage rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 93%, 83%,
      and 81% for group I and 97%, 90%, and 86% for group II (P =.39). CONCLUSIONS:
      Distal revascularization to unclampable, severely calcified outflow arteries can 
      achieve much the same results to those obtained in uncalcified outflow arteries. 
      A circumferentially calcified distal recipient artery should not be considered a 
      major obstacle to an attempt at limb salvage bypass graft surgery.

TI  - Carotid atherosclerosis in chronic renal failure-the central role of increased
      plaque burden.
PG  - 295-302
AB  - Studies on carotid artery atherosclerosis have been performed in order to
      understand the high risk for cardiovascular disease in chronic renal failure
      (CRF). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent and nature of carotid
      artery atherosclerosis in patients with CRF. Of the 135 patients with CRF (52 +/-
      11 years), 58 had moderate to severe predialysis CRF (PR), 36 were on dialysis
      treatment (DI), and 41 were renal transplant recipients (TR). In addition, 58
      control subjects (CO) were examined. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness
      (IMT), plaque prevalence, plaque score, and stiffness index beta were determined.
      Furthermore, plaque calcification and internal carotid artery stenoses were
      classified. Plaque prevalence (PR 64%, DI 61%, TR 51%, CO 28%; P < 0.001) and
      plaque score (PR 3.3 +/- 4.3, DI 3.0 +/- 3.4, TR 2.5 +/- 3.2, CO 0.8 +/- 1.7 mm; 
      P < 0.001) were significantly greater in the CRF patient groups compared to the
      controls, whereas no difference in IMT was noted between the study groups. The
      prevalences of plaque calcification and internal carotid artery stenoses were
      higher among the CRF patient groups. In addition, the stiffness index beta was
      higher in the CRF patient groups. The present study shows that the characteristic
      alterations of the carotid arteries in CRF include increased plaque burden,
      calcification and increased arterial stiffness.

TI  - [Proposal of a clinical prediction score for atheromatous renal artery stenosis].
PG  - 784-7
AB  - UNLABELLED: Renal vascular pathologies are important causes of the chronic renal 
      failure progression. This work aims to define retrospectively a score based on
      simple clinical and paraclinical helping to select atheromatous renal stenosis
      affected patients; 67 patients more than 50 years old have been explored by
      arteriography because of degradation of the renal function or hypertension: 45 of
      them had one, or many, significant stenosis of the renal arteries. Were analyzed:
      clinical data: age, weight, sex, blood pressure, previous ateromatous lesions
      (cardiac, peripheral, aortic), smoking, associated diabetes; biological data:
      serum cholesterol and creatinine, creatinine variation under
      angiotensin-coverting enzyme inhibitor or sodium depletion, kaliemia; radiologic 
      data: kidney size through scanning, renal arterial and aortic calcifications on
      abdominal plain films and profile. The group with and without stenosis differed
      considerably for age (68.9 vs 64 years old, p < 0.05), smoking (26.3 vs 11.5
      packet-year, p < 0.001), variation of creatinine after sensibilisation (140
      mumol/l vs 17 mumol/l, p < 0.001), presence of arterial calcification (p <
      0.001). A score taking in to account these four criteria was established with
      performances in terms of specificity and sensibility amounted to 83%. CONCLUSION:
      The reliable aspect of this score enabling to define a group seriously risking a 
      renal stenosis must be checked through a prospective study.

TI  - Arterial media calcification in end-stage renal disease: impact on all-cause and 
      cardiovascular mortality.
PG  - 1731-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cross-sectional and follow-up studies on end-stage renal disease
      patients showed that arterial calcifications are associated with cardiovascular
      (CV) morbidity and are an independent predictor of all-cause and CV mortality.
      However, these studies did not examine the impact on prognosis according to the
      type of calcification, i.e. intimal vs medial. Arterial media calcification
      (AMC), a non-occlusive condition, affects haemodynamics differently from arterial
      intima calcification (AIC), which occurs in atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of
      this study was to investigate the prognostic value of AMC in relationship to
      all-cause or CV mortality for stable haemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We
      included 202 such patients in the present study. At baseline, soft-tissue native 
      radiograms of the pelvis and the thigh were analysed for the presence and type
      (AMC vs AIC) of arterial calcifications. All patients underwent B-mode
      ultrasonography of the common carotid artery to determine the presence of
      atherosclerotic calcified plaques, measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity and 
      echocardiography. RESULTS: AIC was usually observed in older patients with a
      clinical history of atherosclerosis before starting HD treatment and typical risk
      factors associated with atherosclerotic disease. AMC was observed in young and
      middle-aged patients without conventional atherosclerotic risk factors. AMC was
      closely associated with the duration of HD and calcium-phosphate disorders,
      including the oral dose of elemental calcium prescribed as phosphate binder
      (CaCO(3)). Compared to patients with AIC, patients with AMC had a longer
      survival, but in turn their survival was significantly shorter than that of
      patients without calcifications. CONCLUSIONS: AMC is a strong prognostic marker
      of all-cause and CV mortality in HD patients, independently of classical
      atherogenic factors. The principal effect of AMC on arterial function is
      increased arterial stiffness.

TI  - The effects of sevelamer and calcium acetate on proxies of atherosclerotic and
      arteriosclerotic vascular disease in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently determined that in hemodialysis patients, the use of
      calcium salts to correct hyperphosphatemia led to progressive coronary artery and
      aortic calcification as determined by sequential electron beam tomography (EBT)
      while the use of the non-calcium-containing binder sevelamer did not. Whether the
      specific calcium preparation (acetate vs. carbonate) might influence the
      likelihood of progressive calcification was debated. METHODS: To determine
      whether treatment with calcium acetate was specifically associated with
      hypercalcemia and progressive vascular calcification, we conducted an analysis
      restricted to 108 hemodialysis patients randomized to calcium acetate or
      sevelamer and followed for one year. RESULTS: The reduction in serum phosphorus
      was roughly equivalent with both agents (calcium acetate -2.5 +/- 1.8 mg/dl vs.
      sevelamer -2.8 +/- 2.0 mg/dl, p = 0.53). Subjects given calcium acetate were more
      likely to develop hypercalcemia (defined as an albumin-corrected serum calcium > 
      or =10.5 mg/dl) (36 vs. 13%, p = 0.015). Treatment with calcium acetate (mean 4.6
      +/- 2.1 g/day - equivalent to 1.2 +/- 0.5 g of elemental calcium) led to a
      significant increase in EBT-determined calcification of the coronary arteries
      (mean change 182 +/- 350, median change +20, p = 0.002) and aorta (mean change
      181 +/- 855, median change +73, p < 0.0001). These changes were similar in
      magnitude to those seen with calcium carbonate. There were no significant changes
      in calcification among sevelamer-treated subjects. CONCLUSION: Despite purported 
      differences in safety and efficacy relative to calcium carbonate, calcium acetate
      led to hypercalcemia and progressive vascular calcification in hemodialysis
      patients.

TI  - Coronary artery, aortic wall, and valvular calcification in nondialyzed
      individuals with type 2 diabetes and renal disease.
PG  - 263-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have highly prevalent
      and severe vascular and valvular calcification. We undertook this study to test
      the hypothesis that vascular and valvular calcification begins and is often
      severe long before diabetic renal disease progresses to ESRD. METHODS: A total of
      32 nondialyzed individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic renal
      disease (albumin excretion rate>30 microg/min) [mean glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR), 49.8 +/- 6.1 mL/min/1.73 m2] were identified and compared with a group of 
      18 normoalbuminuric diabetics. We used 3:1 matching to identify 95 nondiabetic
      controls without renal disease, matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and the
      presence/absence of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and known coronary artery disease
      (CAD). RESULTS: Using electron beam computed tomography (CT), the prevalence of
      coronary artery calcification was significantly greater among diabetic renal
      disease individuals (prevalence, 94% vs. 59%, P < 0.001; median score, 238 vs.
      10, P < 0.001) than the nondiabetic controls. The coronary artery calcification
      scores were significantly more severe among diabetic renal disease individuals
      than either the diabetic or nondiabetic controls. Among individuals with diabetic
      renal disease, the coronary artery calcification and aortic wall calcification
      scores were several-fold greater among those with known CAD than among those
      without. There was also a significantly greater prevalence of aortic and mitral
      valve calcification among diabetic renal disease individuals than nondiabetic
      controls (aortic, 23% vs. 6%, P = 0.03; mitral, 25% vs. 2%, P < 0.001).
      Multivariate analysis using all three groups reproduced these findings and also
      consistently identified age and diabetic renal disease as additional predictors
      for the presence or severity of coronary artery and aortic wall calcification.
      CONCLUSION: In this first, systematic analysis among nondialyzed individuals with
      diabetic renal disease, these data demonstrate that vascular and valvular
      calcification is present and often severe long before the disease progresses to
      ESRD. The data also suggest that the coronary artery and aortic wall
      calcification may represent atherosclerosis.

TI  - [Prevalence of vertebral fractures and aortic calcifications in hemodialysis
      patients: comparison with a population of the same age and sex].
PG  - 106-11
AB  - Dialysis patients have bone metabolic disorders and a higher prevalence of
      fractures, principally peripheral fractures. However, there are few studies
      focusing on the prevalence of vertebral fractures. Moreover, aortic
      calcifications are very common and are an independent predictive factor of
      vascular morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the
      prevalence of vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications in haemodialysis
      (HD) patients (n = 99), in comparison with a random sample of general population 
      of similar age and from the same geographical area (n = 624) and study their
      relationship with clinical, biochemical and therapeutical data. The prevalence of
      vertebral fractures in HD patients and general population was 19.1% and 24.1%
      respectively (non-significant statistical differences). In both, sexes, the
      presence of vertebral fractures was positively associated with age, mean maximum 
      Ca, mean maximum CaxP. In women, time in HD was positively associated as well. On
      the other hand, the prevalence of aortic calcifications was much higher in HD
      patients (77.9% vs 37.5%, p < 0.001). HD was a risk factor for aortic
      calcification in women [OR = 7.7 (IC 95% = 2.6-22.9)] as in men [OR = 5 (IC 95% =
      1.9-12.9)]. Severe vascular calcifications were more frequent in HD patients, it 
      reached 57.4% compared with 17% of general population (p < 0.001). Both, in women
      (64.5% vs 13.3% p < 0.001) and in men (51.4% vs 20.9%), respectively (p < 0.001).
      In conclusion, the prevalence of vertebral fractures was similar in HD patients
      and in general population. Nevertheless, frequency and severity of aortic
      calcifications was higher in HD patients.

TI  - [Atherosclerosis and uremia: signifance of non-traditional risk factors].
PG  - 220-34
AB  - Arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are causally related
      to the high morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic renal failure.
      Oxidative stress and carbonyl stress of uremia, dialysis procedure and/or
      intravenous iron therapy result in AGE (advanced glycation end-product), ALE
      (advanced lipoxidation end-product) and AOPP (advanced oxidation protein product)
      formation, favouring together with elevated CRP (C-reactive protein) levels the
      development of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. Enhanced plasma 
      levels of homocysteine and ADMA (asymmetric dimethylarginine) contribute to this 
      process. In addition, in chronic renal insufficiency hyperphosphatemia and an
      enhanced calcium x phosphorus ion product are associated with the morbidity and
      mortality of the patients, particularly in the presence of fetuin deficiency.
      Phosphorus, AGEs and AOPPs, beside other factors, catalyze the conversion of
      vascular smooth muscle cells to osteoblast--like cells (particularly in the
      presence of monocytes/macrophages), resulting in bone matrix protein formation.
      Other risk factors, such as age, male sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes,
      chronic inflammation, insulin resistance or dyslipidemia (enhanced
      non-HDL-cholesterol) also contribute to the atherosclerotic risk profile of the
      patient with chronic renal insufficiency. While there is growing understanding of
      the mechanisms involved in arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis and vascular
      calcification in uremia, we are still missing effective therapeutic maneuvers for
      reduction of excess mortality in uremic patients.

TI  - Vascular calcification in the uremic patient: a cardiovascular risk?
PG  - S119-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several factors suggest that the presence of vascular calcification
      (VC) is associated with a high risk of cardiac events in uremic patients. The aim
      of this study was to analyze the influence of VC on cardiac morbidity and
      mortality in our hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We studied 79 patients on
      HD: 43 males, mean age 48 +/- 15 years old, mean time on HD 83 +/- 63 months. The
      presence of VC was evaluated by radiologic series. Other cardiovascular risk
      factors analyzed were arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity,
      cigarette smoking, anemia, and dyslipidemia. All patients underwent M-mode,
      two-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography. Patients were followed for two years. 
      During this time, clinical information collected included predialysis blood
      pressure, incidence of ischemic heart disease, episodes of congestive heart
      failure, and mortality due to cardiovascular event. RESULTS: VC was observed in
      55.7% of patients. Left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and
      cardiac valve calcification were significantly associated with VC. Ischemic heart
      disease (71.4% vs. 28.6%) and episodes of cardiac failure (0.41 vs. 0.18 per
      year; P < 0.05) appeared more frequently in the patient group with VC. VC was
      present in 80.6% of patients who developed episodes of heart failure. Eight
      patients died from cardiac disease; each of them had VC. CONCLUSION: The presence
      of VC can help to identify those HD patients with a higher cardiovascular risk.

TI  - Assessment of vascular calcification in ESRD patients using spiral CT.
PG  - 1152-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dialysis patients have increased vascular calcification of the
      coronary arteries and aorta by electron beam CT scan. The purpose of the present 
      study was to utilize an alternative machine, spiral CT, to assess calcification
      in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. METHODS: Two groups of patients with 
      ESRD were evaluated: group 1, those receiving a renal transplant (n=38); and
      group 2, those remaining on dialysis (n=33). All patients underwent quad-slice
      spiral CT with retrospective gating to evaluate coronary artery and aorta
      calcification scores. Both area (Agatston method) and volume calculations were
      utilized, with retrospective gating in all but 16 subjects. Laboratory tests,
      medications and clinical characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: Using spiral CT,
      the intra-reader variability for coronary artery calcification (after correction 
      for very low scores) was 0.9% mean / 0% median using the area (Agatston method)
      and 2.9% mean / 0% median using volume calculations. Group 1 patients were
      younger, more likely to be Caucasian and on peritoneal dialysis, had lower serum 
      calcium and higher C-reactive protein levels than group 2. In patients without vs
      those with coronary artery calcification, only longer duration of dialysis
      (34+/-64 vs 55+/-50 months, P=0.004; r=0.39, P=0.005) and increasing age (39+/-13
      vs 54+/-10 years, P<0.001; r=0.29, P=0.039) were associated, whereas only
      increasing age was associated with aorta calcification. CONCLUSION: In ESRD
      patients, the factors correlating with coronary calcification were duration of
      dialysis and advancing age, whereas only age correlated with aorta calcification.
      Spiral CT offers an alternative technique for the assessment of these changes.

      report].
PG  - 200-4
AB  - Isolated peripheral arterial ischaemia (IPAI) is an unusual pathology of dialysis
      and peritoneal patients which represents the first sign of a complication of
      uraemia known as calciphylaxis. Recent studies have revealed an increased
      incidence of this complication. Risk factors are known but there is no consensus 
      on them: elevated CaxP product, female gender, elevated serum parathormone. We
      present here the case of a 65-year-old man with 21-year history of dialysis,
      distal isolated ulceration and without any signs of severe vasculopathy. Our
      clinical diagnosis was calciphylaxis. In this case, the role of early PTX is not 
      clear and the use of steroids is recommended only in non-ulcerating cases. The
      therapy gives good results but not in all patients. Electrical stimulation of the
      posterior roots of the spinal cord is an alternative approach to this case. We
      hypothesised that the electrical action, through cutaneous vasodilatation of
      afferent dorsal fibres and release of calcitonin gene-releasing protein,
      determines the release of prostaglandin E sub 2 that may positively affect the
      proliferation and activity of epidermal fibroblasts.

TI  - Association of low fetuin-A (AHSG) concentrations in serum with cardiovascular
      mortality in patients on dialysis: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 827-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is the most prominent underlying pathological 
      finding in patients with uraemia, and is a predictor of mortality in this
      population. Fetuin-A (alpha2-Heremans Schmid glycoprotein; AHSG) is an important 
      circulating inhibitor of calcification in vivo, and is downregulated during the
      acute-phase response. We aimed to investigate the hypothesis that AHSG deficiency
      is directly related to uraemic vascular calcification. METHODS: We did a
      cross-sectional study in 312 stable patients on haemodialysis to analyse the
      inter-relation of AHSG and C-reactive protein (CRP) and their predictive effect
      on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, over a period of 32 months.
      Subsequently, we tested the capacity of serum to inhibit CaxPO4 precipitation in 
      patients on long-term dialysis (n=17) with apparent soft-tissue calcifications,
      and in those on short-term dialysis (n=8) without evidence of calcifications and 
      cardiovascular disease. FINDINGS: AHSG concentrations in serum were significantly
      lower in patients on haemodialysis (mean 0.66 g/L [SD 0.28]) than in healthy
      controls (0.72 [0.19]). Low concentrations of the glycoprotein were associated
      with raised amounts of CRP and with enhanced cardiovascular (p=0.031) and
      all-cause mortality (p=0.0013). Sera from patients on long-term dialysis with low
      AHSG concentrations showed impaired ex-vivo capacity to inhibit CaxPO4
      precipitation (mean IC50: 9.0 microL serum [SD 3.1] vs 7.5 [0.8] in short-term
      patients and 6.4 [2.6] in controls). Reconstitution of sera with purified AHSG
      returned this impairment to normal. Interpretation AHSG deficiency is associated 
      with inflammation and links vascular calcification to mortality in patients on
      dialysis. Activated acute-phase response and AHSG deficiency might account for
      accelerated atherosclerosis in uraemia.

TI  - Effect of the duration of dialysis on survival in a cohort of chronic
      haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 782-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are common in chronic
      haemodialysis (HD) patients, and usually progress with time. Whether the length
      of dialysis treatment in chronic HD patients is a significant independent risk
      factor of death is not clear. METHODS: A cohort of chronic HD patients from the
      Okinawa Dialysis Study, n=1243 (720 men, 523 women), was followed from January
      1991 to December 2000, and their survival rates were compared against the
      duration of HD, which was calculated in months from the start of dialysis therapy
      to January 1991. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was done to
      examine the influence of the duration of dialysis on survival, after adjusting
      for other factors such as age, sex, serum albumin concentration and diastolic
      blood pressure. The hazards ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were
      calculated in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. RESULTS: The mean duration
      of dialysis was 61.9 months and ranged from 1 to 233 months. The numbers of
      patients who died, underwent renal transplantation or were transferred outside
      Okinawa were 568 (45.7%), 61 (4.9%) and 14 (1.1%), respectively, during the
      study. The hazards ratio (95% CI) was 1.002 (1.000-1.004, P=0.0245) for
      non-diabetic patients and 1.006 (1.001-1.011, P=0.0214) for diabetic patients,
      suggesting that the longer the duration of dialysis, the greater the risk of
      death. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that prolonged dialysis is a significant
      predictor of death in chronic HD patients, in particular diabetic patients.
      Whether this is related to the progression of the atherosclerotic process or to
      uraemic conditions remains to be shown.

TI  - Usefulness of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity measurement: correlation with
      abdominal aortic calcification.
PG  - 163-7
AB  - At present, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) can be measured easily and
      noninvasively. We studied the correlation between aortic damage estimated by
      baPWV and that determined by measuring the length of abdominal aortic
      calcification (AAC) on X-ray films, which parameter has been significantly
      associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. baPWV was measured using 
      the form PWV/ankle brachial index (ABI) device in 97 patients free of end-stage
      renal failure or peripheral arterial disease. baPWV correlated significantly with
      age (r2=0.625, p<0.0001), was significantly higher in hypertensives than in
      normotensives (2,109+/-67 vs. 1,623+/-93 cm/s, p<0.0001), and correlated
      significantly with systolic blood pressure (r2=0.64, p<0.0001) and diastolic
      blood pressure (r2=0.397, p<0.0001). baPWV was significantly higher in diabetic
      patients than in nondiabetics (2,068+/-73 vs. 1,813+/-97 cm/s, p<0.05), but was
      similar in normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic patients. baPWV did not correlate
      with body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, high density
      lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol or
      triglyceride levels, but correlated significantly with AAC length (r2=0.599,
      p<0.0001). Multiple regression analysis indicated that age, systolic blood
      pressure and AAC length were independent determinants of baPWV. Our results
      indicate that baPWV is useful for estimating aortic damage and could be a
      potentially useful predictor of vascular morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Off-pump coronary surgery: surgical strategy for the high-risk patient.
PG  - 75-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In a retrospective study, we compared two groups of consecutive
      patients operated by the same team during the year 2000 for coronary artery
      disease with the use of extracorporeal circulation (group 1, n=230) or on the
      beating heart using the Octopus II plus stabiliser (group 2, n=228). High-risk
      patients were identified by a EuroSCORE plus 6. EuroSCORE definitions and
      predicted risk models were utilized to compare the variables of the groups.
      METHODS: There were no significant differences between the preoperative variables
      of the groups in age, gender, left ventricular function, diabetes and peripheral 
      vascular and renal disease as is indicated by the Euroscore (resp. 4.7/5.1
      p=0.107). Calcification of the ascending aorta and chronic obstructive lung
      disease were statistically significant more prevalent in the beating heart group.
      No differences in preoperative variables in the high-risk patients group
      (Euroscore 8.5/8.1 p=0.356) except for calcification of the ascending aorta.
      RESULTS: All patients underwent a full revascularisation through a midline
      sternotomy. Significant more distal anastomoses were performed in group 1 (3.7
      per patient (1-6)) with regard to group 2 (2.9 per patient (1-6)). Anesthesia,
      postoperative treatment and follow up were equal for both groups. A significant
      lower incidence of atrial fibrillation (p=0.010), shorter ICU stay (p=0.031) and 
      renal insufficiency (p=0.033) was reported in group 2. In the low risk group, we 
      could not diagnose any difference between the two groups, except for atrial
      fibrillation. The benefits of the beating heart surgery however were more
      pronounced in the high-risk patient as is indicated by a significant reduction of
      the ICU stay by 1 day (3.5d/2.5d (p=0.028)), better preservation of the renal
      function (p=0.017) and a significant reduction of the length of hospital stay by 
      more than two days (p=0.040). A lower incidence of atrial fibrillation, however
      not significant. CONCLUSION: In our experience, beating heart surgery is a safe
      alternative for conventional coronary heart surgery. High-risk patients do
      benefit most from this technique. It became our first choice in the elderly
      patient and patients presenting with higher co-morbidities.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcification as an important predictor for all-cause mortality and
      cardiovascular mortality in long-term peritoneal dialysis patients: a prospective
      study.
PG  - 159-68
AB  - Calcification complications are frequent among long-term dialysis patients.
      However, the prognostic implication of cardiac valve calcification in this
      population is not known. This study aimed to determine if cardiac valve
      calcification predicts mortality in long-term dialysis patients. Baseline
      echocardiography was performed in 192 patients (mean +/- SD age, 55 +/- 12 yr) on
      continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (mean +/- SD duration of dialysis, 39
      +/- 31 mo) to screen for calcification of the aortic valve, mitral valve, or
      both. Valvular calcification was present in 62 patients. During the mean
      follow-up of 17.9 mo (range, 0.6 to 33.9 mo), 46 deaths (50% of cardiovascular
      causes) were observed. Overall 1-yr survival was 70% and 93% for patients with
      and without valvular calcification (P < 0.0001, log-rank test). Cardiovascular
      mortality was 22% and 3% for patients with and without valvular calcification (P 
      < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that cardiac valve
      calcification was predictive of an increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio
      [HR], 2.50; 95% CI, 1.32 to 4.76; P = 0.005) and cardiovascular death (HR 5.39;
      95% CI, 2.16 to 13.48; P = 0.0003) independent of age, male gender, dialysis
      duration, C-reactive protein, diabetes, and atherosclerotic vascular disease.
      Eighty-nine percent of patients with both valvular calcification and
      atherosclerotic vascular disease, 23% of patients with valvular calcification
      only, 21% of patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease only, and 13% of
      patients with neither complication died at 1-yr (P < 0.0005). The cardiovascular 
      death rate was 85% for patients with both complications, 13% for patients with
      valvular calcification only, 14% for patients with atherosclerotic vascular
      disease only, and 5% for those with neither complication (P < 0.0005). The number
      of calcified valves was associated with all-cause mortality (P < 0.0005) and
      cardiovascular death (P < 0.0005). One-year all-cause mortality was 57% for
      patients with both aortic and mitral valves calcified, 40% for those with either 
      valve calcified, and 15% for those with neither valve calcified. In conclusion,
      cardiac valve calcification is a powerful predictor for mortality and
      cardiovascular deaths in long-term dialysis patients. Valvular calcification by
      itself has similar prognostic importance as the presence of atherosclerotic
      vascular disease. Its coexistence with other atherosclerotic complications
      indicates more severe disease and has the worst outcome.

TI  - Prevalence and progression of peripheral arterial calcifications in patients with
      ESRD.
PG  - 140-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial calcifications are seen frequently in patients
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, prevalence and progression, as well
      as contributing factors, never were investigated in an unselected incident cohort
      of dialysis patients. METHODS: We investigated 155 patients with ESRD at the
      beginning of dialysis therapy and followed them up prospectively during the first
      year of either hemodialysis (n = 106) or peritoneal dialysis treatment (n = 49). 
      The prevalence and progression of arterial calcifications during the first year
      were graded by a single radiologist on standardized plain radiographs of the
      pelvis and calves. Findings were analyzed in relation to sex, age, diabetes
      mellitus, dialysis modality, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      levels, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) level, apolipoprotein(a) kringle-IV repeat
      polymorphism, calcium level, phosphorus level, intact parathyroid hormone level, 
      and homocysteine level. RESULTS: Patients with peripheral arterial calcifications
      at the start of renal replacement therapy (RRT) (n = 104) were significantly
      older (P < 0.001), had diabetes more often (P < 0.001), and had greater Lp(a)
      concentrations (P = 0.03) and a trend to greater total cholesterol
      concentrations. Patients with progression of calcifications during the first year
      of RRT had significantly greater homocysteine levels (P = 0.036). Logistic
      regression analysis showed that patients without calcifications either at the
      beginning or after 1 year of RRT were younger (P = 0.01) and had significantly
      lower homocysteine (P = 0.004) and Lp(a) levels (P = 0.03) and less frequently
      had diabetes mellitus (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that the
      prevalence of peripheral arterial calcifications in patients with ESRD is related
      to age, diabetes mellitus, and Lp(a) and homocysteine levels. Progression of
      arterial calcifications might be related to high plasma homocysteine
      concentrations.

TI  - Association of calcium channel blockers and mortality in haemodialysis patients.
PG  - 511-5
AB  - Patients with end-stage renal disease show disturbances of calcium metabolism,
      including calcification of arterial walls. Such patients show increased
      mortality, in particular due to increased cardiovascular-associated deaths. The
      association of calcium channel blockers and mortality in patients undergoing
      haemodialysis was investigated. A total of 188 patients who were receiving
      haemodialysis as of July 1998 were followed up for 30 months. Baseline
      characteristics, including age, sex, laboratory and clinical data, medication and
      dialysis prescription, were obtained. As of December 2000, 51 of the patients
      (27%) had died. In the deceased group, age was significantly higher, body mass
      index was significantly lower, and smoking was significantly more frequent
      compared with the survival group (each P <0.001). The percentage of patients
      taking calcium channel blockers was significantly higher in the survival group.
      Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that haemodialysis patients
      assigned calcium channel blocker therapy had a significantly lower risk of
      mortality [relative risk 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.67); P <0.001].
      Thus, in haemodialysis patients who were at high risk of cardiovascular events,
      administration of calcium channel blockers was associated with lower mortality.

TI  - Different risk factors for peripheral vascular calcification between diabetic and
      non-diabetic haemodialysis patients--importance of glycaemic control.
PG  - 1446-8
AB  - AIM/HYPOTHESIS: Although derangements of calcium and phosphate control have been 
      emphasized as important risk factors for vascular calcification in non-diabetic
      haemodialysis patients, similar risk factors for diabetic haemodialysis patients 
      are not known. We compared factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification
      between haemodialysis patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: We examined
      421 patients on maintenance haemodialysis. There were 89 patients with Type II
      (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (53 men and 36 women, 62+/-10 years
      old) and 332 patients without diabetes (192 men and 140 women, 59+/-13 years
      old). Hand roentgenography was carried out, and visible vascular calcification of
      the hand arteries was evaluated. RESULTS: There were 42 diabetic patients and 45 
      non-diabetic patients with vascular calcification. The prevalence of vascular
      calcification in diabetic patients (47.1%) was higher than in non-diabetic
      patients (13.6%) ( p<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression, the main
      factors affecting vascular calcification in non-diabetic patients were advanced
      age, longer duration of haemodialysis, increased phosphate concentrations, male
      gender, and lower predialysis diastolic pressure. In diabetic patients,
      predictors for vascular calcification were higher values of HbA(1C) and longer
      duration of haemodialysis. In diabetic patients, a 1% increase in HbA(1C)
      increased the risk of calcification by 2.1-fold (95% CI 1.282-3.575, p=0.0029).
      CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We have shown that poor glycaemic control, rather than
      calcium and phosphate concentrations, is a predictor of peripheral vascular
      calcification in diabetic patients on haemodialysis. This study emphasizes that
      glycaemic control remains critical even in diabetic patients with end-stage renal
      disease.

TI  - Aortic valve calcification is an independent factor of left ventricular
      hypertrophy in patients on maintenance haemodialysis.
PG  - 1795-801
AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcification and dysfunction of aortic and mitral valves are
      frequently found in chronic dialysis patients, but their influence on the
      development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is not well defined. METHODS:
      Conventional echocardiography and Doppler measurement of trans-aortic flow
      velocity were performed in 135 chronic haemodialysis patients, and left
      ventricular mass index (LVMI) and trans-valve pressure gradients were calculated.
      Average values of systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure (PP), interdialytic
      weight gain, chronic overhydration (difference between mean post-dialysis and dry
      weights), plasma calcium, phosphate, haemoglobin, and urea reduction ratio over
      the year preceding this study were obtained in every patient. RESULTS: Aortic
      valve calcification was present in 105 patients (78%), associated with stenosis
      in eight (6%); 39 patients (29%) had aortic regurgitation. Mitral annular
      calcification occurred in 35 (26%) cases and mitral regurgitation in 45 (33%).
      LVH was observed in 104 patients (77%). Logistic analysis revealed that only
      aortic valve calcification predicted LVH. LVMI was higher in patients with aortic
      valve calcification than in those without calcification: (mean+/-SD) 241+/-52 vs 
      154+/-64 g/m(2), P=0.001. LVMI was not different between patients with normal,
      calcified, or regurgitating mitral valves. Patients with aortic valve
      calcification had higher trans-valve peak flow velocities and pressure gradients 
      than those with non-calcified valves: 1.65+/-0.53 vs 1.37+/-0.33 m/s, P=0.01, and
      12.1+/-8.9 vs 7.9+/-3.6 mmHg, P=0.01, respectively. The LVMI correlated directly 
      with both variables (r=0.27 and r=0.24, P<0.005). Stepwise linear regression on
      nine covariates potentially influencing LVMI (age, body mass index, time on
      dialysis, systolic blood pressure, PP, chronic overhydration, haemoglobin
      concentration, trans-aortic flow velocity, and urea reduction ratio) showed that 
      LVMI was independently associated with (i) PP, (ii) haemoglobin (inverse
      correlation), (iii) peak aortic flow velocity, and (iv) chronic overhydration
      (r=0.502, R(2)=0.252, ANOVA F-ratio=10.19, P<0.0005). CONCLUSION: Our findings
      show that aortic valve calcification is associated with LVH in chronic
      haemodialysis patients, probably because valve resistance to ventricular outflow 
      is increased as shown by trans-aortic flow velocities and pressure gradients. The
      effect on LVMI is independent of PP, anaemia, and overhydration.

AB  - Vascular calcification is a frequent complication of uremic patients. In addition
      to classical risk factors such as age, male gender, smoking, inflammation,
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, which also exist in the general
      population, patients with chronic renal failure have other risk factors such as
      oxidative stress, inflammation, hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism,
      hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and overtreatment with calcium and vitamin D.
      These latter risk factors may even have a better predictive value than classical 
      risk factors for coronary heart disease in uremic patients.

AB  - Calciphylaxis is a small vessel vasculopathy involving mural calcification with
      intimal proliferation, fibrosis, and thrombosis. This syndrome occurs
      predominantly in individuals with renal failure and results in ischemia and
      necrosis of skin, subcutaneous fat, visceral organs, and skeletal muscle. The
      syndrome causes significant morbidity in the form of infection, organ failure,
      and pain. Mortality rates are high. In individuals with renal failure, risk
      factors for the development of calciphylaxis include female sex, Caucasian race, 
      obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Many cases occur within the first year of
      dialysis treatment. Several recent reports demonstrate that prolonged
      hyperphosphatemia and/or elevated calcium x phosphorus products are associated
      with the syndrome. Protein malnutrition increases the likelihood of
      calciphylaxis, as does warfarin use and hypercoagulable states, such as protein C
      and/or protein S deficiency. Recent advances in diagnostic tools and therapeutic 
      strategies have helped in the management of patients with calciphylaxis.

TI  - Advanced coronary and carotid arteriopathy in young adults with childhood-onset
      chronic renal failure.
PG  - 100-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular mortality is excessive in young adults with end-stage 
      renal disease (ESRD). The factors contributing to ESRD-related vascular disease
      are incompletely understood. Young adults with childhood-onset chronic renal
      failure (CRF) are uniquely suited for risk factor assessment because of their
      long-term exposure at an age when vascular pathology in the general population is
      still minimal. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used novel noninvasive technologies to
      screen for coronary and carotid artery disease in 39 patients with ESRD aged 19
      to 39 years with childhood-onset CRF presently treated by dialysis or renal
      transplantation. Coronary artery calcification burden was assessed by CT scan
      with ECG gating and the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid arteries by
      high-resolution ultrasound. Coronary artery calcifications were present in 92% of
      patients; calcium scores exceeded the 95th age- and sex-specific percentiles
      >10-fold on average. Carotid IMT was significantly increased compared with
      matched control subjects. Both coronary calcium scores and IMT were associated
      with cumulative dialysis and ESRD time and the cumulative serum calcium-phosphate
      product. Coronary calcium scores were strongly correlated with C-reactive protein
      and Chlamydia pneumoniae seropositivity, time-averaged mean serum parathyroid
      hormone, and plasma homocysteine. C-reactive protein and parathyroid hormone
      independently predicted coronary calcium accumulation. Smoking, obesity, and
      HbA1c were correlated with IMT in the control subjects but not in the patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Young adults with childhood-onset CRF have a high prevalence of
      arteriopathy associated with indicators of microinflammation,
      hyperparathyroidism, calcium-phosphate overload, and hyperhomocysteinemia but not
      traditional atherogenic risk factors. These risk factors persist even after
      successful renal transplantation.

TI  - Sevelamer attenuates the progression of coronary and aortic calcification in
      hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is frequent and severe in patients with
      end-stage renal disease. Disorders of mineral metabolism may contribute by
      promoting cardiovascular calcification. METHODS: We conducted a randomized
      clinical trial comparing sevelamer, a non-absorbed polymer, with calcium-based
      phosphate binders in 200 hemodialysis patients. Study outcomes included the
      targeted concentrations of serum phosphorus, calcium, and intact parathyroid
      hormone (PTH), and calcification of the coronary arteries and thoracic aorta
      using a calcification score derived from electron beam tomography. RESULTS:
      Sevelamer and calcium provided equivalent control of serum phosphorus
      (end-of-study values 5.1 +/- 1.2 and 5.1 +/- 1.4 mg/dL, respectively, P = 0.33). 
      Serum calcium concentration was significantly higher in the calcium-treated group
      (P = 0.002), and hypercalcemia was more common (16% vs. 5% with sevelamer, P =
      0.04). More subjects in the calcium group had end-of-study intact PTH below the
      target of 150 to 300 pg/mL (57% vs. 30%, P = 0.001). At study completion, the
      median absolute calcium score in the coronary arteries and aorta increased
      significantly in the calcium treated subjects but not in the sevelamer-treated
      subjects (coronary arteries 36.6 vs. 0, P = 0.03 and aorta 75.1 vs. 0, P = 0.01, 
      respectively). The median percent change in coronary artery (25% vs. 6%, P =
      0.02) and aortic (28% vs. 5%, P = 0.02) calcium score also was significantly
      greater with calcium than with sevelamer. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with
      calcium-based phosphate binders, sevelamer is less likely to cause hypercalcemia,
      low levels of PTH, and progressive coronary and aortic calcification in
      hemodialysis patients.

TI  - Case-control study of calcification of the hepatic artery in chronic hemodialysis
      patients: comparison with the abdominal aorta and splenic artery.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies of the hepatic artery are scarce. We have observed
      that hepatic artery calcification is very uncommon in patients with
      hyperparathyroidism that expedites calcification. METHODS: Plain abdominal CT was
      studied in 221 patients on chronic hemodialysis. Control consisted of 442 sex-
      and age-matched patients with other diseases. Calcification was graded as a
      percentage of the entire wall circumference for the aorta, and as a percentage of
      the entire length of the hepatic and splenic arteries from the celiac trunk to
      the hilum of each organ. RESULTS: Aortic calcification was seen in 79.2% of male 
      dialysis patients, 22.1% of controls, 74.1% of female dialysis patients and 17.3%
      of controls (P < 0.0001). Hepatic artery calcification was seen in only 13
      dialysis patients. The degree of calcification of the abdominal aorta was
      correlated with the length of hemodialysis period (P = 0.008), but not with serum
      calcium, serum phosphate or their product. Although serum parathormone levels
      were not correlated with calcification, seven of eight dialysis patients with
      hepatic artery calcification had very high parathormone levels. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      hepatic artery is far less frequently calcified than are the abdominal aorta and 
      splenic artery. This may be a teleologic phenomenon of the liver.

TI  - Cardiac calcification in adult hemodialysis patients. A link between end-stage
      renal disease and cardiovascular disease?
PG  - 695-701
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine clinical and laboratory correlates of
      calcification of the coronary arteries (CAs), aorta and mitral and aortic valves 
      in adult subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis.
      BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is known to be a risk factor for ischemic
      heart disease in non-uremic individuals. Patients with ESRD experience
      accelerated vascular calcification, due at least in part to dysregulation of
      mineral metabolism. Clinical correlates of the extent of calcification in ESRD
      have not been identified. Moreover, the clinical relevance of calcification as
      measured by electron-beam tomography (EBT) has not been determined in the ESRD
      population. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 205 maintenance
      hemodialysis patients who received baseline EBT for evaluation of vascular and
      valvular calcification. We compared subjects with and without clinical evidence
      of atherosclerotic vascular disease and determined correlates of the extent of
      vascular and valvular calcification using multivariable linear regression and
      proportional odds logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The median coronary
      artery calcium score was 595 (interquartile range, 76 to 1,600), values
      consistent with a high risk of obstructive coronary artery disease in the general
      population. The CA calcium scores were directly related to the prevalence of
      myocardial infarction (p < 0.0001) and angina (p < 0.0001), and the aortic
      calcium scores were directly related to the prevalence of claudication (p =
      0.001) and aortic aneurysm (p = 0.02). The extent of coronary calcification was
      more pronounced with older age, male gender, white race, diabetes, longer
      dialysis vintage and higher serum concentrations of calcium and phosphorus. Total
      cholesterol (and high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein
      subfractions), triglycerides, hemoglobin and albumin were not significantly
      related to the extent of CA calcification. Only dialysis vintage was
      significantly associated with the prevalence of valvular calcification.
      CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery calcification is common, severe and significantly
      associated with ischemic cardiovascular disease in adult ESRD patients. The
      dysregulation of mineral metabolism in ESRD may influence vascular calcification 
      risk.

TI  - Soluble osteopontin and vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 455-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification often occurs in patients with uremia. As
      osteopontin (OPN) is not only involved in the physiological but also the
      pathological calcification of tissues, OPN may be associated with the
      pathogenesis of aortic calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. METHODS: We
      examined the expression of OPN in atherosclerotic aortas of HD patients. In
      addition, we performed a prospective longitudinal study by using CT scans to
      detect aortic calcifications and by measuring the plasma OPN concentration by
      ELISA in HD patients (20 men, 16 women; mean age 55.2 +/- 21.3 years) and in
      healthy volunteers (18 men, 17 women; mean age 54.0 +/- 13.2 years). RESULTS: By 
      immunohistochemical staining, OPN was abundantly localized in atherosclerotic
      plaques of HD patients. The macrophages surrounding the atheromatous plaques were
      identified as the OPN-expressing cells. We furthermore found that the
      concentration of soluble plasma OPN was significantly higher in HD patients as
      compared with the concentrations in age-matched healthy volunteers (837.3 +/-
      443.2 vs. 315.1 +/- 117.4 ng/ml, p < 0.01). The OPN concentration was positively 
      correlated with the aortic calcification index in HD patients (r = 0.749, p <
      0.01). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that OPN, secreted by macrophages, plays a 
      role in the calcification of atheromatous plaques in HD patients.

TI  - Arterial changes in paediatric haemodialysis patients undergoing renal
      transplantation.
PG  - 2041-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between primary renal disease and arterial wall
      changes in paediatric haemodialysis patients has been little studied. The aim of 
      the present work was to determine the influence of primary renal disease on
      arterial wall pathology in uraemic paediatric patients. METHODS: Twelve
      paediatric haemodialysis patients (seven girls, five boys) aged 11-17 years were 
      included in the study. The primary renal diseases were urinary malformations in
      six patients (uropathy group) and acquired glomerular diseases (glomerulopathy
      group) in six patients. Age, sex distribution, duration of chronic renal failure,
      duration of haemodialysis, blood pressure, serum glucose, triglycerides,
      cholesterol, fibrinogen, calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels were 
      compared. Internal iliac artery samples were obtained at the time of
      related-donor renal transplantation. Artery samples were fixed in formaldehyde
      and sections were stained separately with haematoxylin and eosin, Orcein,
      Verhoef-van Gieson, and Masson trichrome. RESULTS: Five arteries had fibrous or
      fibroelastic intimal thickening, medial mucoid ground substance and disruption of
      the internal elastic lamella. Two of these had microcalcification in the intimal 
      layer; another two demonstrated atheromatous plaques; the remaining five were
      normal. These pathological changes were found in the arteries of all six patients
      with uropathy, whereas of the six patients with glomerulopathy only one had
      arterial changes (P<0.001). The duration of chronic renal failure was 4.8+/-1.9
      years in the uropathy group and 2.2+/-1.2 in the glomerulopathy group (P<0.05).
      The two groups were comparable in terms of serum glucose, triglycerides,
      cholesterol, fibrinogen, calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels, presence of
      hypertension, sex distribution, and duration of haemodialysis. Plasma phosphorus 
      and the calcium x phosphate product were higher in the uropathy group than in the
      glomerulopathy group (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that
      pathological changes are common in the arteries of uraemic paediatric patients,
      and that calcification and atherosclerosis are integral to this disease process. 
      In our study, these alterations were more common in the patients with uropathy.
      We speculate that the patients with uropathy are more prone to these alterations 
      due to slower progression and a longer duration of renal insufficiency.

TI  - Hemodialysis access placement with preoperative noninvasive vascular mapping:
      comparison between patients with and without diabetes.
PG  - 560-4
AB  - We retrospectively analyzed data on preoperative vascular mapping in 195
      consecutive patients to investigate the common belief that patients with diabetes
      are poor candidates to have an arteriovenous fistula placed as dialysis access
      because they lack suitable blood vessels. There was no difference in venous
      diameter, arterial diameter, and arterial peak systolic velocity measurements
      between patients with and without diabetes. Patients with diabetes had a greater 
      prevalence of vascular calcifications and greater cuff measurements of systolic
      segmental arterial pressure. In 140 of 195 patients, subsequent vascular access
      surgery had been performed in our institution, and 127 of these patients were on 
      hemodialysis therapy at the end of the study period. There was no difference in
      the prevalence of fistula placement (66% versus 60%; chi-square = 2.6; df = 2; P 
      = 0.28, not significant [NS]) and percentage of functioning fistulae between
      patients with and without diabetes (67% versus 62%; chi-square = 0.27; df = 1; P 
      = 0.61, NS). The percentage of patients dialyzed through a temporary catheter was
      equal in patients with and without diabetes (18%). In summary, patients with
      diabetes seem to be as good candidates for arteriovenous fistula placement as
      patients without diabetes. Additional studies are required to determine the
      long-term outcome of fistulae in patients with diabetes.

TI  - Early results and characteristic problems associated with cardiac surgery in
      long-term dialysis patients.
PG  - 420-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): To analyze early results and characteristic problems that develop
      after cardiac surgery on dialysis patients. METHODS: One hundred fourteen
      patients on maintenance dialysis underwent cardiac surgery. Their mean age was
      63.5 +/- 9.7 years, and 87 (76%) were male. The causes of chronic renal failure
      were diabetes mellitus in 41 (36%) and chronic glomerulonephritis in 40 (35%).
      Patients had previously been on dialysis for a mean duration of 7.8 +/- 5.6 years
      (range; 0.25-24 years). RESULTS: Fourteen (12%) were emergent cases. Eighty six
      patients (75%) received isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and 10
      patients underwent operations in which CABG was combined with other cardiac
      procedures. Twelve patients (14%) of the isolated CABG patient group (86
      patients) were restricted to non-clamping bypass procedure due to severe
      calcification of the ascending aorta. Calcification score, which was represented 
      by the sum of all involved coronary artery segments, was also significantly
      higher in dialysis patients than in the control group (4.5 +/- 2.4 segments vs.
      1.5 +/- 2.1 segments, p < 0.05). Hospital mortality was 8.8% (10/114) overall,
      and 7% (6/86) in isolated CABG patients. The causes of deaths were as follows:
      intestinal necrosis in 3, arrhythmia in 2, cerebral infarction in 1, low output
      syndrome in 1, and sepsis in 3 (mediastinitis, pneumonia, and prosthetic valve
      infection). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term dialysis is a major risk factor in cardiac
      surgery. However, because the surgical results proved to be acceptable, long-term
      dialysis patients should not be denied cardiac surgery.

TI  - Transcutaneous oxygen tension in patients with calciphylaxis.
PG  - 797-806
AB  - Calciphylaxis is a severe complication of chronic renal failure, confined almost 
      exclusively to patients on dialysis therapy. Histological characteristics of
      calciphylaxis include small-vessel calcifications of skin, subcutaneous tissue,
      and visceral organs. These vascular changes promote tissue ischemia that often
      results in tissue necrosis. In this study, we investigated the extent of skin
      ischemia in patients with calciphylaxis by means of transcutaneous oxygen tension
      (TCPO(2)) measurement, a noninvasive test that accurately assesses skin
      oxygenation. TCPO(2) levels were measured in 21 patients with calciphylaxis and
      21 age- and sex-matched patients without evidence of calciphylaxis (controls).
      TCPO(2) levels were measured bilaterally at the chest, anterior abdomen, and
      upper thigh while patients breathed room air and after a 30-minute exposure to
      100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO(2)). Compared with controls, patients with 
      calciphylaxis showed significantly lower TCPO(2) levels at each body region. In
      both controls and patients with calciphylaxis, lower TCPO(2) levels correlated
      with increased weight and use of hemodialysis. No correlation with serum
      parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium, or serum phosphorus values was present,
      although 39% of the patients with calciphylaxis had markedly elevated PTH values 
      (sixfold greater than normal; >300 pg/dL). Low TCPO(2) levels in patients with
      calciphylaxis were documented in body regions with and without skin lesions. In
      patients with calciphylaxis, extremely low TCPO(2) values (</=30 mm Hg while
      patients breathed room air) were present in 62% of the body regions with skin
      lesions and 26% of the body regions without lesions. Room-air TCPO(2) levels
      </=30 mm Hg were present in only 0.8% of the body regions of control patients.
      TCPO(2) levels obtained while patients breathed 100% FIO(2) remained lower in
      patients with calciphylaxis than in controls. In conclusion, TCPO(2) levels are
      abnormally low in patients with calciphylaxis, indicating that severe and diffuse
      skin ischemia exists, even at areas free of skin lesions. Low TCPO(2) values did 
      not substantially increase with 100% FIO(2) in many patients with calciphylaxis, 
      suggesting a fixed insufficiency of the skin vessels. This study shows that
      TCPO(2) measurements may allow rapid and noninvasive screening for skin ischemia 
      before the development of skin lesions in patients with calciphylaxis.

TI  - Coral reef aorta: a long-term study of 21 patients.
PG  - 626-33
AB  - Coral reef aorta is a rare calcifying disease of the juxtarenal and suprarenal
      aorta. We report here our surgical experience in treating 21 patients, with a
      mean follow-up of 4 years and 7 months. Both genders were equally affected. Ten
      male (48%) and 11 female (52%) patients with a mean age of 54.6 years (range
      42-76 years) underwent surgery. The main symptoms were limb claudication (n = 11,
      52%), renovascular stenosis (n = 9, 43%) with concurrent renovascular
      hypertension (n = 5, 24%), and angina abdominalis (n = 7, 33%). Most patients had
      multiorgan vascular disease such as iliofemoral arterial occlusive disease (n =
      14, 66%), coronary artery obstruction (n = 8, 38%), or obstruction of the carotid
      artery (n = 6, 28%). Risk factors did not differ between coral reef patients and 
      those with other occlusive vascular diseases. All patients were treated through
      vascular operations, including open thromboendarterectomy of the suprarenal (n = 
      9, 43%), infrarenal (n = 4, 19%), or supra- and infrarenal aorta (n = 8, 38%),
      and thromboendarterectomy of the following vessels: celiac artery (n = 7, 33%),
      superior mesenteric artery (n = 12, 57%), inferior mesenteric artery (n = 3,
      14%), unilateral renal artery (n = 3, 14%), or bilateral renal artery (n = 9,
      43%). Bypass reconstructions were performed in 39% (n = 8). A thoracoabdominal
      approach was used in 14 patients (67%) and a median laparotomy in 7 (33%). Our
      results show that coral reef aorta is not confined to either gender. It appears
      most frequently in the context of general atherosclerotic disease and patients
      benefit from timely diagnosis and operation before onset of severe,
      life-threatening visceral and renal complications.

TI  - Morphology of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in patients with end-stage renal
      failure.
PG  - 218-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: An excessive rate of cardiac death is a well-known feature of renal
      failure. Coronary heart disease is frequent and the possibility has been raised
      that the natural history of the coronary plaque is different in uraemic patients.
      We assessed the morphology of coronary arteries in patients with end-stage renal 
      failure and compared them with coronary arteries of matched non-uraemic control
      patients. METHODS: Fifty-four cases were identified at autopsy who met the
      inclusion criteria: cases, end-stage renal disease (n=27); controls, non-renal
      patients with coronary artery disease (n=27). At autopsy all three coronary
      arteries were prepared at corresponding sites for investigations: (i) qualitative
      analysis (after Stary), (ii) quantitative measurements of intima and media
      thickness (by planimetry), (iii) immunohistochemical analysis of the coronary
      plaques and (iv) X-ray diffraction of selected calcified plaques. RESULTS:
      Qualitative analysis of the coronary arteries showed significantly more calcified
      plaques of coronary arteries in patients with end-stage renal failure. Plaques of
      non-uraemic patients were mostly fibroatheromatous. Media thickness of coronary
      arteries was significantly higher in uraemic patients (187+/-53 microm vs
      135+/-29 microm in controls) and intima thickness tended to be higher (158+/-38
      microm vs 142+/-31 microm) but this difference was not statistically significant.
      Plaque area (4.09+/-1. 50 mm(2) vs 4.39+/-0.88 mm(2)) was comparable in both
      groups. Lumen area, however, was significantly lower in end-stage renal patients.
      Immunohistochemical analysis of the cellular infiltrate in coronary arteries
      showed no major differences in these advanced plaques of uraemic and non-uraemic 
      subjects. CONCLUSION: Coronary plaques in patients with end-stage renal failure
      are characterized by increased media thickness and marked calcification. In
      contrast to the previous opinion the most marked difference compared to
      non-uraemic controls does not concern the size, but the composition of the
      plaque. Deposition of calcium within the plaques may contribute to the high
      complication rate in uraemic patients.

TI  - Hypoparathyroidism potentiates cardiovascular complications through disturbed
      calcium metabolism: possible risk of vitamin D(3) analog administration in
      dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Progressive cardiovascular calcification in dialysis patients
      with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a serious complication; however, the
      precise mechanism remains uncertain. We tested whether metabolic calcium
      abnormalities and hypoparathyroidism might have a correlation with cardiovascular
      complications in ESRD patients. METHODS: A series of 48 ESRD patients with
      cardiovascular diseases and/or congestive heart failure, aged 36-82 (61 +/- 12)
      years, 23 male and 25 female, were enrolled in this study. Serum total calcium
      (Ca, mmol/l), inorganic phosphate (mmol/l), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH,
      pg/ml) levels were determined in all cases. RESULTS: Organic heart disease was
      confirmed in 28 patients (58.3%), including 15 with coronary artery disease: 8
      with aortic aneurysm, 8 with stenotic valvular heart disease, 9 with excessive
      mitral annular calcification, 3 with dialysis cardiomyopathy, and 7 with
      obstructive arterial disease. Serum iPTH measurement revealed hypoparathyroidism 
      (iPTH <60) in 20 of 48 (41.7%) and hyperthyroidism (iPTH >/=200) in 13 of 48
      (27.1%) subjects. The 20 patients with low iPTH had a higher prevalence of
      valvular heart disease, a higher total Ca level corrected for serum albumin (2.70
      +/- 0.30 in low iPTH vs. 2.47 +/- 0.30 in normal iPTH, 2.35 +/- 0.20 in high
      iPTH, p = 0.003) and a higher tendency of vitamin D(3) analog use (65% in low
      iPTH vs. 33% in normal iPTH and 46% in high iPTH, p = 0.078). Moreover, corrected
      serum Ca exhibited a negative logarithmic correlation with serum iPTH: corrected 
      Ca = -0.284x log (iPTH) + 3.021 (r = 0.637, p = 0.0001). Multiple logistic
      regression analysis revealed diabetes and hypoparathyroidism (iPTH <60) as risk
      factors for cardiovascular complications in ESRD. CONCLUSION: These results
      suggest that hypercalcemia and hypoparathyroidism in conjunction with vitamin
      D(3) use might play an important role in cardiovascular complications of chronic 
      dialysis patients.

TI  - [Prognosis for patients with angina pectoris accompanied by chronic renal
      failure].
PG  - 9-18
AB  - Chronic renal failure (CRF) is one of the risk factors of a worse outcome for
      patients with coronary artery disease. However, few studies have assessed the
      outcome in such patients. This study investigated the clinical characteristics,
      treatment modalities, and prognosis for patients with angina pectoris accompanied
      by CRF and evaluated the validity of current treatment strategy for these
      patients. A total of 593 patients (248 with stable angina and 345 with unstable
      angina) admitted to our institution were studied. Renal failure was defined as
      serum creatinine of > or = 2.0 mg/dl. Patients were divided into 2 groups, with
      renal failure (46 patients) and without renal failure (547 patients), and the
      former group was further divided into 2 groups with hemodialysis (26 patients)
      and without hemodialysis (20 patients). The mean follow-up period was 2.5 +/- 1.2
      years and the follow-up rate was 99%. The prevalences of congestive heart failure
      (26% vs 3%, p < 0.001), hypertension (72% vs 45%, p < 0.005), and multivessel
      coronary artery disease (65% vs 33%, p < 0.001) were higher in patients with CRF.
      The left ventricular end-diastolic volume was greater in patients with CRF than
      in patients without CRF (114 +/- 36 vs 85 +/- 24 ml/m2, p < 0.001). The
      calcification score of both coronary arteries and abdominal aorta evaluated by
      electron-beam computed tomography was higher in patients with CRF (2,187 +/-
      2,727 vs 631 +/- 841, p = 0.03; 4,091 +/- 3,068 vs 2,191 +/- 2,249, p = 0.02,
      respectively). In-hospital cardiac mortality was higher in patients with CRF than
      in patients without CRF (8.7% vs 0.7%, p < 0.001). The cumulative survival was
      88% at 1 year and 65% at 3 years in patients with CRF and 99% and 97% in patients
      without CRF, respectively (p < 0.001). The incidence of re-hospitalization due to
      congestive heart failure was higher in patients with CRF (19% vs 1.3%, p <
      0.0001). The cumulative survival in CRF was 93% at 1 year, 57% at 3 years in the 
      medical treatment group and 87% and 75% in the invasive therapy group,
      respectively (p = 0.1). Patients with angina pectoris and CRF had a poor
      prognosis under the current treatment strategy. Newly developed therapeutic
      strategies, such as rotational atherectomy, minimally invasive direct coronary
      artery bypass surgery and combinations, will be necessary to improve the
      long-term prognosis for these patients.

TI  - Factors associated with calcification of the abdominal aorta in hemodialysis
      patients.
PG  - S238-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular injury caused by arteriosclerosis 
      has been the major cause of the death in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We
      quantitatively analyzed and evaluated the severity of abdominal aortic
      calcification in HD patients in comparison to risk factors for arteriosclerosis. 
      METHODS: One hundred thirty-seven HD patients were examined. Using image analysis
      software, areas of the calcified abdominal aorta were quantitatively analyzed on 
      plain computerized tomography images. Other factors such as blood pressure (BP), 
      lipid levels, and calcium (Ca) x phosphorus (Pi) value were also analyzed.
      RESULTS: Patients with a higher one-year average of systolic BP showed a higher
      severity of abdominal aortic calcification. That is, the severity of abdominal
      aortic calcification in patients with a one-year systolic BP average above 160 mm
      Hg was 31.5 +/- 13.6%, and this severity was significantly higher than that in
      patients with a one-year systolic BP average of less than 120 mm Hg (8.0 +/-
      7.7%, P < 0.01). The severity of abdominal aortic calcification in patients
      demonstrating risk values of ectopic calcification, that is serum Ca x Pi > or = 
      60 (mg/dl), on more than 4 of 24 measurements within one year (25.8 +/- 13.6%)
      was significantly higher than the severity of aortic calcification in patients
      demonstrating this value less than four times in one year (P < 0.05). There was
      no correlation between levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, lipoprotein(a), and severity 
      of abdominal aortic calcification. CONCLUSIONS: Systolic BP levels and the
      product of serum Ca and Pi were related to the severity of abdominal aortic
      calcification in HD patients. These observations suggested that BP control, as
      well as control of serum Ca and Pi levels, was important in preventing the
      progression of abdominal aortic arteriosclerosis.

TI  - Coronary artery diameter and left ventricular function in patients on maintenance
      hemodialysis treatment: comparison between diabetic and nondiabetic patients.
PG  - 269-73
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study examined the role of diabetes mellitus on determining
      left ventricular function by evaluating coronary artery diameter in patients with
      end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis treatment. METHODS: We
      studied 12 diabetic and 12 nondiabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis
      treatment without significant stenoses of the major epicardial coronary arteries.
      Patients were matched for age, sex distribution, duration of dialysis and
      incidence of major coronary risk factors. Left ventricular wall thickness (septal
      and posterior walls) and left ventricular diameter (end-diastolic and systolic
      phases), were measured by echocardiography. Hemodynamic measurements and coronary
      angiography were performed on the day of hemodialysis and coronary artery
      diameter at the proximal and mid portion of three major coronary arteries were
      measured using the computed densitometry method. RESULTS: Right and left anterior
      descending and circumflex coronary artery diameters were all significantly
      smaller and the frequency of coronary artery calcification was higher in diabetic
      (58%) compared to nondiabetic (8%) patients. Although there were no significant
      differences in left ventricular wall thickness, left ventricular diameter, mean
      right atrial pressure and cardiac index between the two groups, left ventricular 
      end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in diabetic (22 +/- 9 mm Hg)
      compared to nondiabetic patients (14 +/- 5 mm Hg). CONCLUSION: Despite that there
      were no significant stenoses of the major epicardial coronary arteries, diffuse
      luminal narrowing of the epicardial coronary arteries in diabetic patients on
      maintenance hemodialysis treatment was associated with increased left ventricular
      end-diastolic pressure.

TI  - Cardiac valve calcification in haemodialysis patients: role of calcium-phosphate 
      metabolism.
PG  - 2037-40
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has been detected with increased
      frequency in haemodialysis (HD) patients, making it necessary to determine the
      potential pathogenic factors in uraemic patients. METHODS: A total of 92 chronic 
      HD patients (39 female, 53 male) and 92 age and gender-matched nondialysis
      control subjects were evaluated by echocardiography and a severity score for VC
      was determined. Calcium phosphate metabolism was evaluated at the beginning of
      haemodialysis. RESULTS: We found a greater prevalence of VC in dialysis patients 
      than in normal patients (mitral annulus 44.5% vs 10%, P = 0.02; aortic annulus
      52% vs 4.3%, P = 0.01). HD patients with mitral calcification were found to be
      older than patients without calcification, were on long-term renal replacement
      therapy, had longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension, had greater
      values of the highest value of mean calcium phosphate product in 6 successive
      months (CaxP) and the highest absolute value of calcium-phosphate product
      (CaxPmax). We also found a positive correlation between calcification score, age,
      and CaxP. No correlation was found between actual VC and arterial hypertension or
      parathyroid hormone. Multiple stepwise regression analysis selected age and CaxP 
      as the most predictive parameters for mitral calcification (r = 0.47). Mitral
      calcification was associated more frequently with rhythm and cardiac conduction
      defects, valvular insufficiency and with peripheral vascular calcification.
      Aortic calcification was correlated with age (r = 0.42) and longer duration of
      predialysis arterial hypertension. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed an increased
      prevalence of VC in HD patients and selected age and calcium phosphate product as
      the most predictive parameters. These findings support careful monitoring of
      calcium metabolism beginning at the early stages of end-stage renal failure to
      reduce the risk of heart disease.

TI  - Calcified plaque is common in the carotid and femoral arteries of dialysis
      patients without clinical vascular disease.
PG  - 2004-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac and vascular mortality are common in end-stage renal disease 
      (ERSD) and are often attributed to accelerated atherosclerosis. SUBJECTS AND
      METHODS: We studied 24 non-diabetic ESRD patients without cardiac or vascular
      disease (M = 12, F = 12) and 24 age-, sex- and race-matched healthy controls. All
      underwent B-mode ultrasound for carotid and femoral intima media thickness (IMT) 
      and plaque (% stenosis) together with blood pressure (BP), and echocardiograms to
      determine left ventricular mass. RESULTS: Both BP and mean IMT were similar in
      patients and controls. However, discrete plaque was present in 71% (17/24) of
      patients compared with 21% (5/24) of controls (P = 0.001), and % stenosis was
      greater in patients (carotid 12.2 +/- 11% vs 2.3 +/- 5.9%, P < 0.0004; femoral
      16.4 +/- 19.1% vs 3.1 +/- 6.4%, P < 0.003). Plaque was soft/atheromatous in 3 of 
      the 5 controls, but not in any of the 17 patients (P = 0.007), all of whom had
      calcified lesions. BP and cholesterol were not correlated with IMT or plaque in
      patients, but in control subjects carotid IMT was correlated with systolic BP (r 
      = 0.66, P < 0.0005) and diastolic BP (r = 0.45, P < 0.03). In patients, the only 
      independent variables related to vascular morphology were serum albumin which was
      inversely related to IMT (P < 0.03) and to plaque (carotid P < 0.05, femoral P < 
      0.02) and age, which was related to femoral plaque only (P < 0.04). Left
      ventricular end-diastolic internal dimension, not LVMI, correlated positively
      with carotid IMT (P < 0.04). CONCLUSION: Our results show that calcified plaque
      is common in ESRD patients and hypoalbuminaemia may be an associated factor.

TI  - Influence of biochemical alterations on arterial stiffness in patients with
      end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 535-41
AB  - The incremental elastic modulus of the common carotid and radial arteries is
      increased in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), independently of blood
      pressure, wall stress, and the presence of atherosclerotic alterations. Whether
      biochemical factors may be involved in the arterial changes and related to renal 
      dysfunction remain largely ignored. To assess this question, we measured aortic
      (carotid-femoral), upper-limb (carotid-radial), and lower-limb (femoral-tibial)
      pulse wave velocity (PWV) in 74 ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis in
      comparison with 57 control subjects similar in age, sex ratio, and mean blood
      pressure. We evaluated arterial blood pressure by sphygmomanometry, aortic
      calcifications and cardiac mass by echography, and routine biochemical
      parameters, total plasma homocysteine, and plasma endothelin levels by standard
      techniques. In the population of patients with ESRD, on the basis of multiple
      stepwise regression analysis, aortic PWV was positively and independently
      correlated with systolic blood pressure (P<.0001), age (P<.0001), prevalence of
      aortic calcification (P=.0004), and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus
      (P=.0043). Upper-limb PWV was influenced exclusively by mean blood pressure
      (P<.0001). Lower-limb PWV was positively and independently correlated with plasma
      total homocysteine (P=.0004) and plasma endothelin (P=.0187) only. At any
      vascular site, PWV was not independently correlated with tobacco consumption;
      plasma levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, fibrinogen, or hemoglobin; body mass 
      index; or the presence of bilateral nephrectomy. Finally, plasma homocysteine was
      independently correlated with cardiac mass (P=.0022). This study provides
      evidence that in ESRD patients, the stiffness of the arterial wall and cardiac
      mass are strongly influenced by biochemical factors related to the kidney
      alterations and are independent of age and blood pressure level. Increased plasma
      endothelin and homocysteine may be specifically involved in the vascular damage
      of lower limbs.

TI  - A study on the biological significance of midregion and intact parathyroid
      hormone in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 289-97
AB  - In this study, we investigated the relationship between the concentrations of
      intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH) and midregion PTH (m-PTH) measured by an
      immunoradiometric assay and a radioimmunoassay, respectively, versus various
      demographic and biochemical parameters, bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar 
      spine (LS) and radius, and the radiographic findings of osteosclerosis and aortic
      calcification in hemodialysis (HD) patients. m-PTH correlated positively and more
      significantly with serum calcium (Ca), serum phosphorus (P), Ca-P solubility
      products (Ca x P) and LS-BMD than i-PTH did (P = 0.024 vs. 0.531, 0.001 vs.
      0.061, 0.0001 vs. 0.125, and 0.017 vs. 0.284, respectively). A positive
      correlation between the percent changes in serum P over the 1-month measurement
      period and those in m-PTH rather than in i-PTH was also observed (P = 0.021 vs.
      0.869). These data indicate than m-PTH is distinct from i-PTH in its positive
      correlation with serum Ca, serum P, Ca [symbol: see text] P and LS-BMD in HD
      patients. Since m-PTH is known to consist mostly of the midregion and
      carboxyl-terminal fragments of PTH in HD patients, the present study suggests
      that these PTH fragments may be biologically significant in the patients in vivo.

TI  - Infrapopliteal bypasses to severely calcified, unclampable outflow arteries:
      two-year results.
PG  - 6-15; discussion 15-6
AB  - PURPOSE: Although severe, circumferential calcification of distal outflow vessels
      is frequently encountered, its effect on bypass graft patency rates has not been 
      well established. METHODS: Using a computerized vascular registry database, we
      conducted a retrospective review of 1957 bypass grafts with distal anastomoses to
      infrapopliteal vessels performed at a single institution between 1990 and 1995.
      Of these cases, 101 procedures involved outflow arteries classified by the
      operating surgeon as severely calcified and unclampable (requiring intraluminal
      occluders for vascular control), whereas in 105 cases the outflow arteries had no
      calcification present at the distal anastomotic site. The remaining cases had
      varying intermediate degrees of calcification and were not analyzed. Indication
      for bypass procedure was limb-threatening ischemia in 90% of severe calcification
      cases and in 84% of cases without calcification. Atherosclerotic risk factors
      were similar except for the presence of diabetes (92% vs 74%, p < 0.001),
      creatinine level > 2.0 mg/dl (21% vs 8%, p < 0.01), and dialysis dependency (17% 
      vs 3%, p < 0.001), all of which were more prevalent in the severe calcification
      group. Infrapopliteal distal anastomotic location and type of conduit ( > 90%
      autogenous vein) were comparable between groups. RESULTS: Primary patency,
      secondary patency, and foot salvage rates at 24 months were 60%, 65%, and 77% for
      the severe calcification group and 74%, 82%, and 93% for the no calcification
      group, respectively. With secondary procedures comprising 26% of cases in each
      group, data from the 150 primary procedures were reanalyzed separately. In this
      primary procedure group, 24-month primary patency, secondary patency, and foot
      salvage rates were 66%, 69%, and 77% for the severe calcification group and 84%, 
      90%, and 96% for the no calcification group, respectively. Although patency and
      salvage rates were consistently lower for the severe calcification group in all
      analyses, these differences did not achieve significance by log-rank life-table
      analysis at 2-year follow-up. Perioperative 30-day mortality (0.99% severe
      calcification vs 0.95% no calcification) and 24-month survival rates (84% severe 
      calcification vs 83% no calcification) were also similar between groups.
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest that effective techniques exist to perform
      infrapopliteal bypasses to severely calcified, unclampable outflow arteries with 
      results comparable with those obtained with clampable, uncalcified vessels. The
      finding of severe, circumferential calcification of outflow target arteries
      should not dissuade vascular surgeons from distal bypass for limb salvage
      indications.

TI  - Frequency of mitral annular calcification in patients on hemodialysis estimated
      by 2-dimensional echocardiography.
PG  - 179-83
AB  - Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a degenerative process associated with left
      ventricular hypertrophy (HLV) and progressive atherosclerosis, characteristic of 
      the older age groups. Numerous investigations point to significantly earlier
      onset of atherosclerosis process in patients in final stage of chronic renal
      insufficiency. The aim of investigation was to determinate the MAC frequency in
      patients on hemodialysis and to try to find the correlation between MAC intensity
      and the duration of hemodialysis, age, sex, Ca/P, metabolism, level of
      parathormone and atherogenic factors. A group of 40 patients on hemodialysis
      (aged 20 to 67, 26 men and 24 women) were divided int two groups; group 1 without
      MAC, N = 17 (42.5%), X = 3.5, SD = 3.1; and group 2 with MAC, N = 23 (57.5%), X =
      6.2, SD = 2.4. M-mode and 2-D echocardiography were performed in all patients.
      Group 2 was divided into three subgroups according to MAC quantitation: mild N = 
      16 (70%), severe, N = 4 (17%), moderate, N = 3 (13%). Study results showed
      positive correlation between MAC and serum values of Ca and P (p < 0.05).
      Increased values of HDL cholesterol, statistically significant at the level p <
      0.05 were observed. Study results showed the correlation between MAC and time
      factor, i.e. duration of dialysis treatment to be statistically significant (p < 
      0.05). Cardiac calcified syndrome could be a sequela of MAC causing conduction
      disturbances, valvular stenosis or insufficiency, and arterial emboli or
      endocarditis.

TI  - Mitral valve calcification as an index of left ventricular dysfunction in
      patients with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 383-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether mitral valve or anulus calcification (MC) in
      patients with end-stage renal disease is associated with abnormalities of left
      ventricular (LV) structure and function, cardiac characteristics of 55 patients
      undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with (n = 26; age: 59
      +/- 10 years) vs without (n = 29; age: 58 +/- 12 years) MC were analyzed using
      echocardiography and Doppler echocardiography. Sclerosis of the mitral valve
      anulus was detected in 18 (7 women, 11 men; age: 58 +/- 10 years) patients,
      sclerosis of mitral valve leaflets in 24 (13 women, 9 men; age: 59 +/- 10 years) 
      patients. Patients with MC had higher systolic arterial blood pressure before
      initiation of dialysis therapy (191/104 mm Hg vs 173/94 mm Hg; p < 0.05) and
      higher calcium-phosphorus products (55 +/- 13 vs 42 +/- 16; p < 0.05) during CAPD
      therapy than those without MC. Neither prevalence nor severity of MC was related 
      to dialysis duration or patient age. Systolic LV function was reduced (ejection
      fraction: 58 +/- 12 percent vs 65 +/- 13 percent; p < 0.05) and LV end-diastolic 
      diameters were dilated (54 +/- 5 vs 50 +/- 8 mm; p < 0.05) in patients with MC.
      Left atrial dilatation (73 percent vs 31 percent; p < 0.005) and mitral valve
      regurgitation (65 percent vs 21 percent; p < 0.001) were more frequent in
      patients with vs those without MC. Excluding patients with significant mitral
      regurgitation from pulsed Doppler analysis, diastolic LV function was comparably 
      impaired in patients with vs those without MC (maximal early/atrial filling
      velocity ratio: 0.77 +/- 0.25 vs 0.75 +/- 0.22; atrial filling fraction: 47 +/-
      10 percent vs 48 +/- 11 percent; p = NS). The presented data suggest that MC
      follows long-standing and severe arterial hypertension before start of dialysis
      therapy. Therefore, effective blood pressure control in the predialysis period
      may be a tool to prevent these lesions. MC has clinical significance as a marker 
      of LV dilatation and reduced LV systolic function in patients with chronic CAPD.

TI  - Histological, radiological, and biochemical features of the adynamic bone lesion 
      in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
PG  - 19-29
AB  - Adynamic bone is being found with increasing frequency in dialysis patients.
      Little is known about its aetiology, and even less about its natural history. We 
      found 10 cases of asymptomatic adynamic bone among a group of 32 continuous
      ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients, most of whom had never been exposed to
      aluminium-containing phosphate binders. Compared to the remaining 22 patients,
      they had an older mean age (54 +/- 11.4 vs. 42 +/- 11.8 years; p < 0.05),
      probably a longer pre-dialysis duration of renal failure (10.9 vs. 7.1 years),
      higher mean ionized calcium (1.30 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.02 mmol/l; p < 0.01),
      and lower mean intact parathyroid hormone (31.5 vs. 200.3 pg/ml; p < 0.001). The 
      bone density was not different between the two groups, but 9 of the 10 adynamic
      patients had significant vascular calcification seen on plain radiology as
      compared with only 7 of 20 in the comparison group (p < 0.05). Follow-up of the
      adynamic patients showed a close association with serum intact parathyroid
      hormone and ionized calcium levels. With one exception, adynamic bone did not
      appear to be associated with lower bone density than other types of
      osteodystrophy, but a longer-term study is required to determine the complete
      natural history of this lesion.

TI  - [Evaluation of arterial compliance in renal insufficiency].
PG  - 63-6
AB  - The pulse wave velocity (PWV) of the aorta, of the arm, of the leg, was measured 
      in 90 normal subjects (N) and 92 dialysis patients (D) of the same age and blood 
      pressure status. All patients underwent blood biochemistry, especially serum
      liquid concentrations, and aortic ultra-sonography. Aortic calcifications were
      diagnosed by echo and radiologic examination. Aortic PWV was significantly higher
      in D (1,113 +/- 319 cm/s) than in N (965 +/- 216 cm/s) (p = 0.0016). The aortic
      diameters were greater in D both at the aortic root and at the bifurcation. The
      pulse pressure was higher in D (76.6 +/- 23.7 vs 63.9 +/- 2 mmHg, p = 0.007). In 
      both populations, the PWV increased with age and blood pressure but aortic
      calcification was only weakly correlated with this increase. These results
      indicate that the compliance of the aortic wall is reduced in D and leads to an
      increase in the pulsatile component of the blood pressure and thereby to an
      increase in left ventricular afterload.

TI  - Soft tissue calcification in pediatric patients with end-stage renal disease.
PG  - 931-6
AB  - Soft tissue calcification is a recognized complication of uremia in adult
      patients and has been implicated as a cause of ischemic necrosis, cardiac
      arrhythmias, and respiratory failure. However, soft tissue calcification has been
      regarded as rare in pediatric renal patients. Following a sudden death due to
      pulmonary calcinosis in an adolescent after renal transplantation, we
      retrospectively reviewed clinical, biochemical and autopsy data of 120 patients
      with uremia, on dialysis, or following renal transplantation cared for at
      Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles from 1960 to 1983. Soft tissue calcification
      was found in 72 of 120 patients (60 percent). Forty-three patients (36 percent)
      had systemic calcinosis (Group A): the most frequent sites of mineral deposition 
      were blood vessels, lung, kidney, myocardium, coronary artery, central nervous
      system, and gastric mucosa. Vascular calcification was uniformly accompanied by
      deposits in other organs. Twenty-nine patients had small amounts of focal
      calcification (Group B) and 48 patients had no soft tissue calcification (Group
      C). By multiple logistic regression analysis, the use of vitamin D or its
      analogues, the form of vitamin D medication prescribed, the peak calcium x
      phosphorus product, the age at onset of renal failure, and male sex were jointly 
      associated with calcinosis (Group A). Vitamin D therapy showed the strongest
      independent association with calcinosis and the probability of calcinosis was
      greater in patients receiving calcitriol when compared with dihydrotachysterol
      and vitamin D2 or D3. The duration of renal failure, peak serum calcium, serum
      calcium at death, serum phosphorus at death, and primary renal diagnosis, were
      not statistically associated with calcinosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Aortic and large artery compliance in end-stage renal failure.
PG  - 137-42
AB  - Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured in the aorta, right leg and arm of 90
      control subjects (CS) and 92 hemodialysis patients (HD) of the same age and mean 
      arterial pressure (MAP). Blood chemistry, including blood lipids, and echographic
      dimensions of the aorta, were measured in all subjects. Presence of aortic
      calcification was evaluated by abdominal X-ray and echography. Whereas femoral
      and brachial PWV were only slightly increased in HD (P less than 0.05), the
      aortic PWV was significantly elevated (1113 +/- 319 cm/sec) in comparison with CS
      (965 +/- 216 cm/sec; P = 0.0016). Aortic diameters were larger in HD, both at the
      root of aorta (32.7 +/- 4 vs. 28.2 +/- 2.8 mm; P less than 0.0001) and aortic
      bifurcation (16.9 +/- 3.1 vs. 14.6 +/- 2.2 mm; P less than 0.0001). Although the 
      MAP was similar in HD (109.9 +/- 19.3 mm Hg) and CS (110.2 +/- 17.2 mm Hg), the
      pulse pressure was significantly increased in HD patients (76.6 +/- 23.7 vs. 63.9
      +/- 22 mm Hg; P = 0.007). In the two populations, aortic PWV was found to
      increase with age (P less than 0.0001) and MAP (P less than 0.0001). The presence
      of aortic calcification showed only a borderline relationship with the increase
      in aortic PWV (P = 0.050 in CS and P = 0.069 in HD). As change in PWV is directly
      related to change in distensibility, and the aortic diameters were increased in
      HD, these results indicate that aortic wall compliance is decreased in HD,
      resulting in an increase in the pulsatile component of arterial
      pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Hereditary polycystic kidney disease associated with osteorenal syndrome in rats.
PG  - 195-201
AB  - Hereditary polycystic kidney disease (PKD) was seen in Han:SPRD rats and
      identified as an autosomal, incomplete dominant trait. Homozygous animals died at
      3 to 4 weeks of age, while heterozygous males were severely ill or moribund
      within about 6 months. Heterozygous females developed PKD to a lesser extent than
      males and survived longer. Renal secondary hyperparathyroidism and
      osteodystrophia fibrosa were seen in most males but were absent in females. In
      male rats metastatic calcification was found in kidneys, lungs, glandular and
      forestomach, blood vessels, and heart. In a few uremic males ulcerative enteritis
      occurred in cecum and colon. Blood urea nitrogen values were significantly
      increased in both sexes.

TI  - Prevention of osteitis fibrosa, aluminium bone disease and soft-tissue
      calcification in dialysis patients: a long-term comparison of moderate doses of
      oral calcium +/- Mg(OH)2 vs Al(OH)3 +/- 1 alpha OH vitamin D3.
PG  - 1045-53
AB  - Since 1980, moderately large doses of oral calcium (80 +/- 35 mmol/day as CaCO3
      +/- calcium polystyrene sulphonate), in association if necessary with Mg(OH)2
      (2.5 +/- 1 g/day), with a reduction in the dialysate Mg concentrations from 0.75 
      to 0.375 mmol/24 h, have replaced A1(OH)3 as phosphate binders in our centre.
      A1(OH)3 was previously given to our haemodialysis patients in association with
      small doses of Ca CO3 (less than or equal to 3 g/day) and if necessary with 1
      alpha OH vitamin D3. To compare the long-term efficacy of this new approach with 
      the former one in the prevention of renal osteodystrophy and soft-tissue
      calcification, 32 current patients were selected on the basis of at least 24
      months of treatment in our centre and availability of a yearly bone survey
      (profile of lumbar spine and anteroposterior view of the pelvis, shoulders and
      hands). A group of 30 patients treated before 1980 were then selected on the same
      criteria and matched for age, sex, and duration on dialysis. Linear
      calcifications of the anterior and posterior walls of the aorta in front of L2,
      L3, L4 and on the lateral walls of the iliac and femoral arteries were measured
      and the para-articular calcifications and subperiosteal resorptions of the hands 
      evaluated. The initial extent and the subsequent increase of the ocular and
      para-articular calcification were comparable in the two groups. Plasma alkaline
      phosphatase was stable in the normal range in both groups, as was plasma
      concentration of calcium. Plasma phosphate was slightly elevated (1.7 mmol/l) but
      stable and comparable in the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Evaluation of vascular calcinosis risk factors in patients on chronic
      hemodialysis: lack of influence of calcium carbonate.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - UNLABELLED: Linear calcifications of the abdominal aorta and of the iliac and
      femoral arteries were measured yearly for 3 years on X rays of 24 patients on
      chronic hemodialysis taking variable amounts of calcium carbonate and Al(OH)3 but
      no pharmacological doses of vitamin D or 1 alpha-hydroxylated vitamin D
      derivatives. The speed of their extension appeared exponential and covariant with
      the male sex, age only for men and, independently of these two factors, with
      diastolic blood pressure and blood triglycerides. Plasma concentrations of
      calcium, phosphate and glucose were covariant with the extension of calcinosis
      only at a borderline level. The doses of calcium carbonate and the levels of
      plasma alkaline phosphatase were not at all covariant. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The
      effect of high doses of calcium carbonate is possibly harmful only when
      supraphysiological levels of plasma calcium are induced, whereas plasma phosphate
      is not adequately decreased. The doses of calcium carbonate per se have no
      deleterious effect (2). Since alkaline phosphatase is not covariant with the
      extension of calcinosis, the degree of hyperparathyroidism per se does not seem
      to play a causative role in vascular calcinosis (3). The main risk factors of
      vascular calcinosis are: age, the male sex, diastolic blood pressure and blood
      triglycerides.

AB  - The length of calcifications on the aorta and on the iliac and femoral arteries
      have been measured in hemodialyzed patients who did not take Vit D derivates but 
      variable amount of calcium carbonate just before beginning hemodialysis then once
      a year for 3 years. The extension of these calcifications was exponential. The
      most important factors of arterial calcification extension are the male sex, the 
      age only in the male sex, diastolic blood pressure, triglyceridemia, glycemia and
      calcemia. The treatment by calcium carbonate is however not by itself responsible
      of arterial calcification since no correlation was found between calcification
      extension and the doses of CaCO3.

AB  - In 42 uraemic patients radiological skeletal survey, biochemistry and bone
      histology were compared before and at 6-12 months (42 patients), 12-24 months (26
      patients) or 24-48 months (12 patients) after parathyroidectomy. The presence of 
      small vessel or non-visceral soft tissue calcification was not related to the
      age, sex, duration of end-stage renal failure treatment, total serum calcium,
      magnesium, phosphate, Ca x P product, alkaline phosphatase, ionised calcium,
      serum aluminium, iPTH, severity of radiological and histological osteitis fibrosa
      or parathyroid gland weight. Twenty-three patients (55%) had small vessel and 20 
      (48%) soft tissue calcification before parathyroidectomy. Despite a marked
      improvement in subperiosteal erosions (37 healed, 5 improved) and healing of
      osteitis fibrosa histologically, seven patients developed new and six developed
      increased peripheral arterial calcification while in 10 patients non-visceral
      soft tissue calcification disappeared and in two decreased. Successful
      parathyroidectomy improves non-visceral calcification but not arterial
      calcification despite reduction in Ca x P product and iPTH.

TI  - Effects of age, sex, and polycystic disease on progressive bone disease of renal 
      failure.
PG  - 557-60
AB  - A study of 150 patients undergoing haemodialysis has shown that age had a
      striking effect on the radiological presentation of renal bone disease, erosions 
      being common in the young and uncommon in older patients and vascular
      calcification showing opposite trends to this. Men aged 20 to 59 years had a
      greater tendency to develop erosions than did women in this age range.
      Examination of a group of 53 patients over a period of five years showed that the
      half time for the development of vascular calcification was 4.6 years, erosions
      26.7 years, and fractures 6.9 years. Nine out of 16 polycystic patients matched
      for age and sex with 50 controls did not develop erosions and had consistently
      less vascular calcification than the controls when examined over a six-year
      period.

TI  - Course of transplanted cadaver donor kidneys with previously existing pathology.
PG  - 543-71
AB  - Seventeen cases were studied in which the contralateral donor kidney was
      available for comparison with the transplanted kidney after it was removed from
      the host following varying periods of survival. The following morphologic
      observations were made: Arteries exhibiting arteriosclerosis appeared, in the new
      host, to take on a distinct new cellular deposit which was superimposed on the
      previously existing hyalinization in the intima. Except for one instance in which
      the host had secondary hyperparathyroidism, calcification in the donor organ did 
      not undergo significant change. In some instances, the lymphocytes which existed 
      in the donor kidney prior to transplantation appeared to undergo proliferation
      and produce a localized graft-versus-host reaction in the recipient.
