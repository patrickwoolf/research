N2  - Background and Aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequently associated with anemia, partially due to the insufficient production of erythropoietin. Currently this condition is treated with recombinant human erythropoietin, however in advanced CKD its application increase the risk of cardiovascular events. This initiated search for new treatment options including drugs that target the hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1) pathway. One candidate is Daprodustat, a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor which is currently tested in a Phase3 clinical trial for safety and efficacy to treat anemia in CKD patients. Recent studies revealed that hypoxia contributes to vascular calcification via the activation of HIF1 pathway, therefore we addressed the potential pro-calcifying effect of Daprodustat on vascular smooth muscle cells. Methods: We induced calcification of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) with inorganic phosphate (Pi, 1.5-2.5 mmol/L) in the presence or absence of Daprodustat (10-1000 nmol/L). Protein expressions of HIF-1α, Glut-1, ALP and VEGF were evaluated by Western blot and ELISA. Extracellular matrix mineralization was assessed by Alizarin red staining and Ca measurement. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure mRNA expressions of osteoblast-specific markers Runx2, Sox9 and ALP. Results: Daprodustat increased HIF-1α, VEGF and Glut-1 protein expressions in a dose-dependent manner. Daprodustat induced mRNA expressions of osteochondrogenic markers Runx2, Sox9 and ALP, and potentiated the effect of Pi on extracellular matrix calcification in HAoSMCs. [Formula presented] Conclusions: We concluded that Daprodustat increase Pi-mediated osteochondrogenic transdifferentiation and extracellular matrix mineralization of HAoSMCs, Further studies are warranted to address whether Daprodustat increases the risk of vascular calcification in CKD patients.

N2  - Background and Aims: Early cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major unmet need. Angiogenic T-cells (Tang) are emerging mediators of vascular homeostasis and have been linked to CVD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of circulating Tang in CKD and their potential value as biomarkers. Methods: Tang were quantified by flow cytometry in blood samples from 30 patients CKD-5D undergoing peritoneal dialysis and 16 matched healthy controls (HC). Vascular calcification was measured by Kauppila scores, left carotid IMT was quantified by ultrasound and carotid adventitial vasa vasorum (aVV) were quantified by Superb Microvascular Image. PWV was measured using the Complior Analyzer. The SCORE chart was used to quantify the traditional 10-year risk. Results: Tang frequency was decreased in CKD compared to HC (1.68(1.05) vs 3.33(1.44)%, p<0.001). Tang were not associated with blood pressure, cholesterol levels or time on dialysis (all p>0.050). CKD patients exhibited higher Kauppila scores (p<0.001), left cIMT (p=0.010) and aVV (p=0.008) than HC. Although Tang did not correlate with Kauppila (r=-0.350, p=0.080) or cIMT (r=-0.154, p=0.600) in CKD-5D, a strong association was observed with PWV (r=-0.734, p<0.001). Moreover, Tang levels were negatively associated with aVV density (newly formed aVV: r=-0.640, p=0.006; or density: r=-0.813, p<0.001). Tang levels paralleled PWV (B[95% CI]: -0.083[-0.155, -0.010], p=0.028; R2=0.531) and aVV: -15.049[-26.705, -3.392], p=0.015; R2=0.598) and improved the model over the SCORE alone (R2=0.360 and R2=0.336, respectively) Conclusions: Tang were decreased in CKD and could be considered as biomarkers of vascular dysfunction and very early atherosclerosis stage.

N2  - Aim: To evaluate short, medium- and long-term outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Background: Surgical parathyroidectomy is an important management for severe and refractory SHPT in patients with CKD. SHPT is associated with increased bone turnover, cardiovascular mortality and vascular calcification. Parathyroidectomy is associated with short-term morbidity and mortality but long-term survival benefit. There is limited Australian data on outcomes postparathyroidectomy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with CKD who underwent a parathyroidectomy for SHPT between January 2010 and January 2020 at a large tertiary referral centre. Biochemical outcomes and medication changes were examined 12 months pre- and post-surgery. Clinical outcomes, including hospital readmission, cardiovascular events and mortality were also assessed following parathyroidectomy. Results: A total of 142 patients underwent parathyroidectomy for SHPT during the 10-year period. Mean patient age was 50.8 ± 14.7 years, 119 (83.8%) patients were on dialysis (99 on haemodialysis). Fourteen patients (9.9%) had a previous parathyroidectomy or required re-do surgery during the study period. Significant immediate post-operative complications were seen in 10 patients, requiring admission to ICU (n = 8) or return to theatre (n = 2). Within the first 6 months, 27 patients (19%) required hospital readmission. Within 12 months post-parathyroidectomy, 105 (73.9%) and 111 (78.2%) patients experienced at least one episode of hypercalcaemia (corrected calcium >2.6 mmol/L) or hypocalcaemia (corrected calcium <2.1 mmol/L) respectively. Over a 12-month period there were three deaths, and eight patients experienced major cardiovascular events. Conclusion: Fluctuations in serum calcium leading to potentially serious adverse outcomes are common post-parathyroidectomy, with >70% of patients affected. This study highlights a need for medium- and long-term management guidelines to help minimize fluctuations post-surgery.

N2  - Background: Lanthanum carbonate is a commonly used phosphate binder in chronic kidney disease. Although known side effects include nausea, constipation and dyspepsia occur it has been traditionally thought to be safe and well tolerated. When digested Lanthanum carbonate readily binds to phosphate in our food and is usually excreted in stool as Lanthanum phosphate. Here we present Lanthanum deposition in mucosa of the stomach and duodenum leading us to question the safety of long term Lanthanum use. Case report: 56 year old Caucasian lady with end stage kidney disease secondary to hypokalaemic nephropathy secondary to Anorexia had been on dialysis since 2003. She has been taking Lanthanum since 2012. She had well controlled epilepsy and anorexia nervosa. CT-abdomen scan in 2018 was reported as showing vascular calcification of a dilated stomach and biopsies at the time were reported as showing calcification. She underwent a second gastroscopy in 2020 for persistent vomiting previously attributed to gastroparesis. Her gastroscopy showed patchy pale material in the mucosa a far as the major ampulla in the duodenum. Biopsies showed brown granular deposits and crystals within the histiocytes reported as consistent with Lanthanum carbonate. Conclusion: Lanthanum deposition may be incorrectly reported as calcification. The pathological significance of Lanthanum carbonate deposition in the gastrointestinal tract has not been established and further studies in the area are needed. It raises the question of safety for ongoing prescribing of a previously thought of harmless medication.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is well described in large- and medium-sized vessels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially in those with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis. Medial calcification is particularly prevalent in this population and contributes to arterial stiffness and increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Apart from inthe setting of calciphylaxis, few studies have assessed skin and subcutaneous calcification and associations with abnormalities of bone and mineral metabolism in patients with CKD. Methods: single-centre observational study to evaluate incisional skin tissue samples from anatomical sites in patients with different stages of CKD undergoing elective surgery. Skin samples compared to control cohort without CKD. Staining for calcification was performed with von Kossa method. A subgroup of skin samples were assessed by RT-PCR for upregulation of procalcific gene transcripts for tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). Results: 45 patients were evaluated, 34 with CKD and 11 control patients. VC identified in 15 skin samples (13 CKD and 2 controls). VC present in dermal and subcutaneous tissues of the neck, abdomen and arm samples. Two different histological types of VC were identified: medial calcification and internal elastic lamina calcification. Presence of perieccrine calcification was identified in 14 samples. There were no significant differences in serum parathyroid hormone, phosphate or calcium in patients with or without VC. Expression of TNAP or RUNX2 was not increased in samples from patients with ESKD or those with histological evidence of calcification. Conclusion: This study reports the novel finding of dermal and subcutaneous calcification in multiple anatomical locations in 38% of patients with advanced CKD/ESKD undergoing elective surgery but free from calciphylaxis.

N2  - Hyperphosphatemia has been proposed as a cardiovascular risk factor, contributing to long-term vascular calcification in hyperphosphatemic Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients. However, more recent studies have also demonstrated acute effects of inorganic phosphate (Pi) on endothelial cells in vitro, especially generation of pro-coagulant endothelial microvesicles (MV). Hitherto, such direct effects of hyperphosphatemia have not been reported in vivo. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to three experimental groups: (1) CKD induced by partial nephrectomy receiving high (1.2%) dietary phosphorus; (2) CKD receiving low (0.2%) dietary phosphorus; and (3) sham-operated controls receiving 1.2% phosphorus. After 14 days the animals were sacrificed and plasma MVs counted by nanoparticle tracking analysis. MVs isolated by centrifugation were assayed for pro-coagulant activity by calibrated automated thrombography, and relative content of endothelium-derived MVs was assessed by anti-CD144 immunoblotting. When compared with sham controls, high phosphorus CKD rats were shown to be hyperphosphatemic (4.11 ± 0.23 versus 2.41 ± 0.22 mM Pi, p < 0.0001) with elevated total plasma MVs (2.24 ± 0.37 versus 1.31 ± 0.24 × 108 per ml, p < 0.01), showing increased CD144 expression (145 ± 25% of control value, p < 0.0001), and enhanced procoagulant activity (18.06 ± 1.75 versus 4.99 ± 1.77 nM peak thrombin, p < 0.0001). These effects were abolished in the low phosphorus CKD group. In this rat model, hyperphosphatemia (or a Pi-dependent hormonal response derived from it) is sufficient to induce a marked increase in circulating pro-coagulant MVs, demonstrating an important link between hyperphosphatemia and thrombotic risk in CKD.

N2  - Vascular calcification progresses under hyperphosphatemia, and represents a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We recently indicated that phosphorus (P) fluctuations also exacerbated vascular calcification in early-stage CKD rats. Dietary fiber intake is reportedly associated with cardiovascular risk. This study investigated the effects of dietary fiber on vascular calcification by repeated P fluctuations in early-stage CKD rats. Unilateral nephrectomy rats were used as an early-stage CKD model. For 36 days, a P fluctuation (LH) group was fed low-P (0.02% P) and high-P (1.2% P) diets alternating every 2 days, and a P fluctuation with dietary fiber intake (LH + F) group was fed low-P and high-P diets containing dietary fiber alternating every 2 days. The effect on vascular calcification was measured calcium content. Effects on uremic toxin were measured levels of indoxyl sulfate (IS) and investigated gut microbiota. The LH + F group showed significantly reduced vessel calcium content compared to the LH group. Further, dietary fiber inhibited increases in blood levels of IS after intake of high-P diet, and decreased uremic toxin-producing intestinal bacteria. Dietary fiber may help suppress progression of vascular calcification due to repeated P fluctuations in early-stage CKD rats by decreasing uremic toxin-producing intestinal bacteria.

N2  - Introduction: Vascular calcification is the most significant predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but therapeutic options are unavailable. Relaxin has emerged as a vasoprotective molecule, but several drawbacks prevent therapeutic translation. Targeting the relaxin receptor, RXFP1, is safe and well-tolerated in animal models of vascular disease and humans. We identified a biased allosteric agonist of human RXFP1, ML290, and aimed to test the hypothesis that ML290 arrests the progression of vascular calcification in mouse models of atherosclerosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD).Methods and Results: Recurrent treatment with ML290 significantly prevented (P = 0.0422, n = 8) and reversed (P = 0.0489, n = 6) atherosclerotic calcification in humanized (hRXFP1/hRXFP1) Apoe-/- mice fed an atherogenic diet. Longitudinal tracing of mineral formation in the aortic arch of these mice revealed the presence of mineral in vehicle- but not ML290-treated mice after 15 weeks of diet. Accelerated mineral growth was observed in vehicle-treated mice after 20 weeks of the diet, which was reduced by ML290 treatment. In humanized mice with CKD, ML290 significantly prevented (P = 0.0344, n = 9) medial calcification. In vitro, ML290 reduced (P = 0.0005, n = 3) superoxide production under osteogenic conditions in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Osteogenic changes in VSMC phenotype associate with a release of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in extracellular vesicles (EVs), which promote mineralization. ML290 treatment significantly (P = 0.0001, n = 3) suppressed the formation of ALP-loaded EVs in vitro. Bone morphogenetic protein-4, an inducer of osteogenic transitions, and caveolin-1, a scaffolding protein required for calcifying EV formation, were significantly (P = 0.0059, n = 4) down-regulated after 24 h treatment with ML290 compared to vehicle-treated VSMCs under osteogenic conditions.Conclusions: We demonstrate the therapeutic potential for ML290 to mitigate atherosclerosis and CKD-induced vascular calcification in vivo. The actions of ML290 to prevent medial calcification are in part attributed to its ability to limit the release of calcifying EVs as a result of osteogenic differentiation, and to reduce vascular superoxide production.

N2  - Background. The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by thrombosis or pregnancy complications in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. Nephropathy is often associated and may evolve into a renal failure requiring hemodialysis. 1-4% of patients with end-stage kidney disease can develop calciphylaxis, a severe condition characterised by skin lesions and tissue necrosis due to vascular calcification, intimal hypertrophy and small vessel thrombosis leading to extensive ulceration, secondary infections, sepsis and death. Obesity, diabetes, hypoalbuminemia, female sex and Warfarin treatment can also be associated with calcium deposition in soft tissues and risk of calciphylaxis. Case report. We report a 30 year old man with APS, chronic renal failure and calciphylaxis. In 2004, he had a first deep vein thrombosis episode and APS was diagnosed. Subsequently, other episodes occurred, three of which complicated by pulmonary embolism. He was receiving long term therapy with Warfarin but time in therapeutic range was < 65% for poor adherence, obesity (BMI >40) and chronic kidney disease. In 2012, he underwent bilateral pulmonary thromboarteriectomy and developed a severe kidney failure requiring dialysis. In 2018 he underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and in the post-operative received thromboprophylaxis with Enoxaparin bridged with Warfarin and then Warfarin only. Two weeks after discharge he was admitted to the Emergency Room for a car accident, complaining of epigastric pain and nausea. An abdomen CT scan showed pancreatic necrosis with a gastric fistula that was healed by an endoscopic pancreatic stent removed after four weeks. At the same time painful and irregular shaped purple skin lesions appeared on the legs and abdomen. Diffuse necrosis and focal acute inflammation of subcutaneous tissue with intra- and peri-vascular microcalcifications, fibrointimal hyperplasia and microthrombi were shown by skin biopsy. Warfarin was discontinued and replaced with Heparin calcium. The patient was treated with sodium thiosulphate and antibiotics, but he suffered a pancreatic infection and sepsis by bacterial contamination. Moreover, he developed non-hepatic hyperammonemia with cognitive disturbances. In order to improve skin lesions, the infected ulcers were treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, due to the antibacterial activity and the direct toxic effect on anaerobic bacteria. In spite of efforts the patient died with septic shock. Conclusions. Review of the literature shows evidence for a possible role of the hypercoagulable state in the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis. Warfarin has been reported to be a risk factor for calciphylaxis probably through the matrix Gla protein, that is a vitamin K-dependent protein preventing calcium deposition in arteries. Warfarin inhibits Gla protein and therefore may promote vascular calcification in susceptible individuals.

N2  - Introduction: Kidney transplantation has considerably increased the survival and life quality of patients with end-stage renal disease. Objectives: The current study was designed to investigate the circulating level of dephosphorylateduncarboxylated matrix gamma carboxyglutamate protein (dp-ucMGP) as a marker of vitamin K status and vascular calcification in kidney transplant recipients as well as its association with the allograft function. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 90 eligible kidney transplant recipients were evaluated in the post-transplant phase (about 6-12 months after kidney transplantation). The serum levels of dp-ucMGP, urea, creatinine and other biochemical indices were determined. Results: The mean serum level of dp-ucMGP was 3.78±3.79 µg/L. Most of the participants (80%) had a normal range of serum dp-ucMGP (<4 µg/L). However, 10 % had high serum dp-ucMGP (>12 µg/L). Serum dp-ucMGP did not have any statistical significant association with serum urea, creatinine and kidney function (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Further epidemiologic studies are needed to assess the time trends of dp-ucMGP after renal transplant and its relation to kidney function, since high serum level of dp-ucMGP may make kidney transplant recipients prone to various cardiovascular disease (CVD) and transplant rejection.

N2  - Background and Aims: Vascular access planning is a crucial step in the path to dialysis treatment. Although the vascular surgeon role is of undeniable importance on vascular access creation, the nephrologist's view may be an added advantage on vascular access planning. Method: A retrospective observational study of the vascular access appointments carried out at the Centro Hospitalar De Tondela-Viseu's nephrology department between 1/1/2017 and 13/12/2019 was performed. Of the 173 consultations reviewed, 71 patients were referred to preoperative vascular mapping, which were selected. In those selected, 38 had a vascular access built. A descriptive and statistical analysis of the population and proposed vs constructed access was performed. Results: Of those patients referred to the vascular access appointment for vessel mapping, the median age was 70 years, the majority were men (59.2%), most of them had Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stage 5 (57.7%) and most frequently had Diabetic Nephropathy (38.6%) or Chronic Glomerulonephritis (14.9%) as the cause of kidney disease. The majority were Diabetic (62%), Hypertensive (91.5%), Obese (63.4%) and had a history of stroke, coronary or peripheral arterial disease (63.4%). The vascular mapping was performed for creation of first access in 64.8% of the patients and the nephrologist most commonly proposed a radio-cephalic fistula (63.6%) as first line access creation, followed by brachio-cephalic (30.3%) and brachio-basilic (6%) fistulas. An arteriovenous graft was suggested in only 1 case and 4 patients were not referred to the vascular surgeon as they had no vascular patrimony to autologous vascular access creation. Regarding those patients who had already a vascular access at the time of this study (n=36), 58.33% coincided with the first line access suggested by the nephrologist. We found that the nephrologist most frequently proposed a brachio-basilic fistula in older patients (median age 77.5), while younger patients had proposed other fistulas (median age 77.5 years, p=0.031). Those patients without history of stroke, coronary or peripheral arterial disease had 4.57 times more odds of being proposed to a radio-cephalic fistula (p=0.007) and those with history of atherosclerotic events had 4.36 times more odds of being proposed for a brachio-cephalic fistula (p=0.003). Patients with more vascular calcification on the vessel mapping appointment had 7 times more odds of not being proposed for a distal fistula (p=0.000) and had instead 5.56 times more odds of being proposed to a brachio-cephalic fistula (p=0.003). Gender, etiology of CKD, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure and obesity were not significantly associated with vascular access proposed by the nephrologist. Conclusion: In light of the results of this study, we conclude that there is an important place for ultrasound preoperative mapping by the nephrologist on planning the vascular access for haemodialysis.

N2  - Background and Aims: The stratification of early cardiovascular (CV) risk is a major unmet need in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since angiogenic T-cells are emerging mediators of vascular homeostasis and have been linked to CV disease (CVD), this study evaluated the frequency of circulating angiogenic T-cells in CKD patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (CKD-5D) and their potential as predictive biomarkers of CVD. Method: In 30 peritoneal dialysis patients and 16 matched healthy controls (HC), we quantified: Vascular calcification (by Kauppila Index); left carotid intima media thickness (lc-IMT by ultrasound), carotid adventitial vasa vasorum density (an early marker of atherosclerosis stage, by Superb Microvascular Ultrasound Image), pulse wave velocity (a marker of vascular stiffness and dysfunction, using the Complior Analyzer), angiogenic T cell frequency in blood (by Flow cytometry) and the traditional 10-year CVD risk (using the SCORE chart). Results: As expected, CKD-5D patients exhibited higher Kauppila index (p<0.001), lcIMT (p=0.010) and adventitial vasa vasorum density (p=0.008) than HC. Angiogenic-T cell frequency was decreased in CKD compared to HC (1.68(1.05) vs. 3.33(1.44)%, p<0.001). In CKD-5D patients, angiogenic-T cell frequency was not associated with blood pressure, cholesterol levels or time on dialysis (all p>0.05) and did not correlate with Kauppila (r=-0.350, p=0.080) or lcIMT (r=-0.154, p=0.600), but strongly associated negatively with both pulse wave velocity (r=-0.734, p<0.001) and with adventitial vasa vasorum (newly formed vasa vasorum) number: r=-0.640, p=0.006; or density: r=-0.813, p<0.001). Angiogenic-T cell levels paralleled pulse wave velocity (B[95% CI]: -0.083[-0.155, -0.010], p=0.028; R2=0.531) and adventitial vasa vasorum -15.049[-26.705, -3.392], p=0.015; R2=0.598) and improved the prediction model over that of the SCORE chart (R2=0.360 and R2=0.336, respectively). Conclusion: Angiogenic-T cell frequency was decreased in CKD-5D patients and could be considered as biomarkers of vascular dysfunction and early atherosclerosis stage.

N2  - Background and Aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem worldwide and refers to a wide range of disorders in bone and mineral metabolism, abnormalities of biochemical parameters and pathological calcification of the blood vessels. Vascular calcification (VC) is a common complication in CKD patients, contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD), and associates with increased mortality and morbidity. The precise mechanism of VC in CKD is not yet fully understood. Recently discovered molecules such as osteoprotegerin (OPG), its ligand receptor activator of nuclear factor NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and RANK are not only well-known to play a crucial role in bone homeostasis, but they has also been implicated in the process of development of vascular complications However the exact role of OPG/RANKL/RANK axis in the process of VC has not been yet fully assessed. Thus, the aim of this work is to evaluate the role of OPG/RANKL/RANK axis in the process of calcification in CKD. Method: Seventy two male Wistar rats weighing 260-290 g (8-weeks old) were initially divided into 6 groups containing 12 animals in each group. Rats were divided into six groups: control rats (K4, K6, K8) and CKD rats (B4, B6, B8). Control group rats received standard diet, whereas CKD rats were fed a low adenine -diet containing 0.3 %adenine, 1.0%Ca, 1.2%Pi through 4 (K4, B4), 6 (K6, B6) and 8 (K8, B8) weeks. Subsequently, CKD and control rats were sacrificed at weeks 4 (n=24), 6 (n=24) and 8 (n=24). One day before being killed, the rats were placed in metabolic cages for 24-hour urine collection. Thereafter, the rats were anesthetized and samples of blood, as well as aortas were collected. Next, the OPG, RANKL, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations were determined using appropriate ELISA kits. Then the sRANKL/OPG ratio was calculated. The OPG, RANK and RANKL gene expression was assessed using real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The VC was quantified by measurement of the arterial calcium (Ca) and phosphate (Pi) content using flame atomic absorption. Serum levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, Ca, Pi and urinary levels of creatinine, Ca and Pi were measured. Results: There was a progressive increase in serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid and PTH of CKD rats in comparison to control values. We also observed significantly decreased levels of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D and serum Ca. Total Ca content in the aorta was significantly increased in CKD rats in comparison with control group, whereas total Pi content in the aorta was significantly increased only in B8 group in comparison to appropriate controls. There were no differences in serum OPG and sRANKL levels between CKD and control rats. In contrast, we observed decreased OPG, RANKL and RANK gene expression in a B4 group in comparison to appropriate controls, whereas in a B6 group we noticed increased OPG, RANKL and decreased RANK gene expression. B8 group revealed increased RANKL and RANK gene expression, but there were no differences in OPG gene expression between CKD rats and control group. Furthermore, we observed positive correlations between serum sRANKL and OPG and RANK gene expression. Ca and P content in the aorta inversely corelated with RANKL gene expression, whereas positively with OPG gene expression. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations correlated inversely with Ca in aorta. PTH was positively correlated with serum RANKL and OPG and gene expression these cytokines. Conclusion: Our results suggest that OPG/RANK/RANKL axis may be involved in the process of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. However, its role and evaluation of precise mechanism in this field requires further evaluation.

N2  - Background and Aims: Atherosclerosis and its associated cardiovascular diseases starting from the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are the most important cause of increased morbi-mortality in the CKD process. In studies performed in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), it is observed that the calcification occured in the vascular structures was an important component of the atero-arteriolosclerosis process. The number of studies investigating the relationship between vascular calcification and the development of atherosclerosis and increased morbi-mortality in the process of CKD are quite small and limited to patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) treatment for ESRD. We aimed to investigate the factors affecting the development of atherosclerosis and the role of calcification inhibitors fetuin-A, matrix-Gla protein (MGP), osteoprotegerin (OPG) in atherosclerosis progress. Method: Our study was planned to investigate the relationship of serum OPG, MGP and fetuin-A levels with the development of atherosclerosis in the stage 2-3-4-5 chronic kidney patients who did not require dialysis treatment. Thirty-two (17 female, 15 male) healthy individuals and 92 (49 females, 43 males) CKD cases were included. The healthy control group did not have a history of regular use of medication for any reason, known acute or chronic disease. Chronic kidney disease group, with no acute disease, no history of known malignancy and cerebrovascular disease. The patients' GFR was also calculated with CKD-EPI Formula. The mean carotid artery intima media thickness was calculated by dividing the sum of right and left carotid artery intima media thickness. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0.0. Results: The laboratory data of the healthy control group, stage 2 CKD group, stage 3 CKD group, stage 4 CKD group and stage 5 CKD groups were statistically compared with the healthy control group, between themselves and the whole CKD group, the results were given in Table-1. Chronic kidney disease group divided into two groups; carotid artery intima media thickness less than 0.750 millimeters (without subclinical atherosclerosis) and those above 0.750 millimeters (with subclinical atherosclerosis). The mean C-IMT, CRP, FETUIN-A, OPG and MGP of the two groups were compared statistically and the results are shown in Table-2. In chronic kidney patients, age (r = 0.493, p <0.001), BMI (r = 0.337, p = 0.001), CRP (r = 0.301, p = 0.004), TG (r = 0.245, p = 0.019 ), urea (r = 0.228, p = 0.029), SBP (r = 0.212, p = 0.043), fasting blood sugar (r = 0.212, p = 0.043) have positive linear relationship, fetuin-A (r = -0.409, P = 0.001), OPG (r = -0.235, p = 0.024), GFR (r = -0.209, p = 0.046) have a negative linear relationship with CIMT. The multiple relationships between CIMT and other variables are given in Table-3. The mean CIMT (r =-0.417, p = 0.001), right CIMT (r = -0.412, p = 0.001), left CIMT (r = -0.410, p = 0.001), urea (r = -353, p = 0.007), CRP (r = -0.322, p = 0.014), UPE (r = -0.301, p = 0.022), creatinine (r = -0.277, p = 0.035), age (r = -0.262, p = 0.047) show a negative linear relationship with Fetuin-A. Multiple relationships between fetuin-A and other variables are given in Table-4. Conclusion: Our study shows that; In particular, fetuin-A levels, which is a vascular calcification inhibitor, begin to decline from the early stages of CKD and is significantly lower in patients with atherosclerosis. This suggests that fetuin-A may be used as an early marker in CKD with increased cardiovascular mortality. On the other hand, contradictions related to the levels of OPG and MGP in CKD and its role in the development of atherosclerosis continue. The results in our study also support this situation. Reducing mortality and morbidity in CKD primarily depends on reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Pre-recognition of these risks is important, so large-scale studies on vascular calcification inhibitors are needed. (Table Presented).

N2  - Background and Aims: Hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism are frequent complications in chronic kidney disease (CKD) which both contribute to increased morbidity and mortality in CKD. Osteogenic factor-1 (OP-1) is an important member of BMPs subfamily and its effects on CKD-associated mineral and bone disorders (MBD) is controversial. The study examined whether exogenous OP-1 administration can modulate disturbed CKD-MBD in adenine-induced chronic uremic rats Method: Chronic renal failure was induced in adult male SD rats by feeding adeninecontaining diet. After adenine diet feeding 3 weeks, animals were injected with OP-1 (5lg/kg/day) intraperitoneally for 2 weeks. The serum and urine phosphorus levels and associated mineral parameters, including fibroblast growth factor 23(FGF-23), DKK-1 and sclerostin were measured. Vascular calcification was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining on aortic tissue. Bony structure was evaluated by microCT (BrukermicroCT, Kontich, Belgium). Results: A significant decrease of body weight and deteriorated renal function was observed in adenine and OP-1 treatment groups during study period and serum creatinine levels were similar (5.23±1.1 mg/dL vs. 5.4±1.2 mg/dL, p>0.05). Animals in OP-1 group had lower serum phosphorous (18.7±5.1 vs. 29.0±9.6 mg/dL, p<0.05) and intact parathyroid hormone levels (2906.1±1206.9 vs. 4669.7±2505.9 pg/dL, p<0.05) compared to adenine group. Decreased urine phosphorous excretion was noted in both groups without significant difference. Levels of serum FGF-23, sclerostin and DKK-1 were significantly lower in OP-1 treatment group (all p< 0.05). OP-1 administration diminished the staining of RUNX2 (59.1±3% of adenine-treated group), alkaline-phosphatase (49.4±5.7%), b-caterin (39.3±1.8%), BMP2 (43.2%±6.7%), and BMP7 (51.9±10%, all p<0.05). MicroCT revealed that bone mineral density was increased by OP-1 treatment (0.46±0.1 vs.0.39±0.06 g/cm3). Total volume was increased but bone volume was not changed. OP-1 administration did not affect trabecular thickness and trabecular number. Conclusion: Our data indicated administration of exogenous OP-1 improved hyperparathyroidism and attenuated vascular calcification. OP-1 treatment was also associated with beneficial effects on bony structure in animals with renal failure.

N2  - Background and Aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a globally increasing health problem especially in aged era. CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) becomes a principal consequence of CKD, which includes mineral abnormalities, vascular calcifications (VC) and renal osteodystrophy (ROD), and patients eventually present with fractures and cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Figure 1). Thus, bone loss in CKD patients relates closely with cardiovascular calcification. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is triggered by many clinical conditions unique to CKD, including uremic toxins, chronic inflammation, metabolic acidosis, proteinuria, malnutrition, etc. In our study, we hope to evaluate the ER stress inhibitor, salubrinal as targeted therapy for CKD related bone loss and vascular calcification. Methods: Isolation of primary osteoclasts from long bone primary cell culture: Femoral and tibia bone from 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were removed and used as primary osteoclast cultures. Osteoclast precursor cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2.0 x 104 cells/well) and cultured for 6 days in alpha minimum essential medium(a-MEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 50 ng/ml M-CSF and 50 ng/ml RANKL in the absence or presence of uremic toxins. The whole process of osteoclast development in cell cultures was divided into first M-CSF-dependent growth of osteoclast progenitor's phase and latter phase is RANKL induced terminal differentiation phase. The experiment is performed with the approval of the Laboratory Animal Center of the Taipei Medical University in Taipei, Taiwan. Primary Human Aorta Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Culture: Primary human aorta vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) were isolated by ScienCell Research Laboratories, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA) and purchased through Innoprot (Derio, Spain). We examined the role of uremic toxin on ER stress and autophagy using osteoclasts and vascular smooth muscle cells cultured with uremic toxins including PTH, p-cresylsulfate (pCS) and p-cresylglucuronide (pCG), indoxyl sulfate, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and homocysteine. The cells are treated with salubrinal with or without toxins and see how ER stress and autophagy effects on survival and differentiation of osteoclasts and VSMC cells. Results: We found that ER stress and autophagy related mRNA were increased in osteoclasts using GEO database analysis, revealed that ER stress and autophagy play an important role in osteoclast differentiation. Further, we revealed that uremic toxins increased the autophagy and ER stress status and increased the osteoclasts differentiation. Treatment of the osteoclasts under uremic millennium with salubrinal, an ER stress inhibitor, inhibited the ER stress and osteoclast differentiation. Uremic toxins also increased the ER stress in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). After treated with salubrinal, the calcification and proliferation improved in these cells. Conclusion: ER stress increases osteoclast differentiation and vascular calcification in uremic millennium, and salubrinal improves these conditions through inhibition of ER stress. Thus, salubrinal probably might be used as targeted therapy for vascular calcification and bone loss in CKD patients.

N2  - Background and Aims: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to complex processes in the uremic milieu linked to CKD -mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD). These processes alter structure and function of heart and vasculature e.g. by causing ectopic calcification that makes vessels stiffer thus affecting pulse (pressure) wave profiles. Our study aimed to derive patientspecific parameters using pulse wave propagation model including arterial stiffness and compare those parameters with cardiovascular status including biopsy proven severity of vascular calcification. Method: In a group of 81 CKD (stage 5) patients undergoing living donor kidney transplantation, the degree of medial calcification in epigastric artery was histologically graded as 0 (n=22), 1 (n=31), 2 (n=21) and 3 (n=7) representing no, minimal, moderate and extensive signs of vascular calcification, respectively. Concomitantly 82 features were determined including demographic and anthropometric features, blood biomarkers related to CKD -MBD and other measurements. Pressure profiles (circles in Fig. 1) in radial artery were recorded using applanation tonometer (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical, Australia) and used to derive patient-specific parameters from a mathematical model describing blood flow and pressure in 55 major arteries. Results: The model was able to reproduce all recorded pressure profiles with high accuracy with average relative error less than 8% (compare solid line and circles in Fig. 1). Vascular stiffness, derived from the model, in arterial branches located in the area of artery for which calcification was histologically quantified, was significantly higher for higher calcification score (p-value < 0.001). The estimated stiffness correlated with the level of troponin T (rho=0.65∗ ∗), advanced glycation end-products (by skin autofluorescence, rho=0.55∗), osteoprotegerin (rho=0.44∗ ∗), hepcidin 25 (rho=0.32∗, interleukin 6 (rho=0.29∗) and choline (rho=0.28∗ ∗), ('∗ ∗' and '∗' denote p-value < 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). Stiffer arteries were found in patients with diagnosed CVD (p-value < 0.01). Conclusion: We demonstrate that a mathematical model based on a single peripheral recording of pulse pressure profile has the potential to provide information about cardiovascular status in the individual patient. Also, the estimated stiffness correlates well with several well-established CVD risk factors. Our mathematical model of the arterial tree, if validated in larger cohorts of patients, may be used as computational tool to predict vascular stiffness without need of arterial biopsy.

N2  - Background and Aims: Vascular calcification as cause of vascular stiffness is a major contributor to the high cardiac burden among stage 5 chronic kidney disease dialysis (CKD5HD) patients. Early identification of patients with high calcification propensity is crucial for proper risk stratification and management of these patients. Recently, a novel in vitro test (T50-test) was developed which determines calcification propensity of human serum and predicts mortality among ND-CKD (non-dialysis chronic kidney disease) patients, kidney transplant recipients and CKD5HD patients suffering from secondary hyperparathyroidism. We now evaluated whether these results can be confirmed in an unselected cohort of CKD5HD patients and can be used in the future for improving care of these patients. Method: This prospective clinical study included 776 incident and prevalent hemodialysis patients from 8 Fresenius Medical Care NephroCare centers in Cataluña (Spain). T50 was determined at Calciscon AG, all other clinical data were retrieved from the European Clinical Database (EuCliD®). After their baseline T50 measurement, patients were followed for two years for the occurrence of the primary endpoint all-cause mortality. The association between T50 and all-cause mortality was examined by using proportional subdistribution hazards regression modelling accounting for kidney transplantation as competing event. In sensitivity analyses we adjusted for age, sex, vascular access (fistula/graft, catheter), treatment modality (HD, HDF), Charlson comorbidity index and dialysis vintage. Results: Mean age of the study population was 72.2 years and 63.8% were male. 42.5% had diabetes and 55.0% past history of cardiovascular disease. Mean T50 was 283.4 min among the total cohort. During follow-up, 185 (23.8%) patients died. Patients who reached the endpoint had a significantly lower T50 at baseline as compared to those who survived during follow-up (269.6 vs 287.7 min, p = 0.001). A cross-validated model (mean c statistic: 0.5767) identified T50 as a linear predictor of all-cause-mortality (subdistribution hazard ratio (per min): 0.9957, 95% CI [0.9933;0.9981]). T50 remained a significant predictor of all-cause mortality after adjusting for relevant confounding in sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: In this prospective study, we confirmed that T50 is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality among a large unselected cohort of hemodialysis patients. T50 may be used to identify patients with high vascular calcification propensity and mortality risks and may help physicians to implement a personalized and more precise renal replacement therapy option.

N2  - Background and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is a consequence of ageing that confers development of future cardiovascular events. Accumulation of senescent cells can lead to structural and functional abnormalities in vessel wall towards increased stiffness, reduced compliance and impaired contractile and dilatory capacity. Thus, accumulation of senescent cells in the arterial wall could also contribute to the pathophysiology of VC. To test this hypothesis, the presence of cellular markers of senescence, p16, p21 and NRF2, was assessed in aorta from rat model of VC associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Method: Six-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 5/6th subtotal nephrectomy (SNx, n=6) or no surgery (Control, n=1). After 8 weeks of renal failure, the regular chow was supplemented with high phosphate (1.2%) and vitamin D (1 μg/day 5 days per week) for 1 or 4 weeks to initiate vascular calcification (SNx-VC group). At the end of the protocol (Figure 1), blood pressure was measured, and thoracic aorta was taken for determination of calcification by Von Kossa staining, and protein and gene expressions of p16, p21, and NRF2 by immunostaining and qPCR, respectively. Results: After 4 weeks of dietary intervention, SNx rats showed an increase in pulse pressure (88±15mmHg vs 35 mmHg for the control). Marked VC was also observed in these animals, 17% of calcified area vs <1%in the control rat. Calcification was focal giving strong and no calcified areas on the same aorta. Expressions of p16, p21and NRF2 proteins were enhanced at the site of calcification in the SNx-VC 4-week (4W) group whereas it was unchanged in aortic media without calcification compared to the control rat (Figure 2). In SNx-VC 1-week (1W) rats, no change in pulse pressure or vascular calcification was observed without obvious changes for staining patterns of selected markers. Using qPCR we found p16 gene expression to be higher in the most calcified aortas (4W) (fold-change = 4.32 vs 1W) and p21 gene expression to be slightly increased (fold-change = 0.53 vs 1W). NRF2 gene expression was enhanced in 1W group compared to control, but decreased in the most calcified samples (4W). Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that uraemia-induced cellular senescence accompanies VCs, as suggested by the modified expression of p16 or NRF2 genes. Our observations deserve exploration in larger studies using additional senescence markers for validation. If so, cellular senescence kinetics will be evaluated in order to test whether senolytics compounds could be a therapeutic option to arrest VC in CKD. (Figure Presented).

N2  - A main obstacle to diagnose and manage renal osteodystrophy (ROD) is the identification of intracortical bone turnover type (low, normal, high). The gold standard, tetracycline-labeled transiliac crest bone biopsy, is impractical to obtain in most patients. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes Guidelines recommend PTH and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) for the diagnosis of turnover type. However, PTH and BSAP have insufficient diagnostic accuracy to differentiate low from non-low turnover and were validated for trabecular turnover. We hypothesized that four circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate osteoblast (miRNA-30b, 30c, 125b) and osteoclast development (miRNA-155) would provide superior discrimination of low from non-low turnover than biomarkers in clinical use. In 23 patients with CKD 3-5D, we obtained tetracycline-labeled transiliac crest bone biopsy and measured circulating levels of intact PTH, BSAP, and miRNA-30b, 30c, 125b, and 155. Spearman correlations assessed relationships between miRNAs and histomorphometry and PTH and BSAP. Diagnostic test characteristics for discriminating low from non-low intracortical turnover were determined by receiver operator curve analysis; areas under the curve (AUC) were compared by χ2 test. In CKD rat models of low and high turnover ROD, we performed histomorphometry and determined the expression of bone tissue miRNAs. Circulating miRNAs moderately correlated with bone formation rate and adjusted apposition rate at the endo- and intracortical envelopes (ρ = 0.43 to 0.51; p < 0.05). Discrimination of low versus non-low turnover was 0.866, 0.813, 0.813, and 0.723 for miRNA-30b, 30c, 125b, and 155, respectively, and 0.509 and 0.589 for PTH and BSAP, respectively. For all four miRNAs combined, the AUC was 0.929, which was superior to that of PTH and BSAP alone and together (p < 0.05). In CKD rats, bone tissue levels of the four miRNAs reflected the findings in human serum. These data suggest that a panel of circulating miRNAs provide accurate noninvasive identification of bone turnover in ROD. © 2020 The Authors.

N2  - Background: The prevalence of vertebral fractures (VF) and their association with clinical risk factors and outcomes are poorly documented in chronic kidney disease (CKD) cohorts. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of VF in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD (NDD-CKD), their value in predicting mortality and its correlation with parameters of bone mineral metabolism and vascular calciﬁcation. Materials and Methods: 612 NDD 3-5 stage CKD patients participating in the OSERCE-2 study, a prospective, multicenter, cohort study, were prospectively evaluated and categorized into two groups according to presence or absence of VF at enrollment. VF were assessed with lateral radiographs and Genant semi-quantitative method was applied. Three radiologists specialized in musculoskeletal radiology performed consensual reading of individual images obtained using a Raim DICOM Viewer and a Canon EOS 350 camera to measure with Java Image software in those who had traditional acetate X-ray. Factors related to VF were assessed by logistic regression analysis. Association between VF and death over a 3-year follow-up was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox-proportional hazard models. Results: VF were detected in 110patients(18%). Serumphosphatelevels(OR0.719,95%CI0.532to0.972,p = 0.032),ankle-brachial index < 0.9 (OR 1.694, 95% CI 1.056-2.717, p = 0.029) and treatment with bisphosphonates (OR 5.636, 95% CI 1.876-16.930, p = 0.002) were independently related to the presence of VF. After a median follow-up of 35 months (IQR: 17-37 months), 62 patients (10%) died. The causes of death were cardiovascular (n = 21, 34%) and infectious (n = 11, 18%). In the crude analysis, fractured patients group had poorer survival (log-rank test, p = 0.02). After multivariate adjustment for age, MDRD, albumin, diabetes mellitus, comorbidity, Adragao Score > 3 and serum phosphate, the presence of VF (HR 1.983, 95% CI 1.009-3.898, p = 0.047) were an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Conclusions: In our study 18% of patients with NDD-CKD have VF. Factors associated with VF were age, low serum phosphate levels and peripheral vascular disease. The presence of VF was an independent risk factor for mortality in stages 3-5 NDD-CKD patients. Clinical trials are needed to conﬁrm whether this relationship is causal and reversible with treatment for osteoporosis.

N2  - Background: Uremic vascular calcification (UVC) is reminiscent of osteogenesis and apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC). We aimed to identify how circulating procalcific particles dramatically leak into VSMC layer in human tissue models of vascular rings. Methods: According to baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), patients following lower extremity amputation were divided into three groups: normal renal function (eGFR ≧ 60 ml/min), mild-to-moderate (15 ml/min < eGFR ≧ 60 ml/min) and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR ≦ 15 ml/min). Arterial specimens with immunohistochemistry stain were quantitatively analyzed for UVC, internal elastic lamina (EL) disruption, α-SMA, osteogenesis, apoptosis, and oxidative injury. Correlations among UVC severity, eGFR, EL disruption, osteogenesis, and oxidative injury were investigated. Results: CKD arteries were associated with eGFR-dependent EL disruption corresponding to UVC severity. CKD arteries exhibited lower α-SMA, higher expressions of caspase-3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), indicative of contractile VSMC loss, and apoptosis. Enhanced expressions of alkaline phosphatase and Runx2 were presented in VSMCs of CKD arteries, indicative of osteogenic differentiation. Above eGFR-dependent UVC and EL disruption correlated expressions of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), indicating oxidative EL injury promoted procalcific processes. Conclusions: Circulating uremic milieu triggers vascular oxidative stress, leading to progressive internal EL disruption as a key event in disabling VSMC defense mechanisms and catastrophic mineral ion influx into VSMC layer. Oxidative EL injury begins in early CKD, corresponding with active VSMC re-programming, apoptosis, and ultimately irremediable UVC. In light of this, therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative tissue injury might be of vital importance to hinder the progression of UVC related cardiovascular events.

N2  - Vascular calcification (VC) is one of the strongest predictors of cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. New diagnostic/prognostic tools are required for early detection of VC allowing interventional strategies. Gla-rich protein (GRP) is a cardiovascular calcification inhibitor, whose clinical utility is here highlighted. The present study explores, for the first time, correlations between levels of GRP in serum with CKD developmental stage, mineral metabolism markers, VC and pulse pressure (PP), in a cohort of 80 diabetic patients with mild to moderate CKD (stages 2–4). Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed a positive association of GRP serum levels with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and α-Klotho, while a negative correlation with phosphate (P), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), vascular calcification score (VCS), PP, calcium (x) phosphate (CaxP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Serum GRP levels were found to progressively decrease from stage 2 to stage 4 CKD. Multivariate analysis identified low levels of eGFR and GRP, and high levels of FGF-23 associated with both the VCS and PP. These results indicate an association between GRP, renal dysfunction and CKD-mineral and bone disorder. The relationship between low levels of GRP and vascular calcifications suggests a future, potential utility for GRP as an early marker of vascular damage in CKD.

N2  - Objective: Vascular calcification is a major cause of cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate whether the use of antiplatelet agents and statins improve vascular calcification and other risk factors in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Design: Retrospective study Setting: Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Inha University Hospital, Republic of Korea Subject: This study included patients with end-stage renal disease who were administered peritoneal dialysis center. Intervention: Medical records of all the patients were reviewed and the data were collected retrospectively. Main outcome measures: The severity and extent of vascular calcification were scored using a semi-quantitative scale ranging from 0 to 8 (Adragao’s method). The patient characteristics were compared according to their vascular calcification score. Results: The 156 study patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis had an average vascular calcification score (VCS) of 2.9 ± 2.7. The VCS was significantly higher in patients with diabetes and increased age but was significantly lower in those prescribed an antiplatelet agent or statin (for >2 years). Patients who used both statins and antiplatelet agents (1.9 ± 2.4) showed a more significant improvement in vascular calcification than those who used antiplatelet agents alone (3.3 ± 2.6) or none of the agents (4.2 ± 2.6) did. In the logistic regression analysis, the statin and antiplatelet agent group showed 0.65 times lower VCS than the control group. Conclusions: Concurrent use of antiplatelet agents and statins decreased vascular calcification in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

N2  - Introduction: Renin-angiotensin aldosterone system blockers (RASB) is main stream of management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vitamin D (vitD) is known as a potent negative regulator of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system via vitamin D receptor. VitD deficiency often presents, even in early CKD. However, there is no a definite guideline of use of vitD in CKD. In addition, the use of vitD should be given a careful attention due to development of hypercalcemia or vascular calcification in CKD. Now, we report results of a 1-year study for combination therapy of calcitriol and RASB in patients with pre-dialytic CKD and vitD deficiency. Methods: Forty five patients with pre-dialytic CKD and proteinuria >500 mg/day despites of RASB during at least 6 months were enrolled. We prescribed calcitriol of 0.5 μg, thrice weekly only in patients with serum calclium <10 mg/dL and 25(OH)vitD of <15 ng/mL. Only a total 27 patients received combination therapy of calcitriol and RASB, and laboratory data were retrospectively analyzed. Urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) at baseline was measured. UACR and serum creatinine were followed with 6-month interval. We also divided the enrolled patients into two groups, early CKD and advanced CKD group, based on eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73m2. We performed a comparative analysis for impacts of combination therapy on albuminuria and renal function in the groups based on eGFR. Results: Total 27 patients used calcitriol and RASB. Eleven patients among the 27 patients were classified into early CKD group and sixteen patients were classified into advanced CKD group. Total 18 patients used only RASB. Twelve patients among the 18 patients were classified into early CKD group and six patients were classified into advanced CKD group. (Table 1,2: not shown in the abstract) In combination group, UACR were 3.15 g/g ± 3.82 at baseline and fell to 2.28 g/g ± 2.90 and 1.91 g/g ± 2.75 after 6 and 12 months. (p=0.031 and p=0.096, respectively) (Table 3) Moreover, in RASB only group, UACR were 1.05 g/d ± 1.71 at baseline and fell to 0.34 g/g ± 0.37 and 0.74 g/g ± 1.13 after 6 and 12 months. (p=0.039 and p=0.133, respectively) (Table 4) Change of UACR after 6 months from baseline did not show statistical significance in both groups. However, in combination group, when subgroup analyses were performed in early CKD and advanced CKD, UACR were 3.61 g/g ± 4.13 at baseline and significantly fell to 2.44 g/g ± 3.04 and 1.17 g/g ± 1.68 after 6 and 12 months (p=0.005 and p=0.022, respectively) in only early CKD. In addition, change of GFR in early CKD patients received combination therapy did not decrease significantly during 12 months. (p=0.099) (Table 3) Moreover, we performed a comparative analysis between combination and RASB only to identify effect of calcitriol on UACR according to time. The difference of decreasing UACR between combination and RASB only group was not statistically significant in both groups, however, in early CKD patients, the difference based on time between both groups seemed to be significant. (p=0.05) (Table 4 and Figure 1) [Formula presented] [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusions: Our study didnot show a significant impact on albuminuria of vitD combination therapy compared with only RASB therapy. However, if sample size and study-duration are expanded, combination therapy might show negative impact on albuminuria, particularly in early CKD patients with persistent proteinuria despites of use of RASB.

N2  - Introduction: Global prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is still high, where most of patients will further progress into CKD stage V which requires routine hemodialysis (CKD5HD). CKD5HD has a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality because of vascular calcification. Pathogenesis of vascular calcification includes chronic hiperphosphatemia and imbalance between promoters and inhibitors of vascular calcification. Fetuin A is one of the inhibitors for vascular calcification. The aim of this study is to determine the correlation between Fetuin A level with serum phosphate and hs-CRP levels in CKD5HD patients. Methods: This is an observational study with cross-sectional study design in 50 patients undergoing routine hemodialysis at Dr Kariadi Semarang Hospital in Indonesia. Inclusion criteria were age >15 years old, normal body temperature, has been undergoing hemodialysis for >3 months, and normal liver function tests. Patient with corticosteroid therapy, had previous history of malignancy, and icteric, hemolysis, or lipemic samples were excluded from this study. Results: The mean age was 54,78 ± 9,99 years old. The average length of undergoing hemodialysis was 25,44 ± 35,73 months. There was a correlation between hs-CRP and Fetuin A levels (r= -0,438; p=0,001) but there was no correlation between serum phosphate and Fetuin A levels (r=0,286; p=0,057). Conclusions: There was a weak correlation between hs-CRP and fetuin A levels in CKD5HD, but there was no correlation between phosphate and fetuin A levels in CKD5HD. Further research is needed to determine the Fetuin A cut-off level for vascular calcification occurrence in CKD5HD.

N2  - Background: Calcemic uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), or calciphylaxis, is an uncommon disorder presenting clinically as skin ischemia and necrosis and histologically as vascular calcification and thrombosis of dermal and subdermal vasculature. Outcomes remain poor with high mortality rates. Due to the seriousness of the condition, it is important that clear diagnosis of CUA is established in order to initiate proper treatment, e.g. sodium thiosulfate. Observation: We report two Filipino females with chronic kidney disease presenting with violaceous plaques and ulcers with eschar formation. Biopsies showed extensive dermal necrosis and calcifications of the vessels of the subcutaneous fat with multiple amorphous basophilic material and adipocyte necrosis. Histologic examination remains the gold standard for diagnosis of CUA, and has been described as a morphologic spectrum of a calcific thrombogenic microangiopathy that begins with medial vascular calcification of small dermal and subcutaneous arterioles, leading to skin ischemia and eventual necrosis. Sensitivity can be increased by demonstrating microcalcifications through special stains. Current evidence on its pathogenesis points to active transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteochondrocytic phenotypes, as well as deficiencies and defects in the function of inhibitors of vascular calcification. The histology varies depending on the stage of evolution, hence no definitive histopathologic criteria exists. Key message: Calcemic uremic arteriolopathy is an uncommon disorder in ESRD patients that is mainly a calcific thrombotic vascular disorder. Key histopathologic findings to diagnose CUA include calcifications (distinct and microcalcifications) of dermal and subcutaneous vessels, vascular thrombosis and subsequent ischemic necrosis of the dermis and panniculus. The histologic findings are diverse and represent a morphologic spectrum following its pathophysiology.

N2  - Objective: To explore the correlation of FGF-23 and OPG with vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: Altogether 154 patients with CKD admitted to Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University of Engineering were selected. Among them, 83 patients with vascular calcification were regarded as the research group (RG). Another 71 patients without vascular calcification were regarded as the control group (CG). The expression of FGF-23 and OPG before operation in RG and CG, the correlation between FGF-23 and OPG in RG, the predictive value of FGF-23 and OPG on vascular calcification, the changes of FGF-23 and OPG expression during treatment, and the risk factors affecting vascular calcification were observed. Results: FGF-23 in RG was higher than that in CG before operation, while OPG was lower than that in CG before operation (P <0.05). FGF-23 was negatively related to OPG before operation in RG (r =-0.608, P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of FGF-23 for predicting vascular calcification were 74.65% and 83.13%, respectively. OPG had a predictive sensitivity of 66.20% and specificity of 78.31% for vascular calcification. The sensitivity and specificity of FGF-23 combined with OPG for predicting vascular calcification were 84.51% and 83.13%, respectively. FGF-23 in RG was higher than that CG at T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4. FGF-23 was highest at T0, began to decline at T1, and was lowest at T4 (P < 0.05). OPG in RG was lower than that CG at T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4. OPG was lowest at T0, began to rise at T1 and was highest at T4 (P < 0.05). Blood glucose, blood lipids, FGF-23 and OPG were independent risk factors for vascular calcification (P<0.05). Conclusion: FGF-23 is increased in CKD patients with vascular calcification, while OPG is decreased. Both of them are related to CKD vascular calcification, and may be important observation indicators of vascular calcification in CKD patients.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death among hemodialysis patients. Hyperphosphatemia induces cardiovascular disease through vascular endothelial dysfunction and calcification. Repetition of a short-term excessive-phosphorus (P) diet causes transient elevations in plasma P and subsequent vascular endothelial dysfunction in normal rats. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the P fluctuation on vascular calcification and inflammation in rats after unilateral nephrectomy as an early-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) model. Rats were bred for 36 days; CP group, fed a control P (0.6%) diet; HP group, fed a high-P (1.2%) diet; and P fluctuation group, fed low-P (0.02%) and high-P diets alternately every 2 days. Influences on vascular calcification were analyzed using Von Kossa staining and measurement of vessel Ca content. The influence on inflammation was measured as urinary levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. We demonstrated that the P fluctuation group showed similar vascular calcification and inflammation to the HP group, despite having the same total P intake as the CP group. A diet avoiding P fluctuations may be important for patients with early-stage CKD.

N2  - Introduction: Penile calciphylaxis is a rare disease whose diagnosis is not easy. It is associated with chronic renal failure. It is a result of media calcification and blood vessels’ fibrosis such as penile arteries that eventually lead to gangrene formation in extremities and penis. Calcific uremic arteriolopathy is commonly associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and high level of calcium and phosphate. Presentation of case: In this paper, we report a case of penile necrosis induced by calciphylaxis associated with chronic renal failure and diabetic macroangiopathy. We performed a partial and total amputation in two stages because of the wound infection. The patient died one week after a total penectomy. Discussion: The skin biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis despite being a risky process. In most cases, appropriate medical management is advocated. The treatment of this pathology is still controversial. Conclusion: The management of this rare situation is controversial, and its diagnosis is still difficult due to the scarcity of reported cases.

N2  - Objective: We sought to investigate the effect of variations in pH on vascular calcification (VC) in rats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the expression of Runt-related transcription factor 2. Methods: A total of healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats of a clean grade were randomly stratified into a control group, CKD group, CKD with VC (CKD+VC) group, acid intervention (CKD+VC+AC) group, and alkaline intervention (CKD+VC+AC) group. Rat models with CKD, chronic metabolic acidosis, and chronic metabolic alkalosis were established. Rat arterial pH values and HCO3- concentrations were detected by blood gas analysis. Serum creatinine (SCR) and urea nitrogen (BUN) content were detected by automatic biochemical analysis. Calcium content was determined by o-cresol oxime complex ketone colourimetry. The calcification condition of rat thoracic aorta and Runt-related transcription factor 2 expression were detected by Von Kossa staining and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: The levels of SCR and BUN were much higher in the CKD group, CKD+VC group, CKD+VC+AC group, and CKD+ VC+BC group than in the control group (P<0.05). Separately, pH level and HCO3- concentration results were much lower in the CKD+VC+AC group than in the CKD+VC group (P<0.05) but were much higher in the CKD+VC+BC group than in the CKD+VC group (P<0.05). Also, the calcium contents of the thoracic aorta were significantly higher in the CKD+VC and CKD+VC+BC groups than in the control group, much lower in the CKD+VC+AC group than in the control group, and much higher in the CKD+VC+BC group than in the control group. (P<0.05). There were many brown-black calcium deposits noted in the media layer of the thoracic aorta of rats in the CKD+VC group and CKD+VC+BC group (P<0.05), while no such findings were observed in the control group, CKD group, or CKD+ VC+AC group (P<0.05); further, the level of brown-black calcium deposition in the media layer of the thoracic aorta was much higher in the CKD+VC+BC group than in the CKD+VC group (P<0.05). Finally, the CKD+VC group and CKD+VC+BC group had significantly higher RUNX2 immunohistochemical scores than did the control group or CKD group (P<0.05), while the RUNX2 immunohistochemical scores were much lower in the CKD+VC+BC but much higher in the CKD+VC+BC group than in the CKD+VC group (P<0.05). Conclusions: An acidic pH environment inhibits the occurrence of VC in rats with CHD and an alkaline environment promotes VC in rats with the same, which may be achieved by regulating RUNX2 expression.

N2  - Introduction. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with high mortality rates, mainly as a result of cardiovascular complications. Meanwhile, recent studies have suggested a role of a homodimer protein called activin A in chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) conditions that may exist in the vascular calcification and osteolytic process. Ultrasound examination of the carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is a noninvasive method to assess vascular calcification. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between the activin A serum level and cIMT in patients with CKD at Mohammad Hoesin Hospital, Palembang, Indonesia. Methods. We conducted a hospital-based, cross-sectional study of consecutive CKD patients at the Department of Internal Medicine, Mohammad Hoesin Hospital, from July to November 2019. The level of activin A was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Meanwhile, cIMT measurements were collected by B-mode ultrasound imaging. Results. A total of 55 patients with CKD were included in this investigation. The median serum activin A level in these patients was 236.17 (116.33-283) pg/mL, while the median cIMT was 0.8 (0.6-1.45) mm. A relationship between the serum activin A level and cIMT (r = 0.449; p=0.001) was observed. During multivariate analysis with linear regression, triglyceride p=0.049, phosphate p=0.005, and activin A p=0.020 serum levels were factors associated with cIMT. Conclusion. In this study, a relationship between the activin A serum level and cIMT in patients with CKD was identified. Vascular calcification should be screened for in all CKD patients by the measurement of cIMT.

N2  - Background: Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 is a phosphaturic hormone that promotes phosphate (Pi) excretion. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), serum levels of Pi & FGF23 gradually rise as renal function declines & associates with various pathologies such as systemic inflammation, anemia, vascular calcification & muscle wasting. Our previous studies have showed FGF23 induces inflammatory cytokine expression by targeting hepatocytes via FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4). Other studies have shown Pi accelerates vascular calcification. However, whether Pi contributes to inflammation, anemia or skeletal muscle wasting remains unclear. Here we compare theeffects of Pi versus FGF23 to determine their contributions towards these CKD-associated pathologies, utilizing in vivo & in vitro models. Methods: We subject mice with global FGFR4 deletion & wild-type littermates to an increasing dietary Pi load (0.7%, 2.0%, or 3.0%) or an adenine-rich diet (CKD model) to examine systemic inflammation, iron metabolism and skeletal muscle function. Furthermore, we study primary hepatocytes treated with FGF23 or Pi to examine activation of downstream signaling events & expression levels of specific target genes. We determine if co-treatment with inhibitors of Pi uptake & of downstream mediators block these observed effects. Results: A 3% Pi diet as well as an adenine-rich diet promote inflammation, iron dysregulation & skeletal muscle wasting in mice. Outcomes are not alleviated in FGFR4 knockout mice. Furthermore, liver Pi accumulation occurs before hyperphosphatemia, as shown by 2% Pi diet. In cultured hepatocytes, inflammatory cytokine and hepcidin expression are induced by Pi in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Pi activates NFkB signaling. Blocking Pi uptake & NFkB attenuates the observed Pi-induced effects. Conclusions: We postulate in CKD, gradual elevations in serum Pi as well as tissue Pi accumulation, which may occur before detectable changes in systemic Pi, promotes inflammation & anemia by targeting the liver to induce gene programs that regulate inflammatory responses & iron metabolism. In turn, these events promote muscle wasting. Our study indicates these Pi effects may be FGF23-independent. Pharmacological approaches targeting Pi uptake and excretion or Pi's direct hepatic actions may alleviate various CKD-associated pathologies.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) increases the future risk of cardiovascular events in uremic patients, but effective therapies are still unavailable. Accurate identification of those at risk of developing VC using pathogenesis-based biomarkers is of particular interest and may facilitate individualized risk stratification. We aimed to uncover miRNA-target protein-based biomarker panels for evaluating uremic VC probability and severity. Methods: We created a 3-tiered in vitro VC model and an in vivo uremic rat model receiving high phosphate diet to mimic uremic VC. RNAs from the in vitro and in vivo models underwent miRNA and mRNA microarray, with results screened for differentially expressed miRNAs and their target genes as biomarkers. Findings were validated in all models and human cells, followed by functional assays of identified miRNAs, and tests of sera from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients without and with VC. Results: Totally 122 down-regulated and 119 up-regulated miRNAs during calcification progression were identified initially; further list-narrowing based on miRNA-mRNA pairing, anti-correlation, and functional enrichment left 16 and 14 differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. Levels of 4 miRNAs (miR-10b-5p, miR-195, miR-125b-2-3p, and miR-378a-3p) were shown to decrease throughout all models tested, while 1 mRNA (SULF1, a potential target of miR-378a-3p) exhibited the opposite trend concurrently. Among 77 ESRD (88.3% with VC) (Figure A) and 59 CKD patients (61% with VC) (Figure B), serum miR-125b2-3p and miR-378a-3p decreased with greater VC severity, while serum SULF1 levels increased. Adding serum miR-125b-2-3p, miR-378a-3p, and SULF1 into regression models for VC substantially improved performance compared to using clinical variables alone. Conclusions: Using a translational approach, we discovered a novel panel of biomarkers for gauging the probability/severity of uremic VC based on miRNAs and their target proteins, which improved the diagnostic accuracy.

U1  - Shockwave intravascular lithotripsy for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease is routinely performed via femoral artery access. In patients with complex femoropopliteal disease, this traditional approach is not feasible. To address this situation, we used an exclusive pedal access approach along with other adjunctive treatments, resulting in a successful outcome. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.)

N2  - Objectives: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a frequent condition in dialysis patients causing mineral bone disease and vascular calcification. Aim of this study was to determine pattern of treatment and healthcare costs related to SHPT in patients underwent renal replacement therapy. Methods: Administrative datasets of Lombardy Region (about 10 million inhabitants), Italy, were analysed regarding hospitalizations, diagnostic procedures, outpatient and drug prescriptions. Patients in dialysis in year 2011 and already in dialysis in the first 6 months of 2009 were selected. SHPT patients were identified through prescription of cinacalcet and/or paricalcitol and/or hospitalizations (parathyroidectomy and/or SHPT diagnosis) and observed for 4 years (2009-2012). Perspective of the analysis was that of Regional Healthcare Service (RHS). Results: 8316 patients were in RRT in 2011, of them 4791 were already in dialysis in the first 6 months of 2009 and 1793 had SHPT (37.4%, mean age 63.3 years, females 42.9%). 77% of SHPT patients were treated with cinacalcet and 52% with paricalcitol. Most frequent causes of hospitalizations were complications of renal dialysis device, implant and graft, end-stage renal disease and chronic kidney disease. Patients adherence to SHPT treatments (calculated as percentage of patients with >80% of drugs delivery/time) with cinacalcet were 48.69% while with paricalcitol were 27.99%. Mean per SHPT patient yearly cost accounted at 41,555€/year of which the 64% for dialysis, 12.3% for hospitalizations and 10.1% for drugs. Conclusions: This analysis of a large dataset confirm usefulness of real-world data for the identification of treatment patterns and costs of a chronic disease highlighting, in this case, the high costs of dialysis patients affected by SHPT and the relevant percentage of patients with sub-optimal adherence. Further investigations are needed in order to identify possible correlation between adherence and costs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The main cause of death in chronic kidney disease patients is cardiovascular death events. Increased phosphate levels in the blood in chronic kidney patients may trigger changes in the vascular, causing vascular calcification. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is a good and fairly easy noninvasive cardiovascular examination modality. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aims to determine the relationship between phosphate levels in blood with cIMT in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: This study was conducted with a cross-sectional technique in hemodialysis patients in a Mohammad Hoesin Hospital in Palembang. After the patient was tested for phosphate levels in the blood, cIMT measurements using echocardiography were carried out. Statistical tests were performed using independent t-test. RESULTS: Thirty hemodialysis patients in Mohammad Hoesin Hospital patients in Palembang, Indonesia, were examined for phosphate levels in the blood and cIMT measurements. There were 20 patients with unthickened cIMT and 10 patients with thickened cIMT (cIMT > 0.9 mm). The mean serum phosphate level in patients with unthickened cIMT was 3.5 ± 0.99 mg/dL, and the mean serum phosphate level in patients with thickened cIMT was 5.2 ± 2.3 mg/dL. There was a statistically significant relationship between serum phosphate levels with cIMT (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: There is a relationship between serum phosphate levels and cIMT in hemodialysis patients.

N2  - Introduction: Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcification of the small and medium caliber vessels of the dermis and subcutaneous cellular tissue. It is more common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, but is also described in patients with other risk factors such as secondary hyperparathyroidism, heart failure (HF), diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM-2), hypercoagulable states and drugs such as warfarin. The mortality rate is high, with sepsis being the most frequent complication. Case Report: A 57-year-old woman with a history of DM-2, HF and CKD in peritoneal dialysis was referred to Dermatology with a 1-month history of cutaneous lesions. Examination revealed nodular erythematous lesions on the posterior and lateral aspects of both lower limbs, one of them on the lower right limb, indurated and ulcerated, with a central crust. X-ray was performed showing vascular calcifications. Skin biopsy showed concentric calcification of the capillary vessels of the subcutaneous cellular tissue (SCT). Treatment with thiosulfate was initiated, peritoneal dialysis and oral anticoagulation were replaced, and cinacalcet and bisphosphonate were given for phosphocalcic metabolism adjustment with subsequent improvement in lesions. Discussion: Calciphylaxis manifests clinically as purplish and pruritic painful indurated nodules that progress to ulcers and eschars. Diagnosis is based on histological findings, which include calcification of small caliber arteries and arterioles of the dermis and SCT with subcutaneous fat necrosis. Treatment consists of sodium thiosulfate, wound care, antibiotic therapy and control of phosphocalcic metabolism with cinacalcet and bisphosphonates. It is essential to replace peritoneal dialysis with hemodialysis and to withdraw drugs such as warfarin. Nevertheless prognosis is unfavorable. This case report illustrates the importance of diagnostic suspicion in order to initiate early treatment and improve prognosis in these patients.

N2  - Calciphylaxis is a condition characterized by progressive arteriolar calcification, which results in thrombosis and necrosis of overlying skin and soft tissues. Clinically, patients present with painful, violaceous reticulate patches or plaques that progress to stellate ulcerations classically affecting the abdomen, thighs, and buttocks. Calciphylaxis typically occurs in the setting of chronic renal failure (calcific uremic arteriolopathy [CUA]); however, calciphylaxis has also been reported in patients without kidney disease (nonuremic calciphylaxis). A variety of conditions have been linked to nonuremic calciphylaxis, including primary hyperparathyroidism, connective tissue disease, corticosteroid use, alcoholic liver disease, underlying malignancy, protein C and S deficiency, and warfarin use. Herein, we present an interesting case of warfarin-associated nonuremic calciphylaxis (WANUC) to highlight its differences from CUA and warfarin-induced skin necrosis (WISN). An African American female with mild chronic kidney disease began to develop painful dusky plaques and nodules on her buttocks and thighs many months after starting warfarin for pulmonary embolism. Physical exam revealed several large stellate fibrinous ulcers on the buttocks and thighs with focal areas of eschars and few indurated, hard, exquisitely tender stellate plaques on the right lateral calf. Incisional biopsies revealed cutaneous ulceration with calcifications involving small and medium-sized vessels and fat necrosis consistent with calciphylaxis. On average, WANUC presents 32 months after warfarin initiation, a stark contrast from WISN which presents within a week or two after starting warfarin. Although the pathogenesis of this variant of nonuremic calciphylaxis is not completely understood, it is theorized that warfarin promotes vascular calcification via inhibition of the vitamin K-dependent Gla protein. Resultant thrombosis occurs via local inhibition of protein C and S, with normal systemic levels. WANUC tends to involve areas below the knee although its distribution may overlap with CUA. There is conflicting evidence regarding whether WANUC confers a lower mortality rate compared with CUA or nonuremic calciphylaxis due to other causes.

N2  - Background: The prevalence of Chronic Kidney Disease has substantially increased and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is overcoming Hypertension as underlying cause. Knowing the clinical and nutritional profile of diabetic subjects in hemodialysis treatment is essential for professionals that take care of these patients. Objectives: To describe the clinical, metabolic and nutritional features of diabetic patients and to compare them with non-diabetics patients in a hemodialysis population. Methods: A population based case-control study in 219 chronic kidney patients in hemodialysis program at the Dialysis Center of Santa Casa De Franca, São Paulo, Brazil. Data was collected from medical records. The studied variables were: albumin, ferritin, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, Parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium x phosphorus product, Total Cholesterol (CT), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, Body Mass Index (BMI), lean mass, fat mass, waist circumference (WC) and Vascular Calcification Kaupilla Score. Continue variables are expressed in mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables in frequency and percentage. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare means. Fisher and Chi Square tests were used to determine association between categorical variables. A type 1 error of 5% was assumed. Analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 7.0 program. Results: DM was the main underlying disease (37.9%) and was a comorbidity in 21.9%. Diabetic group presented higher triglycerides levels (140.4 ± 86.5 mg/dL) and higher body fat mass (31.7 ± 11.5%) than non-diabetics (113.9 ± 67.0 mg/dL; 26.2 ± 11.9%, respectively). Serum phosphorus and albumin levels were lower in diabetics (4.7 ± 1.4 mg/dL; 3.9 ± 0.5 md/dL, respectively) than in non-diabetics (5.1 ± 1.4 mg/dL; 4.1 ± 0.3 mg/dL, respectively). There was an association between DM and suppressed plasmatic PTH level ( 2ℵ = 7.9; p = 0.01). There were no differences in Kaupilla score (3.3 ± 5.3 vs. 2.6 ± 4.7) and plasmatic ferritin level (433 ± 318 vs. 455 ± 366 mg/d) between diabetics and non-diabetics patients, respectively. Conclusions: Diabetics patients in hemodialysis programs seem to present a worse nutritional status and a higher risk to have PTH level below target value. Although atherosclerosis is a known condition associated with DM, in the dialysis population vascular calcification in diabetics subjects is similar when compare with non-diabetics.

N2  - Introduction: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is significantly higher in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, with vascular calcification and atherosclerosis proving to be major contributors. Endothelial dysfunction is an early marker of atherosclerosis, triggered by oxidative stress and reduced nitric oxide production. The uremic toxin indoxyl sulphate (IS), a protein-bound non-dialyzable molecule derived from dietary tryptophan that accumulates in the blood of CKD patients, activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) promoting downstream cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) expression mediating oxidative stress and potentially endothelial dysfunction. Targeting IS-induced AhR activation in the endothelium has not previously been examined and may represent a novel approach in targeting endothelial dysfunction. Purpose: To assess the ability of the AhR antagonist, CH223191, to inhibit IS-mediated impairment of endothelial function and disruption of redox balance. Methods: To assess endothelium-dependent relaxation, the thoracic aorta from adult male Sprague Dawley rats (N=10) were used in ex vivo experiments. Rings (5mm) from the aorta were exposed to IS (300μM) in the presence and absence of the AhR antagonist CH223191 (1 and 10μM), prior to pre-constriction of the vessel with phenylephrine (30μM) followed by relaxation with acetylcholine (ACh; 1nM-30μM). Control rings were not exposed to IS or CH223191 to determine normal endothelial responses to ACh. Responses were recorded with isometric force transducers connected to a PowerLab using Chart Software. Tissue sections from these rings were stained for superoxide using dihydroethidium. To examine key AhR-mediated oxidative stress pathways, separate aortic rings were exposed to IS and CH223191, under the above conditions, for 4 hours prior to RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis. Results: IS reduced the maximum level of endothelium-dependent relaxation (Rmax) to 50.17±2.71% (P<0.001) compared to control (86.00±3.93%). In the presence of IS, CH223191 restored Rmax to 77.74±3.14% (1μM) and 81.63±3.27% (10μM) (Figure, P<0.001). The potency of ACh, known as the pEC50 (negative logarithm of the effective concentration of ACh to produce a relaxation response of 50%), in control tissues (-7.08±0.07) was increased 100-fold following exposure of IS (-5.10±0.13; P<0.001). CH223191 restored pEC50 back to control values (1μM, -6.62±0.09; 10μM, -6.83±0.08; P<0.05). IS-exposed rings increased superoxide expression (P<0.001) and CYP1A1 gene expression (P<0.001), CH223191 restored expression of both superoxide (P<0.001) and CYP1A1 (P<0.001) back to control levels. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the adverse impact of IS-mediated AhR activation on the vascular endothelium, where oxidative stress may play a critical role inducing endothelial dysfunction in the vasculature of the heart and kidneys. AhR inhibition may provide a novel therapy for CVD in the CKD setting. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: Diabetes (DM) is associated with increased risk of macro/microvascular disease and cognitive decline. Inflammation and vascular calcification may be contributing factors. Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins coordinate gene transcription and modify the transcriptional response to hyperglycemia, and inflammation. Apabetalone competitively and selectively inhibits binding between BET proteins and acetyl-lysine marks on histone tails: normalizing transcriptional profiles to physiological levels; reducing in vitro alkaline phosphatase (ALP) transcription and in vivo plasma ALP in a dose-dependent manner. Phase 2 trials with apabetalone show improved renal function in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) subgroups. Furthermore, treatment showed a 55% reduction in CVD events with more pronounced benefit among patients with DM, low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Methods: The double-blind, placebo controlled phase 3 BETonMACE trial is testing the hypothesis that apabetalone 100 mg b.i.d., added to standard care, reduces major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) in patients with DM, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within the preceding 7-90 days, low HDL-C (<40 mg/dL in men; <45 mg/dL in women), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >30 mL/min/1.7m2. The trial will continue until at least 250 MACE, providing 80% power to detect a 30% reduction. Secondary endpoints include changes in eGFR in patients with baseline eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min/1.7m2, inflammatory markers, lipids, and ALP. In addition the Montreal Cognition Assessment (MoCA) test was performed in patients ≥70 years of age at baseline and annually. Results: Enrollment of 2425 patients across 13 countries and 195 centers is now complete. Baseline characteristics [median (IQR)] include LDL-C 65.0 (36) mg/dL, HDL-C 33.0 (7) mg/dL, HbA1c 7.3 (2.3) %, hsCRP 2.8 (4.9) mg/L, mean blood pressure 129/76 mmHg, and CKD in 266 patients (10.8%). Background care was based on guideline recommendations. Diabetes medications include metformin (79%), insulin (36%), sulfonylureas (28%), DPP4 inhibitors (11%), SGLT2 inhibitors (9.7%) and GLP1 receptor agonists (0.3%). The CKD subpopulation vs. total population differed significantly from the whole population with regard to age (71 vs. 62 y. o.), male sex (58% vs. 75%), history of hypertension (46% vs. 88%), history of stroke (1.5% vs. 7.5%), and current smokers (6.1% vs. 13%). In the 70 year and older (n=466, 19%) population 54% (n=243) showed a baseline MoCA score 25 and lower suggesting cognitive impairment. Summary: The BETonMACE trial is testing the hypothesis that selective BET-inhibition with apabetalone, added to established, evidence-based treatment, reduces MACE in high-risk patients with DM, recent ACS, and low HDL-C. The study will also assess apabetalone's effect on renal function and cognition.

N2  - Background: Anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin) has recently been shown to contribute to the accelerated vascular calcification and worsening of renal function. Therefore, it is compelling to investigate the impact of different oral anticoagulants (OACs) on kidney function in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients. Common co-morbidities in these patients are chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which might be presented at the OAC therapy initiation. Purpose: The overall objective of the CALLIPER study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the reduced dose rivaroxaban (15 mg once daily) as compared to warfarin in NVAF patients with renal dysfunction in real-world setting. In particular, we evaluated the risk of worsening of renal function in NVAF patients with CKD stage 3 and 4 at baseline (1 year prior to the cohort entry). Additionally, a sub-group analysis of patients with T2DM was performed. We defined worsening of renal function as progression to CKD stage 5, kidney failure or need for dialysis. Methods: Individual level data of warfarin- and rivaroxaban-naïve NVAF patients from the MarketScan database for the years 2012 through 2017 were used. Patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (stage 3 and 4) were included in the study cohort and were followed until progression to CKD 5, kidney failure or dialysis, OAC discontinuation/switch, insurance disen-rollment or end of data availability. A comparative analysis evaluating the hazard ratios (HRs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) under warfarin or rivaroxaban treatment was performed using Cox regression. A stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for imbalances in baseline patient characteristics. Results: We identified 5,906 warfarin- and 1,466 rivaroxaban-naïve patients with NVAF and CKD stage 3 and 4, of which 60% were male, median (25-75% range) age=79 (71- 84) years, CHADS2 score=2.67 (2.00- 3.50), CHA2DS2-VASc score=4.43 (3.40-5.62), modified HAS-BLED score=3.00 (2.40 - 3.65). T2DM was present in more than 50% of patients (Table), namely, in 3,160 warfarin- and 746 rivaroxaban-users. Hazard ratios and 95% CI for worsening of renal function were evaluated at 0.53 (0.35; 0.78) in the main cohort and 0.50 (0.30; 0.83) in the T2DM sub-group, meaning that rivaroxaban was associated with a significant 47% and 50% risk reduction of this outcome in NVAF patients with CKD stage 3 and 4 with and without T2DM, respectively. Conclusion: The reduced dose of rivaroxaban has appeared to lower significantly the risk of worsening of renal function versus warfarin in NVAF patients with CKD stage 3 and 4 present at the OAC therapy initiation. The conclusion holds true for the patients with the co-morbid T2DM. This evidence was generated by the CALLIPER study using one of the largest US administrative claims database.

N2  - Question: Medial vascular calcification is an active process mediated by osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, the complex signaling pathways regulating vascular osteoinduction are still incompletely elucidated. The present study investigated the possible involvement of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) in the regulation of vascular calcification during hyperphosphatemic conditions. Methods: Experiments were performed in vitro in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs) and in vivo in cholecalciferol overload treated ASM-deficient and wild-type mice or mice treated with ASM inhibitors. Results: In vitro, bacterial sphingomyelinase up-regulated osteogenic markers MSX2, CBFA1 and ALPL mRNA expression as well as ALPL activity and augmented phosphate-induced osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation and calcification of HAoSMCs. Both, bacterial sphingomyelinase and phosphate increased ceramide levels in HAoSMCs. Addition of exogenous ceramide similarly stimulated osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation of HAoSMCs in control and high phosphate conditions. Bacterial sphingomyelinase and exogenous ceramide induced the mRNA and protein expression of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK1, while silencing of SGK1 was able to blunt bacterial sphingomyelinase- as well as ceramide-induced osteo-/chondrogenic transdifferentiation of HAoSMCs. Moreover, additional treatment with ASM inhibitors amitriptyline or fendiline suppressed phosphate-induced SGK1 mRNA expression, osteo-/chondrogenic signaling and calcification of HAoSMCs. The ASM inhibitors showed similar anti-calcific properties during uremic conditions in vitro. In vivo, cholecalciferol treatment increased Smpd1 (gene encoding ASM) mRNA expression in the aortic tissue. ASM-deficiency ameliorated aortic Sgk1 mRNA expression and osteoinduction as well as vascular calcification in mice with cholecalciferol overload. Similarly, treatment with ASM inhibitors reduced vascular calcification in the cholecalciferol overload mouse model. Conclusions: ASM stimulates osteo-chondrogenictransdifferentiation of VSMCs, at least partly, through up-regulation of SGK1-dependent signaling. Thus, ASM is a novel regulator of vascular calcification and ASM inhibition may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce the progression of vascular calcification during high phosphate conditions such as chronic kidney disease.

N2  - Background and Aims: Vascular calcification is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), independent of classical cardiovascular risk factors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis and potential treatment target of vascular calcification in CKD have not been fully defined. Methods: Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were exposed to osteogenic media with the final concentration of 2.0 mM Pi and 2.7 mM Ca. Wistar rats were fed either chow diet or high phosphate diet in the absence or presence of 0.75% adenine to induce chronic kidney disease animal model. Calcium deposition, intracellular calcium content, the mRNA and protein expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and specific markers of TGF-β pathways in HASMC or aortas were measured. Results: The present results showed that osteogenic medium-induced HASMC calcification existed inflammatory response and increased proinflammatory cytokines expression and vascular calcification were in rats with CKD; TGF-β pathway was involved in vascular calcification and inflammation; Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) activation reduced vascular inflammation and calcification under high phosphate condition through inhibiting the expression of TGFBR1/2 and TAK1. Conclusions: The present study suggests that FXR activation reduces TGF-β-mediated vascular inflammation and calcification via inhibiting the expression of TGFBR1/2 and TAK1. Our study represents a novel potential target for vascular calcification in patients with CKD.

N2  - Introduction: Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that is difficult to diagnose in the absence of biopsy-proven non-caseating granulomas. We report a rare case of sarcoidosis-associated hypercalcemia and calciphylaxis in a patient on hemodialysis (HD) with left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Case: A 53-year-old man with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, poorly controlled diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) presented with decompensated heart failure and ventricular tachycardia. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) of the heart suggested myocardial inflammation and sarcoidosis. He developed cardiogenic shock despite steroids and received an LVAD. Apical core biopsy showed normal myocardium. His CKD progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring HD six months later. He developed bilateral lower extremity pain thought to be diabetic neuropathy. He had hypercalcemia with normal parathyroid and thyroid hormones, but high angiotensin-converting enzyme level. Whole body PET-CT showed increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the spleen, liver, and small lung nodules. Biopsy of supraclavicular node with increased FDG uptake was negative for granulomas or malignancy. Serum protein electrophoresis did not yield monoclonal protein, and bone marrow biopsy showed no lymphoma. Bilateral calves and glans penis developed painful plaques with sharp borders and thick eschar (Figure A). Punch biopsy showed vascular calcifications in subcutaneous tissue, consistent with calciphylaxis (Figure B-D). Sodium thiosulfate was started with resultant shrinkage of lesions. Hypercalcemia resolved with prednisone and hydroxychloroquine. Unfortunately, the patient developed sepsis from the skin lesions and suffered a hemorrhagic stroke. His family decided to withdraw care. Discussion: In this case, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made based on indirect evidence, and supported by resolution of hypercalcemia with prednisone. Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis stems from calcitriol overproduction by monocytes, leading to increased intestinal calcium absorption. High calcium and phosphate levels, often found in patients with ESRD, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis. For his LVAD, the patient was on warfarin, a known risk factor for calciphylaxis. Previous studies reported < 1 year survival for patients with calciphylaxis. Clinicians should be vigilant in diagnosing calciphylaxis early in patients with multiple risk factors: ESRD on HD, warfarin use, hypercalcemia, and sarcoidosis.

N2  - Objectives: Vascular calcification is accelerated and worsened in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis patients compared to the general population. Misbalanced phosphate and calcium metabolism plays an important role in this health burden in CKD. In this study the role of phosphate and calcium in inducing medial vascular calcification is researched. Methods: Rat aortic rings were incubated in the normal and calcifying mediums for seven days. Three independent experiments, three rings per condition in each, were performed (N=9). Normal medium consisted of DMEM with 0.9 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium. Calcium medium (Ca) consisted of 4.0 mM calcium and 0.9 mM phosphate; phosphate medium (P) of 2.8 mM phosphate and 1.8 mM calcium; and calciumphosphate medium (Ca+P) of 4.0 mM calcium and 2.8 mM phosphate. Histochemical von Kossa staining was performed, and calcification area of a medial and adventitial section of the aorta was calculated. The results were compared using a two-way ANOVA test. Results: Von Kossa stainings and evaluations of the calcified area demonstrated increased calcification in aortic rings incubated in different calcification mediums, whereas the calcification takes part in different sections of the aorta. Calcium alone causes calcification in the adventitia, phosphate alone in the medial section of the aorta. Combination of both leads to extensive calcification in the adventitia and media. Discussion: In dialysis patients, serum calcium levels are maintained quite well, but serum phosphate levels may exceed suggested levels multiple times. The results of the study demonstrate that high phosphate level is the trigger of excessive vascular calcification and the control of levels of phosphate in CKD patients is crucially important.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Cinacalcet cessation on biomarkers of bone metabolism(Calcium, Phosphate, Parathyroid hormone, Alkaline Phosphotase) and rates of Parathyroidectomies in Top End Health service (TEHS) of Northern Territory. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a complication in Chronic Kidney Disease which develops as a result of impaired calcium homeostasis in renal failure leading to changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels. Hyperparathyroidism is associated with bone pain, fractures, vascular calcification and increased cardiovascular risk. Cinacalcet is an oral calcimimetic, which has been used in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism, leading to improved PTH and serum calcium levels. According to EVOLVE study, cinacalcet did not improve cardiovascular mortality, leading to withdrawal of cinacalcet from the pharmaceutical benefit scheme (PBS) in August 2015 in Australia, ceasing access to it. Whilst vitamin D and its analogues are being increasingly used instead of cinacalcet, parathyroidectomy became the only definitive treatment option available for many patients. Northern Territory of Australia has limited access to parathyroid surgical expertise, potentially leading to lower rates of parathyroidectomies performed compared to rest of the Australia. We report the impact of withdrawal of cinacalcet from PBS on bone biomarkers and rates of parathyroidectomies in the local, predominantly indigenous, dialysis patient population. Methods: Ethics approval obtained, electronic patient records were accessed and data collected retrospectively. Total of (n=43) patients were on Cinacalcet before August 2015 and 19 Parathyroidectomies were performed at Royal Darwin Hospital between 2012 and 2018. We conducted standard t-test to analyse the difference in serum Calcium levels and ALP levels pre and post cessation of cinacalcet. We also conducted Two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test to assess the difference in PTH and Serum Phosphate levels. Results: The number of Parathyroidectomies doubled post cessation of Cinacalcet. The PTH levels were 130 pmol/l (56.4 – 167.6 pmol/l) whilst on cinacalcet which increased to 195.2 pmol/l (125.1–259.1) after cessation of cinacalcet (figure 1). The Calcium levels increased from 2.27 mmol/l to 2.34 mmol/l (figure 2). The ALP levels increased from 238.9 IU/L (172.4 – 277.4) to 276.4 IU/L (227.2 – 313.8) (figure 3). Interestingly, the phosphate levels decreased from 1.69 mmol/l (1.28 – 2.1) to 1.32 mmol/l (0.96 – 1.78). (figure 4) [Figure presented] Conclusions: Therapy with calcitriol/vitamin D analogues is not sufficient for control of biochemical parameters in the setting of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Cinacalcet cessation led to increase in the number of parathyroidectomies. Parathyroidectomy is a complex surgery in dialysis patients which needs significant resources to coordinate the surgery and requires close monitoring post-operatively. It is even more complicated in Northern Territory given the remote location of the patients and limited availability of resources for follow-up. We need further analysis into risk of fractures from secondary hyperparathyroidism in association with Cinacalcet cessation and cost analysis to postulate the advantage. Limitations – We did not investigate effect of Calcitriol doses, Surgical complications, fractures and mortality.

N2  - Introduction: Calcium and phosphate are present in serum at concentrations that should encourage precipitation, but ectopic mineral deposition outside of osseous tissue is rarely seen in children outside disease states. However, in ageing and some pathologies e.g. chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammatory disease and in diabetes, extra-osseous mineral deposition is common. For many years a high serum phosphate level has been considered one of the prime drivers to this event, yet evidence that modifying phosphate levels affects calcification is lacking. Neonates have high serum phosphate concentrations which are in the range that is considered to be poorly controlled in adults on dialysis. Most neonates should therefore theoretically have high levels of placental and vascular calcification. Fetuin proteins form nanoparticle aggregates that keep calcium and phosphate in solution and we hypothesised that neonates may have large numbers of circulating calciprotein particles. Methods: 10ml of venous umbilical cord blood was collected at at elective caesarean sections of healthy term mothers at the Royal Women’s Hospital. CPP were measured by flow cytometry as described by Smith et al Results: All cord samples showed detectable CPP, and almost all of these were at higher concentrations than the normal adult population. The mean CPP level was 184x105 particles/ml. The median CPP level was 73x105 particles/ml. Two samples were found to have exceptionally high levels of CPP. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated, for the first time, that CPPs are present in umbilical cord blood, and that they are present at levels higher than in normal adults. High CPP levels may have a role in preventing abnormal calcification in neonates and are likely physiological.

N2  - Introduction: Vascular calcification is one of the strong risk factors for cardiovascular events and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are known to be accumulated in diabetes and/or CKD patients and contributing to the development of vascular complications such as the arteriosclerosis and vascular calcification. However, the mechanisms why and how AGEs are increased in patients with hemodialysis (HD) and its precise roles on the development of vascular calcification are remained to be elucidated. Methods: To address this issue, we investigate the relationship among the serum levels of AGEs and metabolic factors in 37 chronic HD patients in our hospital. We also evaluated the relationship between these factors and vascular calcification assessed by Agaston score and abdominal aorta calcification score (ACI) in the abdominal CT. Results: AGEs levels are significantly increased in these patients. Age, diabetes, blood pressure and HD periods were not associated with AGEs levels in our subjects, while GNRI was tended to correlated with AGEs levels in our subjects. In cross-sectional study, vascular calcification was significantly related to Age, ABI, and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels, but not AGEs levels in our subjects. In retrospective study, annual changing rates for vascular calcification were significantly increased and associated with TG, Hs-CRP and IL-6 levels in our subjects. Conclusions: These observations suggest that malnutrition could be a determinant for AGEs levels in chronic HD patients. Moreover, TG, Hs-CRP and IL-6 were associated with the development of vascular calcification, while there was no correlation between AGEs and vascular calcification in our subjects. Chronic inflammation, but not AGEs, is involved in the development of vascular calcification in HD patients. Further large scaled study should be needed to elucidate the association among AGE, nutrition status, inflammation, and vascular calcification.

N2  - Purpose: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is forecast to become the fifth leading cause of death globally by 2040. Retinal microvascular changes resulting from systemic vascular remodeling have been reported in association with CKD and may improve stratification of risk. We assessed associations between retinal microvascular parameters and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). Methods: A case-control study was undertaken in a subset of the UK Biobank (UKBB) population. Cases had an ACR ≥ 3mg/mmol, controls had an ACR < 3mg/mmol and were matched for age, gender and ethnicity. Macula centered fundus images were analyzed using the semi-automated software Vessel Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the REtina (VAMPIRE). Logistic regression models were constructed to assess associations between retinal microvascular parameters and ACR status. Fully adjusted models included age, gender, ethnicity, systolic blood pressure, diagnosis of diabetes, smoking status and fellow vessel caliber for models including arteriolar and venular caliber. Results: In this interim analysis of 930 participants (453 cases, 477 controls), the mean age was 58 years (standard deviation [SD] 8) for cases and 59 (SD 8) for controls; 57% of cases and 53% of controls were female. Diabetes was present in 18% of cases and 9% of controls. In models adjusted for confounding variables, higher fractal dimension (FD) was significantly associated with reduced risk of albuminuria for both arterioles (odds ratio [OR] 0.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01, 0.38) and venules (OR 0.05, CI <0.01, 0.44). Retinal microvascular caliber and tortuosity were not significantly associated with albuminuria. Conclusions: Higher FDs (denser retinal arteriolar and venular branching patterns) are associated with reduced cross-sectional risk of albuminuria in the subset of the UKBB population considered. Given the metabolic demands and hemodynamic principles governing vascular branching, altered retinal microvascular FDs may reflect metabolic disturbances and vascular calcification in CKD.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis patients are showing extended and accelerated vascular calcification compared to the general population whereas misbalanced phosphate calcium metabolism plays an important role. In this study, we demonstrate that calcium and phosphate induce calcification in different parts of the aorta. METHODS: Rat aortic rings were incubated in the normal and calcifying mediums for seven days. Three independent experiments, three rings per condition in each, were performed (N=9). Normal medium consisted of DMEM with 0.9mMphosphate and 1.8mMcalcium. Calcium medium(Ca) consisted of 4.0mMcalcium and 0.9mMphosphate; phosphate medium(P) 2.8mMphosphate and 1.8mMcalcium; and calciumphosphate medium(Ca+P) 4.0mMcalcium and 2.8mMphosphate. Histochemical von Kossa staining was performed, and calcification area of a medial and adventitial section of the aorta was calculated. The results were compared using two way ANOVA test. RESULTS: Von Kossa stainings and evaluations of the calcified area demonstrated increased calcification in aortic rings incubated in different calcification mediums (Fig. 1 and 2), whereas the calcification takes part in different sections of the aorta. Calcium alone causes calcification in the adventitia, phosphate alone in the medial section of the aorta. Combination of both leads to extensive calcification in the adventitia and media. CONCLUSIONS: In dialysis patients, serum calcium levels are maintained quite good, but serum phosphate levels may exceed suggested levels multiple times. The results of the study demonstrate that high phosphate level is the trigger of excessive vascular calcification and the control of levels of phosphate in CKD patients is crucially important.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Inorganic phosphate and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) are known to have a major impact in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the therewith associated mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD). They are also involved in the development of vascular calcification and left ventricular hypertrophy. Both parameters associate with adverse outcomes in CKD, chronic heart failure, but also in the general population. While numerous promotors and inhibitors of vascular calcification have been described, the contribution and clinical significance of these individual components to the overall propensity for calcification of serum remains elusive. A new, functional test is able to measure the propensity for calcification of serum (T50-test). Low T50 values have been associated with cardiovascular events and risk of death in patients with chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis patients as well as renal transplant recipients. So far, there is no information on the relationship between the propensity of serum for calcification and patient-level outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure. The aim of this study was to assess the relevance of the T50-test in this patient population. METHODS: We measured the T50 values in a cohort of 304 patients with chronic heart failure who were recruited at the outpatient department for heart failure at the Medical University of Vienna. The results were correlated to all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 3,5 years, 113 patients (37%) died due to any cause, and 76 patients (25%) died of cardiovascular events. One hundred and thirtyeight patients (45%) had ischemic and 166 patients (55%) had non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMP). Overall, the patients had a slightly reduced kidney function with a mean eGFR of 79ml/min/1,73m2 (SD:±14). The mean T50 values were 283min (SD:±97). In the lowest T50-tertile, we observed a significantly lower short-term survival (after 2 years) in the log rank analysis (p=0.032). This was not the case in a longer follow-up of 5 years. When looking into the etiology of CMP, we found that low T50 values correlated with the 2-year all-cause mortality in patients with ischemic CMP (p=0.036) but not in patients with non-ischemic CMP. There was also a significant association between low T50 values and the 2-year cardiovascular mortality in patients with ischemic CMP (p=0.004) but this was not observed in the overall cohort. This finding was confirmed in a Cox regression analysis (p=0.041). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic heart failure, T50 was able to predict shortterm cardiovascular mortality in patients with ischemic CMP, which was not the case in patients with non-ischemic CMP indicating a stronger relationship between T50 and vascular calcification.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Despite being integral to homeostasis, the circadian rhythms of calcium, phosphate, and their hormonal regulators (PTH, FGF-23) are not well characterized. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) disrupts mineral homeostasis and causes pathologies like vascular calcification (VC). This study sought to examine the effects of CKD and VC on mineral/hormonal circadian rhythm. METHODS: High-adenine diet (0.25%) was used to induce CKD in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=13). After 5weeks animals were switched to control diet (0.5%-phosphate) for 1week, then switched to high-phosphate (1.0%-phosphate) for 1week. A parallel control group (n=7) was fed 0.5% phosphate for 6weeks then switched to high-phosphate for 1week. 3days later, animals were anesthetized, infused with radiolabeled phosphate, had blood samples collected over 30minutes, and were euthanized. Prior to CKD induction, all animals had 24hour assessment with blood sampling every 3hours. Similar assessments were conducted after 1week 0.5%-phosphate diet and 1week 1.0%-phosphate diet. RESULTS: Distinct circadian patterning was observed in phosphate (p<0.0001), FGF- 23 and PTH (p<0.05) at baseline; calcium did not show circadian variation. CKD did not alter the patterns observed at baseline. 1week of 1.0%phosphate diet in CKD led to loss of circadian rhythmicity in phosphate and FGF-23; as well as VC in 62% of CKD animals. CKD and VC led to a predisposition for radiolabeled phosphate to influx into vasculature and bone, where in controls it influxes into kidneys. Adjusting for VC, CKD rats without VC displayed phosphate circadian variation (p<0.01) whereas CKD rats with VC did not. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first experimental examination of circadian variation in CKD. This study found (i) CKD does not impact circadian variation in phosphate, PTH, or FGF23, (ii) that VC in CKD removes phosphate circadian rhythmicity, and (iii) that hyperphosphatemia in CKD removes FGF-23 circadian rhythm.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Disordered bone and mineral metabolism is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Phosphate binders are often prescribed in advanced CKD, when hyperphosphatemia develops. Little is known about the benefits and safety of such drugs in earlier CKD stages, when serum phosphorus levels are still in the normal range at the expense of increasing urinary fractional excretion of phosphate. METHODS: A retrospective, controlled observational study was conducted on a cohort of 78 predialysis patients. Subjects had CKD stage 3 or 4, normal serum phosphorus levels and increased urinary fractional excretion of phosphate. Subjects had no previous exposure to calcium salts or vitamin D agents. Thirty-eight patients receiving calcium carbonate for 24 months were compared with 40 patients under no phosphate binders, regarding mineral metabolism parameters and vascular calcification scores. RESULTS: Calcium carbonate decreased mean fractional excretion of phosphate and median 24-hour urine phosphorus (P<0.001 for both), with no significant change seen in the control group. Mean serum phosphorus and median serum intact parathyroid hormone remained stable in the treatment group, but increased in the control group (P=0.001 for both). Kauppila and Adragão calcification scores increased under calcium carbonate (P<0.001 for both), but did not change significantly in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with calcium carbonate reduced urinary phosphate excretion and prevented the rise in phosphorus and intact parathyroid hormone serum levels in a cohort of normophosphatemic predialysis patients. However, treatment was associated with increased vascular calcification, suggesting that calcium-based phosphate binders are not a safe option for CKD patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular calcification (VC) is a common complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and has been shown to be associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality. However, the mechanisms of CKD VC and how VC contributes to high mortality risk have not been well recognized. This study was to explore the role of Wnt-signaling pathway in CKD VC, and the association between VC and blood pressure variability (BPV) which is a risk factor of cardiovascular events. METHODS: In this study, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into adenineinduced CKD group (n=5) and control group (n=5). Low-calcium and highphosphate diets were introduced to induce vascular calcification. Both daytime (hourto- hour during the day) and mid-term (day-to-day for 9 days) blood pressure (BP) were collected and analyzed for BPV metrics. At sacrifice, kidney, heart and aorta samples were taken for histological analyses. Calcium deposition in aorta was identified with Alizarin Red stain and graded. Immunohistochemistry stain was performed with antibodies against Wnt3a, Wnt5a, β-catenin, sclerostin, osteopontin and α-SMA. RESULTS: Compared with control rats, CKD rats suffered from markedly severer VC (Grade 2.6±0.2 vs 0.0±0.0, p=0.0046, Fig A&B). The calcification deposition sites were mostly at the medial layer. VC was positively correlated with vascular Wnt3a and bcatenin expression (p= p=0.0090 and 0.0000), but not significantly associated with Wnta5a or sclerostin. There was no significant difference in BP between two groups at baseline. During follow-up, CKD group gained significantly higher systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) than the control group (168±24 vs. 102±15, p=0.0000; 90±34 vs. 68±19, p=0.0008). CKD group showed more violent BP fluctuation than control (Fig C&D). Daytime SBP and DBP standard deviation (SD) in CKD group were significantly higher than that in control group (21±5 vs. 12±5, p=0.0000; 27±9 vs. 16±5, p=0.0000), as well as mid-term SBP and DBP SD (22±5 vs. 12±5, p=0.0000; 22±10 vs. 15±4, p=0.0004). Aorta calcification grade was positively correlated with both daytime (r=0.6963, p=0.0251) and mid-term SBP variability (r=0.6829, p=0.0295). Fig legend. A. No vascular calcification in control group (Alizarin Red stain×100). B Vascular calcification in CKD group (Alizarin Red stain×100). C. Mid-term blood pressure variability. D. Daytime blood pressure variability. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we confirmed that CKD rats had enhanced Wntsignaling in vascular tissue and severer aorta calcification together with increased BPV. Wnt pathway may be a potential target in future VC and BPV management in CKD. (Figure Presented).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is an osteocytic phosphaturic hormone known to increase renal phosphorus excretion and reduce calcitriol synthesis via the alpha-klotho obligate co-receptor. FGF23 has been identified as an independent marker for cardiovascular (CV) risk in various patient populations, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has linked elevated levels of FGF23 to mortality, leftventricular dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular and endothelial dysfunction, and progression of CKD. Apabetalone is a first-in-class orally active bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor associated with the reduction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in phase II clinical trials, now undergoing confirmatory phase III testing (BETonMACE trial). Apabetalone has previously been shown to downregulate markers of atherosclerosis, vascular calcification, and vascular inflammation. Here we demonstrate the effects of apabetalone on FGF23 in high risk patient populations, especially CKD. METHODS: In the phase II clinical studies, ASSERT & ASSURE, high risk CVD patients were treated with 100 mg b.i.d. apabetalone vs. placebo. In a phase I renal impairment study, CS-016, stage 4/5 CKD patients not on dialysis were matched with control subjects without renal impairment, both groups receiving a single 100 mg oral dose of apabetalone. Plasma samples were collected from patients for proteomic analysis using the SOMAScan™ 1. 3K platform to assess relative fluorescent units (RFUs) of1∼,300 analytes. Changes in protein levels were measured following 12 weeks (ASSERT) and 26 weeks (ASSURE) of treatment, and at 12 hours post dose in CS-016. RESULTS: In the ASSURE trial, patients treated with apabetalone (n=47) saw a greater reduction of serum FGF23 (median change and percent change relative to baseline) of - 17.3 RFUs, -3.7% vs. placebo patients (n=47), -8.6 RFUs, -1.7%(ANCOVA p-values vs. placebo: change = 0.01; percent change = 0.02). In patients that had baseline FGF23 levels greater than the median value, those that were treated with apabetalone (n=23) demonstrated an even greater reduction of FGF23 vs. placebo (n=23): -82.5 RFUs and - 12.5% vs. -15.5 RFUs and -3.0% (ANCOVA p-value vs. placebo: change = 0.05; percent change = 0.1). CKD patients from both ASSERT and ASSURE trials treated with apabetalone (n=5) showed a decrease in levels of FGF23 (-31.1 RFUs, -6.6%) vs. placebo (n=5), who saw an increase (+264.2 RFUs, +49.3%) (Mann-Whitney p-value vs. placebo = 0.06 for both change and percent change). In the renal impairment study CS-016, stage 4/5 CKD patients treated apabetalone (n=8) showed a significant reduction in median serum FGF23 at 12 hours (-151.7 RFUs, -18.4%) vs. matched controls treated with apabetalone (n=8) (-24.6 RFUs, -5.8%) (ANCOVA p-value CKD patients vs. matched controls: change = 0.08; percent change = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In CVD and renally impaired CKD patients, BET inhibition and apabetalone demonstrates consistent reduction of circulating FGF23, a marker of CV risk and progression of CKD. This effect appears to be more pronounced in patients that are at higher risk, including those with elevated levels of FGF23 above the median baseline level, and patients with CKD. The potential impact of chronic treatment with apabetalone on biomarkers, renal function, and CVD outcomes is currently being evaluated in the phase III BETonMACE CVD outcomes trial.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Apabetalone is an orally active inhibitor of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins-epigenetic readers modulating gene expression by bridging acetylated histones or transcription factors with transcriptional machinery. In phase 2 clinical trials, apabetalone reduced major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), resulting in 44% relative risk reduction on top of standard of care. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequently accompanied by cardiovascular complications, which remain resistant to current therapies. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) contributes to vascular calcification (VC) and endothelial dysfunction. Accordingly, serum ALP is emerging as an independent and novel predictor of MACE and of all-cause mortality. METHODS: Serum ALP levels were examined post-hoc in CVD patients receiving apabetalone in the 3 month (ASSERT) and 6 month (SUSTAIN & ASSURE) phase 2 trials, including a subset with impaired renal function (eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73m2). Effects of BET inhibitors (BETi) on expression of tissue-nonspecific ALP (TNAP; gene symbol ALPL) was determined in cultured primary human hepatocytes (PHH), the HepaRG cell line, primary human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) during transdifferentiation to calcifying cells, and vascular endothelial cells. ALP enzyme activity was measured in enzymatic assays. RESULTS: In phase 2 trials, baseline serum ALP independently predicted MACE (hazard ratio [HR] per SD 1.6,95% CI 1.2-2.2, p=0.001). In ASSERT, apabetalone dose dependently reduced serum ALP (n=74-76/group; p<0.001 median change vs. placebo). Patients in phase 2 on apabetalone (n=553) had greater reductions in ALP than placebo (n=242; p<0.001). ALP reduction by apabetalone was associated with reduction in MACE (HR 0.58 per SD, 95% CI 0.44-0.77, p<0.001). In the subgroup with eGFR<60, patients on apabetalone (n=69) also had lower on-treatment serum ALP (p=0.008) vs. placebo (n=22). Liver-derived TNAP accounts for x 5 0% of ALP enzyme activity in serum. In PHH & HepaRG cells, apabetalone suppressed ALPL expression by 60-80%. Vascular expression of ALPL also contributes to VC & cardiovascular risk Compared to basal conditions, trans-differentiation of VSMCs to calcifying cells resulted in 2.5x increase in ALPL expression. Apabetalone or JQ1 (BETi with different chemical scaffolds) countered extracellular calcium deposition and suppressed ALPL gene expression, TNAP protein levels, and enzyme activity. Apabetalone downregulated ALPL expression in human aortic endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and brain microvascular endothelial cells by 50-70%. CONCLUSIONS: Apabetalone dose dependently lowers serum ALP in patients, which is associated with reduction in cardiovascular events. Decreased ALPL expression in cultured hepatocytes with apabetalone is consistent with reduced serum ALP in patients. In addition, apabetalone downregulates ALPL expression in vascular cell types including VSMCs and endothelial cells, while reducing VSMC calcification. Involvement of BET proteins in VSMC calcification is a novel discovery. Our data indicate apabetalone has potential to decrease progression of pathological VC and contribute to positive cardiovascular outcomes in CVD patients. The impact of apabetalone treatment on biomarkers, renal function, and CVD outcomes is being evaluated in the phase 3 BETonMACE trial (NCT02586155).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The control of phosphatemia is one of the cornerstones in the prevention of cardiovascular complications in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in hemodialysis (HD). To do this, in addition to controlling the diet and the dialysis therapy itself, several phosphate binding (PB) drugs are available. Nowadays, very effective formulations regarding the binding of dietary phosphorus are available. However, this binding is not selective and, a decrease in serum levels of essential substances such as folic acid and fat-soluble vitamins has been notified. On the other hand, the role of vitamin k in preventing vascular calcification has been proposed, based on its role in activating matrix Gla protein (MGP), a calcification inhibitor that is expressed in vascular tissue. Therefore, the benefits of phosphorous control could be limited by the involuntary loss of other substances. The aim of this study is to compare the effect on fat-soluble vitamins and vitamin Kmodified proteins. METHODS: METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the data of 27 patients in our hemodialysis unit from December 2017 and January-2019. We used the blood samples that are routinely stored in our biobank. All patients had previously signed an informed consent. Among the patients of whom blood sample was stored in our biobank, we included patients aged above 18 years old, on stable hemodialysis treatment, diagnosed with CKD-MBD and treated with the same PB during at least 3 months, and that had been swifted to another PB. We compared uc-dp MGP, PIVKA, Vitamin D, Osteocalcin, Phosphate, PTH in the stored blood samples before and after the PB change. Each patient was contr RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in uc-dp MGP levels and PIVKA in patients taking sevelamer compared to patients taking calcium binders or sucroferric oxyhidroxide. CONCLUSIONS: Sevelamer reduces vitamin K derived proteins such as uc-dp MGP , presumably by intestinal loss . This may play a negative role in preventing vascular calcification.

N2  - Learning Objective #1: Recognize the clinical features of ecthyma gangrenosum and calciphylaxis Learning Objective #2: Manage ulcers due to calciphylaxis CASE: An 89 year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma (MM) not on therapy, chronic kidney disease stage IV, and diabetes presented to the emergency room with confusion and left lower extremity allodynia. Home medications included cholecalciferol, patiromer, and nephrovite. Physical exam was notable for temperature of 38° C, suprapubic tenderness, and left lower extremity edema, allodynia, and an inability to bear weight. Labs demonstrated creatinine 3.08 mg/dL (near baseline), white blood cell count 50.0 k/uL, and normal calcium, phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Urinalysis was significant for > 100 white blood cells cells/μ l and leg X-rays were unremarkable. Urine cultures grew resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae which was treated with 5 days of ertapenem. On hospital day 7, the patient developed a 12x6cm stellate-shaped purpuric plaque with an overlying tense bulla over the medial ankle. Pathology from two punch biopsies was consistent with ecthyma gangrenosum and Klebsiella pneumonia grew on wound cultures. Ertapenem was continued, but the ulcer developed central necrosis with undefined borders and persistent allodynia. A CT of the leg showed extensive subcutaneous edema with vascular calcifications. Given lack of clinical improvement and progressive necrosis, a repeat biopsy was performed on hospital day 12, which noted vessel thrombosis and calcification consistent with calciphylaxis. The patient was started on biweekly sodium thiosulfate and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Cutaneous necrosis is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, necessitating early recognition and diagnosis. Among the various etiologies are ecthyma gangrenosum and calciphylaxis. Ecthyma gangrenosum, typically associated with Pseudo-monas infections in immunocompromised bacteremic patients, has been increasingly reported in association with E. coli and Klebsiella in the absence of bacteremia. As in this case, it can predispose to calcipylaxis in at-risk patients. Calciphylaxis typically develops in patients with advanced renal disease, hyperparathyroidism and elevated calcium-phosphate product. It has also been reported in patients with MM due to an acquired protein S deficiency. Treatment is typically multimodal and includes sodium thiosulfate, which is associated with clinical improvement but lacks conclusive evidence demonstrating efficacy, treatment of hyperphosphatemia, and wound care. Hyperbaric oxygen has been used as an adjunctive therapy to facilitate wound healing. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge with a necrotic ulcer, and cautions against premature diagnostic closure. Conclusion: The differential for acute cutaneous necrosis includes ecthyma gangrenosum and calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis has been described in patients with MM due to an acquired hypercoagulability state. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy improves healing and morbidity in calciphylaxis.

N2  - Objective: Vascular calcification is a critical health concern in patients with diabetes and kidney dysfunction. Since vascular calcification is linked to systemic mineral imbalance such as hyperphosphatemia, lowering serum phosphorus concentrations with nutritional therapy and administration of oral phosphate binders has been a major therapy for preventing vascular calcification. However, a decrease in serum phosphorus concentrations alone does not completely suppress vascular calcification. To determine a mode of enhanced suppression of vascular calcification, we examined whether, an anti-diabetic drug, canagliflogin (Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: SGLT2 inhibitors), inhibited progressive kidney injury and vascular calcification. Methods and Results: At 9 weeks of age, diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (STZ), and one week later CKD was induced by removal of the left kidney. One week after the surgery, rats were fed a high phosphate diet (2.0% wt/wt)) and intraperitoneal administration of paricalcitol (3x a week), and were administered 10 mg/kg/day either canagliflogin or vehicle for a duration of 2 weeks. At termination, blood and urine were collected, and renal and thoraco-abdominal aortas were dissected. Plasma concentrations of urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cre), calcium, and phosphate were measured. Immunostaining was performed to evaluate kidney injury. Vascular calcification in aortas was evaluated by Von Kossa and Alizarin Red S staining, and measurement of calcium content. STZ induced diabetes and nephrectomy that provoked kidney damage with renal tubular injury, renal-enlargement, and vascular calcification in aortas. Inhibition of SGLT2 by canagliflozin suppressed renal tubular injury, renal-enlargement, and vascular calcification. Conclusions: Our results support that selective inhibition of SGLT2 receptor improved the progression of kidney injury and reduced vascular calcification in diabetic and chronic kidney disease related conditions.

N2  - Background: coronary vascular calcification (CVC) is a known predictor of worse clinical outcomes after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). Molecules associated with Wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway such as Sclerostin have been implicated in CVC. We tested the hypothesis that DKK-1 (soluble competitive inhibitor of Wnt-molecules) can predict CVC and clinical outcomes in CAD patients Methods: A prospective cohort of 179 CAD patients was enrolled and DKK1 was measured using ELISA in peripheral blood. Follow up period is one year for MACE. Results: Among 179 patients (30 non-obstructive CAD[nobCAD], 50 with obstructive CAD[oCAD]), CVC was found in 56 (31%) patients–20% in nobCAD group and 33% in oCAD group. The mean DKK1 in the entire cohort was 738±1925 pg/mL (See Figure). Higher DKK1 levels (>362pg/dL) were associated with CVC (p=0.04), a predictor of MACE. Overall, 24(13% reached MACE endpoint. The univariate predictors of MACE were: Age, CKD, GFR, CVC, DKK1, and DM. In multivariate regression model (Figure), DKK1 (OR: 6.1; p=0.008) was an independent predictor of MACE in addition to age (1.07, p-0.01), diabetes (5.8, p0.003), GFR (0.95, p0.02) but not VC (1.47, p=0.4) Conclusion: DKK1 is a significant predictor of CVC and is associated with MACE in post PCI and non-obstructive CAD. DKK1 is a potential driver of accelerated vascular calcification and is an interesting potential therapeutic target to be studied in clinical conditions associated with VC such as chronic kidney disease.

N2  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, and the cardiovascular risk increases with the severity of renal failure. Premature vascular aging in CKD patients is believed to drive the cardiovascular complications. We hypothesized that peripheral vascular dysfunction in CKD patients is accompanied by a uremia induced senescence phenotype, including the presence of calcification. Methods: During living-donor renal transplantation, subcutaneous fat biopsies were obtained from the abdominal wall at the incision site from donors (n = 36) and recipients (n = 40) for isolation of resistance-sized arteries to assess endothelial and smooth muscle function using wire myography. In vivo, reactive hyperemia index (RHI) was measured to assess endothelial function with the EndoPAT. Isolated arteries were also collected to detect senescence signature markers P16 and P21, RUNX2 (calcification), sirtuin 1 (endothelial function) and sclerostin (structure) within the artery wall. Additionally, the number of biochemical markers (proinflammatory, remodeling milieu, including signs of stress-related damage in addition to clinical characteristics) were collected to test for possible correlations of interest. Results: The selected groups (CKD patients and donor controls) for the study were similar in age, sex and in respect to other parameters measured, except those related to symptoms of the disease presentation, medications and biochemical characteristics related to the renal failure. There was no difference in vascular function assessed by EndoPAT between patients and controls (RHI; 2.3 ± 0.1, n = 37 vs 2.4 ± 0.1, n = 32), however ex vivo investigations of vascular function revealed a significant difference in the contribution of endothelium-derived factors conferring the endothelium- dependent dilatation (e.g. nitric oxide contribution: CKD group 7.37%± 3.05 vs controls 18.37 ± 2.08; p = 0.03). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between in vivo RHI and ex vivo measurements of endothelial function (r = 0.4; p = 0.02) in the studied subjects (n = 34). A higher expression of senescence and calcification markers such as P16, P21, RUNX2, and reduced expression of sirtuin1 was seen in CKD patients (n = 40) versus controls (n = 36), while there was no difference in expression of sclerostin. Further studies are ongoing to assess if correlations are present between functional parameters, markers of vascular calcification and senescence, with circulating biochemical markers of interest. Conclusions: The uremic environment has an effect on vascular function by changing the contribution of endothelium-derived factors in patients undergoing renal transplantation. Moreover, the vasculature from CKD patients is characterized by the presence of a senescence signature which might confer the development of cardiovascular complications in this specific patient group.

N2  - Introduction: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and vascular calcification is one pathway by which risk is increased. Hypothesis: We assessed the hypothesis that a novel measure of serum calcification propensity is associated with CVD events among patients with CKD stages 2-4. Methods: Among 3397 participants from the prospective longitudinal Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study, calcification propensity was quantified at baseline as the transformation time (T50) from primary to secondary calciprotein particles, with lower T50 corresponding to higher calcification propensity. CVD events are reported every six months and confirmed by medical record adjudication. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by study site, were used to assess the associations of T50 with risks of atherosclerotic CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral artery disease) and congestive heart failure (CHF) events. Results: Over an average 7.1-year follow-up, we observed 571 atherosclerotic CVD events (312 myocardial infarction, 120 stroke, and 139 peripheral artery disease events) and 633 CHF events. The mean (standard deviation) T50 was 313.4 (79.1) minutes. After adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors, lower T50 was significantly associated with higher risk of atherosclerotic CVD, but not with risk of CHF. The addition of T50 modestly improved atherosclerotic CVD event discrimination beyond ACC/AHA atherosclerotic CVD risk score variables (c-statistic 0.713 vs. 0.710; p<0.001). Adjustment for kidney function attenuated the association between T50 and CVD events (Table). Conclusions: Among patients with CKD stages 2-4, higher serum calcification propensity is significantly associated with atherosclerotic CVD events, but not with CHF events. Future studies should evaluate whether T50 and its determinants represent novel therapeutic targets.

N2  - Background. Anaemia is a well-known complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, thought to increase their risk of cardiovascular events and death. The use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has reduced the need for blood transfusions, improved health-related quality of life and decreased the risk of cardiovascular events/deaths. At the same time, iron deficiency (ID) becomes prevalent and all available guidelines recommend iron supplements to maintain serum ferritin levels >200 ng/mL and transferrin saturation (TSAT) >20%, but do not clearly indicate the upper limits The choice of iron therapy depends both on the stage of CKD and the dialysis modality chosen. Currently, KDIGO guidelines push IV iron to decrease ESA resistance, dose and complications. However, IV iron can lead to adverse reactions, from minor to life threatening1,2. In CKD, excessive IV iron may increase risk for oxidative stress, infections, cardiovascular events and death3,4. Recently, clinical reports have suggested a possible association between iron therapy and vascular calcifications5. Thus, alternative therapy to intravenous iron therapy is of great importance, and Sucrosomial® Iron (SI) has the advantages of safety, tolerability and efficacy that are suitable for CKD patients6-8. Methods. We included 31 consecutive CKD patients (70±14 years old, CKD stages 3 and 4 presenting with anaemia and receiving ESA). Ferritin was ≤200 ng/mL in 19 and >200 ng/mL in 12. They received SI (30 mg mg/day for 6 months) independently of initial iron stores. Iron indices, CRP, iPTH, albumin and ESA dose were assessed after 2, 4 and 6 months. Patients completed a Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire before and after therapy, concerning presence and severity of reflux, indigestion, abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhoea. Data were analysed according to initial ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) levels. Results. As depicted in Table I, Hb value, serum ferritin, TSAT and ESA dose did not change significantly during the study period. Serum ferritin and TSAT values were more stable in patients with ferritin ≤200 ng/mL compared to those with ferritin >200 ng/mL. GSRS at the end of the study was no significantly different than at baseline, with mild dyspepsia being the most frequently reported symptom, and constipation the less frequent. Conclusion. SI proved to be an effective maintenance therapy during the treatment period, thus avoiding the use of IV iron. However, a larger study with a longer follow-up period is needed to ascertain the proper role and dose of SI in CKD patients. [Figure Presented].

N2  - Background: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a severe complication in patients with terminal chronic kidney disease. Main biochemical alterations associated to the decrease of the glomeru-lar filtration rate include the physio pathological role of the fibro-blast growth factor-23 or FGF23-klotho axis. The worldwide prevalence of vascular calcifications is reported between 60-90%. Increased risk of fractures secondary to high bone remodeling (osteitis fibrosa), increasing morbidity and mortality also interfere with patients' quality of life and social interaction due to pain, weakness, pruritus and bone deformation. Parathyroidectomy has been related to reduction of vascular calcifications and the overall mortality rate in 37%, cardiovascular 33%, increase in bone mineral density, control of blood pressure as well as anemia and lower mortality in patients with calciphylaxis. Methods: The clinical and biochemical evolution of postoperative parathyroidectomy patients in the period 2009-2017 was assessed. An observational, retrospective and descriptive univari-ate study was carried out with measures of central tendency and dispersion measure, using the statistical program SPSS 23. Results: Hemodialysis was the renal replacement therapy at the time of surgery in 77% of 200 patients. The duration in re-placement therapy was greater than 5 years. Symptoms decreased in more than 70%. The pre-surgical PTH levels on average were 1964 pg/ml. After the surgical event the levels were <150 pg/ml in both surgical techniques. However, during follow-up, patients submitted to subtotal parathyroidectomy presented a progressive elevation of an average of 402 ng/ml as of the year. As soon as the control of calcium and phosphorus was documented, a reduction in the immediate postoperative period was observed, fulfilling criteria for hungry bone syndrome in >90%. An increase in alkaline phosphatase was found in approximately 50%, with a reduction of 50% per month and normalization achieved after 12 months. Conclusions: The analysis showed the benefits of parathyroid-ectomy in the immediate control of symptoms that affect the quality of life of patients, with a bimodal biochemical evolution, conferring a risk of symptomatic hypocalcemia during the first 6 months, however achieving an adequate control from 12 months, with a reduction in the complications associated with bone mineral disorder. All this improves the quality of life and reduces morbidity and mortality by reducing cardiovascular risk.

N2  - Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in chronic renal failure. It’s known that vascular calcification (VC) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) are strongly associated with cardiovascular diseases. Growth arrest specific protein 6 (Gas6) is a vitamin K-dependent protein and regulates various processes such as proliferation, cell survival, migration and inflammation. Gas6 is known to protect endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells against apoptosis by inhibiting Bcl-2 induced Caspase 3 activation. The relationship between Gas6 and cardiovascular diseases has been demonstrated in many mouse models and cell cultures. However, there are conflicting reports whether Gas6 levels are increasing or decreasing in human studies of diabetic and/or chronic renal failure. In present study the aim was to examine plasma Gas6 levels and its relation with CIMT and coronary artery calcification score (CACS) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods: Total of 137 patients of which 32 chronic hemodialysis and 105 predialysis patients as well as 73 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Human Gas6 levels in serum samples were studied by ELISA method. CIMT was measured by ultrasonography. CACS was measured by multislice computed tomography. Results: The mean age was 54.37±16.61 years in dialysis group, 55.20±14.80 years in predialysis group and 53.26±9.04 years in control group. Serum creatinine was 0.78±0.16 mg/dl in the control group and 1.96±1.64 mg/dl in the predialysis and 5.94±1.55 mg/dl in the dialysis group. 24 hours urine protein levels were significally higher in the dialysis group than the predialysis and the control group. CIMT values were similar in predialysis and dialysis groups. These values were significantly higher than control group. Although CACS was higher in dialysis group than predialysis and control group, the results were not statistically significant since the distribution range was very wide. Gas6 was 98.84±53.32 ng/mL in the control group and statistically higher than dialysis (63.85±38.92 ng/mL) and predialysis groups (54.96±38.49 ng/mL) (p=0.001). Gas6 levels were lower in diabetic patients than non-diabetics (53.69±35.26 ng/mL, 69.26±47.50 ng/mL, p=0.023, respectively). Negative correlation was detected between Gas6 and age, BMI, CACS, carotid IMT and proteinuria. In the logistic regression analysis, Gas6 remained significantly associated with BMI, CIMT and proteinuria. Conclusion: In our study, a negative correlation of Gas6 with BMI, CACS, CIMT and proteinuria and lower Gas6 levels in diabetic patients support that decreased Gas6 levels in chronic renal failure may have a role in vascular calcification through altered glucose tolerance, chronic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and increased apoptosis. Our study has an importance because it is the first study showing a relation between Gas6 and proteinuria, CACS and carotid IMT in patients with chronic renal failure.

N2  - Introduction: Vascular calcification (VC) is one of the factors involved in the increased cardiovascular risk observed in chronic kidney disease. Sclerostin is known to be a down regulator of bone mineralization, and a potential molecule linking the bone-vascular axis. The present study aimed at measuring serum sclerostin level in both dialyzed and undialyzed cases and correlating its serum level with both vascular and valvular types of calcification. Methods: This case control study was conducted on 82 Egyptian subjects of comparable age and gender divided into 20 apparently healthy volunteers as well as 62 chronic kidney disease cases of whom 31 cases were under maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for more than 6 months. Serum sclerostin was measured using an enzyme immunoassay. Results: Significantly higher median serum sclerostin values were observed in each of dialyzed and undialyzed cases compared to each others and to control group. Serum sclersotin was positively correlated with old age, male gender, and VC in dialyzed cases, and inversely correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate in total number of cases. Diagnostic performance of serum sclerostin revealed a sensitive rather than a specific biomarker of both vascular and valvular types of calcification. Multiple regression analysis revealed an independent contribution of male gender, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and valvular calcification to serum sclerostin level. Conclusion: Serum sclerostin level could be used as a potential biomarker for both vascular and valvular types of calcification in chronic kidney disease cases regardless maintenance HD as a treatment modality.

N2  - Background: CKD patients always experience both renal bone disease and vascular calcification (VC). Compared with the non-CKD population, the cardiovascular death rate is at least 10 times higher and in young subjects this risk is more than 100-fold. The aim of this study was to assess prevalence of vascular calcification (VC) in predialysis diabeteic chronic kidney disease(CKD) patients (Stages 3,4 and 5 CKD) compared with non diabetic CKD patients. Methods: The study involved 100 pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients (stages 3,4 and 5). They were divided into two groups, Group I: included 50 non diabetic CKD patients (30 patients in stage 3, 12 in stage 4 and 8 in stage 5 CKD) and Group II: which included 50 diabetic CKD patients (8 patients in stage 3, 18 in stage 4 and 24 in stage 5 CKD). Routine laboratory investigations were done to all patients in addition to the following investigations: iPTH, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3],alkaline phosphatase, ionized Ca, serum Phosphorus, random blood sugar and HbA1C. Radiological imaging (X-Ray abdominal vessels and X-Ray of the hands and pelvis were done to assess VCs in iliac, femoral, radial, digital arteries and abdominal aorta. Calcification score was assessed using Kauppila score [KS] and Adragao score [AS]. Results: Group II had higher significant vascular calcification in stage 4 and 5 CKD (p value = 0.039). The non diabetic group reported lower Adragao VC score compared to diabetic group although the difference was not significant (p = 0.629). Higher significant Kauppila score was found in diabetic group (score > 6) (p = 0.011).There was significant positive correlation between both Adragao and Kauppila VC scores and HbA1C level in diabetic group (p = 0.003, 0.030 respectively). Conclusion: Pre-dialysis diabteic chronic kidney disease patients had significantly high VC than non diabetic CKD. Plain X-rays is agood simple method for practical screening of vascular calcification by Adragao score (AS) and Kaupplia score(KS).

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major risk factor for end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease and premature death. Despite classical clinical risk factors for CKD and some genetic risk factors have been identified, the residual risk observed in prediction models is still high. Therefore, new risk factors need to be identified in order to better predict the risk of CKD in the population. Here, we analyzed the genetic association of 79 SNPs of proteins associated with mineral metabolism disturbances with CKD in a cohort that includes 2,445 CKD cases and 559 controls. Genotyping was performed with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry. We used logistic regression models considering different genetic inheritance models to assess the association of the SNPs with the prevalence of CKD, adjusting for known risk factors. Eight SNPs (rs1126616, rs35068180, rs2238135, rs1800247, rs385564, rs4236, rs2248359, and rs1564858) were associated with CKD even after adjusting by sex, age and race. A model containing five of these SNPs (rs1126616, rs35068180, rs1800247, rs4236, and rs2248359), diabetes and hypertension showed better performance than models considering only clinical risk factors, significantly increasing the area under the curve of the model without polymorphisms. Furthermore, one of the SNPs (the rs2248359) showed an interaction with hypertension, being the risk genotype affecting only hypertensive patients. We conclude that 5 SNPs related to proteins implicated in mineral metabolism disturbances (Osteopontin, osteocalcin, matrix gla protein, matrix metalloprotease 3 and 24 hydroxylase) are associated to an increased risk of suffering CKD.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification is a crucial complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Particularly, CKD patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) manifest severe vascular calcification but its precise mechanisms are poorly understood. It has been reported that oxidative stress plays a key role for the progression of vascular calcification. In the present study, we investigated the pathophysiological mechanisms of vascular calcification in the setting of coexisting CKD and DM particularly from the perspective of oxidative stress. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups as follows; (i) control rats (control group), (ii) 5/6 nephrectomized rats (CKD group), (iii) streptozotocin (STZ) injected rats (DM group), (iv) 5/6 nephrectomized and STZ injected rats (DM+CKD group), (v) DM+CKD rats treated with insulin (DM+CKD+INS group), (vi) DM+CKD rats treated with apocynin, which is an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (DM+CKD+APO group). All groups were fed a high phosphate diet from 11 weeks of age. At 18 weeks, the rats were sacrificed for blood and urine analysis, histopathological analysis and evaluating mRNA expressions of oxidative stress and osteoblast differentiation-related markers in the aorta. Results: Von Kossa-positive mineralized area and calcium content of aorta were significantly increased in the DM+CKD group compared to the control, CKD and DM groups at 18 weeks. However, despite high serum glucose levels control, apocynin treatment prevented the progression of vascular calcification. The mRNA expressions of RUNX2 and ALP and the number of RUNX2-positive cells in the aorta were significantly increased in the DM+CKD group compared to the control, CKD and DM groups. Similarly, these expressions were significantly reduced by apocynin treatment. As for the assessment of oxidative stress, urinary excretion of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), the number of 8-OHdG positive cells in the aorta, and the mRNA expressions of NOX4 and NADPH p22 phox were significantly decreased in the DM+CKD+APO group compared to the DM+CKD group. Conclusions: Our results suggest that coexisting CKD and DM accelerates vascular calcification mainly by increased oxidative stress.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification remains a frequent complication of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this population. Various animal models have been introduced to induce CKD and study the pathomechanism of vascular calcification. The most commonly used such model in rodents is 5/6 nephrectomy followed by using high phosphate diet. However, the 5/6 nephrectomy in mice is markedly challenging and results are seldom consistent. Methods: To address this challenge, we sought to examine a novel model of vascular calcification where ten-week-old mice with DBA2 background that are prone to vascular calcification, underwent unilateral ischemia reperfusion injury (UIRI) for 25 minutes followed by complete right nephrectomy after one week. The control group underwent sham surgery and both groups were fed high phosphate diet (0.6% Ca, 0.9% Pi) for twelve weeks at which point mice were sacrificed for analysis. Results: While serum creatinine did not reveal significant changes (treatment group = 0.12 ± 0.01 mg/dL vs control group = 0.13 ± 0.03 mg/dL), glomerular filtration rate measurements (GFR) were lower in the treatment groups (treatment group = 187.68 ± 31.99 uL/min vs control group = 230.99 ±18.5 uL/min). Furthermore, protein analysis on aortae of the mice demonstrated significant upregulation of osteogenic markers including osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteoblast specific transcription factor, cbfa-1. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that UIRI followed by nephrectomy is a feasible and reproducible model of vascular calcification associated with CKD that would enable study of various transgenic mice to better understand the mechanistic pathways involved in mineralization of vascular tree and targeting novel therapeutics.

N2  - Background: Uromodulin (UMOD) is synthesized exclusively in the kidney and is the most abundant protein in ordinary urine. Common variants for UMOD have been considered an adaptation to protect against urinary tract infections (UTIs). Several GWAS studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) have shown SNPs in UMOD top hits; these variants have also been associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, ESRD and blood pressure, highlighting shared genetic pathways between these traits. In clinical settings, serum UMOD is increasingly considered a more sensitive indicator of functional kidney mass than filtration markers like eGFR, and has been associated prospectively with cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Hypertension, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness are hypothesized mechanisms. Methods: We tested common variants in UMOD and their association with clinically diagnosed phenotypes in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in 188,008 White European Americans from the MVP. Using logistic regression adjusted for sex and 10 principal components, we regressed 1813 phenotypes against our 13 SNPs in models adjusted (and not adjusted) for eGFR. Results: Eight of the common variants had significant associations for CKD (Table 1), renal failure, hypertensive heart or kidney disease and urinary calculus, and two with UTIs. Other significant associations were with premenstrual syndrome. In the eGFR-adjusted models, the strongest associations were with urinary calculus and disease groupings related to congestive heart failure, including non-hypertensive congestive heart failure. Conclusions: This PheWAS confirms that UMOD variants are associated with CKD and ESRD. Other observed associations included kidney stones and UTIs. Mendelian Randomization studies of haplotypes for UMOD variants are underway to further elucidate the role of UMOD in vascular health.

N2  - Background: PTH is a main regulator of RANKL and OPG in bone remodeling. These 3 molecules have a well-known role in vascular calcification (VC). Due to controversies in the direct role of PTH in VC and the discovery of leucine-rich repeatcontaining G-protein-coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) as a new RANKL receptor, we analyzed LGR4 involvement in VC in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: In vivo: We analyzed LGR4, RANK, RANKL and OPG gene expression and aortic calcium content ijn CKD rats fed for 14 weeks a normal phosphorus (0.6% -NP-) or a high phosphorus(0.9% -HP-) diet with or without parathyroidectomy (PTX) and PTH 1-34 supplementation aiming to normalize PTH. Rats with normal renal function fed a NP diet were used as reference. In vitro: We analyzed LGR4, RANK, RANKL and OPG expression and calcium content in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from rat aortas exposed to 3 different culture media (control, calcifying or calcifying plus 10-7/10-9M PTH). To characterize the pathways involved in calcification, the same parameters were examined in VSMC upon silencing of LGR4 or PTH1R (main PTH receptor) or after incubation with specific protein kinase (PK) A or PKC inhibitors, or with forskolin, a specific PKA agonist. Results: CKD significantly increased aortic LGR4 and RANKL mRNA expression and decreased OPG, increasing aortic calcium content. These changes were greater in the group with higher PTH (CKD-HP) and were prevented by PTX. There were no changes in RANK expression under any of the experimental conditions. In VSMC, 10-7M PTH, but not 10-9M PTH, increased LGR4 and RANKL, reduced OPG expression with increases in calcium content. LGR4 and PTH1R silencing significantly attenuated the increases in calcium content induced by 10-7M PTH. Furthermore, silencing of PTH1R and PKA inhibition, but not PKC inhibition, prevented the increases in RANKL and LGR4 and OPG reduction. Exposure to forskolin corroborated these results. Conclusions: In CKD, high PTH increases the aortic expression of LGR4 receptor and its ligand RANKL and decreases OPG inducing VC. These PTH actions in VSMC involve binding to PTH1R and PKA activation. Thus, LGR4 was identified for the first time as a pro-calcifying factor of VSMC in CKD.

N2  - Background: Although systemic inflammation increases the risk for adverse vascular outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the exact players remain unclear. The emerging evidence of the relevance of low density granulocytes (LDGs) in inflammatory conditions led us to evaluate whether LDGs may be associated with inflammatory/procalcifying features in CKD. Methods: LDGs subsets were identified by flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 33 CKD patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis and 15 healthy controls (HC). An additional cohort of 16 CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis and 6 HC was recruited for replication. Defensin3a (DEF3a, a marker of early granulopoiesis) gene expression on PBMCs was quantified by qPCR. Results: Total LDGs (CD15+) and both CD14lowCD16+ and CD14-CD16-subsets were increased in CKD. The relative frequency of the CD14-CD16-subpopulation among the total CD15+ pool was increased in CKD. Both LDG subsets differed in origin and maturation status as demonstrated by their CD11b, CD31, CD62L, Interferon receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and CD68 expression and size/granularity (FSC/SSC) features. LDGs subsets were not associated with parameters of bone and mineral metabolism, time on dialysis, serum cytokines or treatments. The increased CD14-CD16-CD15+ correlated directly with Kauppila scores and DEF3a expression in PBMCs, whereas no association was found with CD14lowCD16+CD15+. Conclusions: CKD is associated with elevated LDGs, showing a skewed distribution towards a CD14-CD16-CD15+ enrichment in blood which correlated with vascular calcification. DEF3a expression in PBMC could be a marker of LDG expansion. These findings support an unprecedented role for LDGs in CKD immunopathogenesis.

N2  - Background: Apabetalone is an inhibitor of BET proteins-epigenetic readers modulating gene expression. In phase 2 trials, apabetalone reduced major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) & improved eGFR in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a risk factor for MACE, as it contributes to vascular calcification & endothelial dysfunction. We examined apabetalone-mediated effects on ALP in CVD patients post-hoc & determined apabetalone's impact on tissue non-specific ALP (TNAP) expression in cell culture systems. Methods: Circulating ALP was measured in CVD patients receiving apabetalone in the 3-month (ASSERT) and 6-month (SUSTAIN & ASSURE) trials. Apabetalone's effect on expression of TNAP (gene symbol ALPL) was determined in cultured primary human hepatocytes (PHH), HepaRG, HepG2, calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) & vascular endothelial cells. Protein abundance & ALP enzyme activity were also measured. Results: In phase 2 trials, baseline serum ALP correlated with MACE (R2=0.87). In ASSERT, apabetalone dose dependently reduced serum ALP (p<0.001 vs placebo). In ASSURE & SUSTAIN, patients on apabetalone (n=331) had greater reduction in serum ALP than placebo (n=166; median % change -3.2 vs -11; p<0.001), including those with CKD, i.e. eGFR<60 (apabetalone n=35 placebo n=13 median % change -6.3 vs -14; p<0.02). In vitro, apabetalone suppressed ALPL expression in PHH, HepaRG & HepG2 cells by 60-80%. Trans-differentiation of VSMCs to calcifying cells resulted in 2.5-fold increase in ALPL gene expression. Apabetalone countered calcium deposition & suppressed ALPL/TNAP gene expression, protein levels & enzyme activity. Apabetalone also downregulated ALPL in aortic endothelial cells, umbilical vein endothelial cells & brain microvascular endothelial cells 50-70%. Conclusions: In phase 2 trials, apabetalone lowered serum ALP. Mechanistically, apabetalone downregulates ALPL/TNAP expression in multiple cell types, which may contribute to reductions in MACE observed in patients. The impact of apabetalone on biomarkers, renal function & CVD outcomes is being evaluated in the phase 3 BETonMACE trial.

N2  - Introduction: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), also known as calciphylaxis, is a rare but life-threatening condition that is characterized by progressive cutaneous necrosis associated with small-and medium-sized vessel calcification, occurring in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on renal replacement therapy. It is a rare condition, described in 1% to 4% of patients on dialysis, mainly in those with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), liver disease, and elevated calcium-phosphate product. Case Description: We describe a case of a 42-years old, male, Filipino, known hypertensive, diabetic, a diagnosed case of chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy on hemodialysis three times a week for two years, who came in with severe progressive calciphylaxis in the form of a chronic painful non-healing necrotic wound on the glans penis. He was initially managed as a case of herpes zoster balanitis when he was seen in the emergency department for out-patient consult, but did not improved with oral acyclovir and oral antibiotics. Also noted in the second and third digit of his right hand, were non healing violaceous and necrotic plaques. Calciphylaxis of Chronic Kidney Disease was considered based on clinical, laboratory and radiologic data. Goals of care and prognosis were discussed with the patient. He opted to be managed medically. His hemodialysis sessions were continued and intensified to four times a week, and he was started on sodium thiosulfate 25g IV x 1 hour to start at the last hour of hemodialysis for three months. Other modalities utilized in the management of this case include hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and topical sodium thiosulfate. On follow-up, patient improved and is currently doing well on hemodialysis despite high mortality and morbidity seen in high patients with CUA Discussion: The pathogenesis of CUA is not well understood, but is thought to be due to vascular calcification leading to soft tissue necrosis that is usually described in patients with end-stage kidney disease on dialysis. Our patient had several predisposing factors for calciphylaxis that had been present for a long time. Nevertheless, the immediate trigger for the acute worsening of calciphylaxis is unknown. Clinical diagnosis of CUA requires a high degree of suspicion.

Calcium and phosphate homeostasis are maintained primarily by regulation of epithelial calcium and phosphate cotransport in the kidney and intestine, processes that are tightly regulated by hormones including 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and parathyroid hormone (PTH). In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as renal function declines, disruption of feedback loops between these hormones have adverse consequences on several organ systems, including the skeleton, heart and vascular system. CKD-associated mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is defined as a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism due to CKD manifested by abnormalities of calcium, phosphorus, PTH or vitamin D metabolism, abnormalities of bone turnover, mineralization and volume, and ectopic soft tissue calcification. Complications of CKD-MBD include vascular calcification, stroke, skeletal fracture and increased risk of death. Increased FGF23 and PTH concentrations, and 1,25(OH)2D deficiency contribute to the pathogenesis of CKD-MBD. Therefore, treatment of patients with CKD-MBD is focused on restoring the feedback loops to maintain normal calcium and phosphate balance to prevent skeletal and cardiovascular complications.

N2  - Premature mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is linked to the progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In CKD, marked reductions in the kidneys' ability to excrete excess phosphate and calcium results in extra-osseous mineral deposition, particularly vascular calcification (VC), causing a significant decline in vascular health. Regulation of circulating calcium and phosphate is dependent, in part, on 1,25-dihydroxvitamin D3 (calcitriol), as well as the signalling molecules parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23). Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, is made primarily in the kidneys. In CKD, calcitriol production declines generating secondary hyperparathyroidism, a condition which is managed by administering calcitriol or other vitamin D mimetics. However, activation of vitamin D receptors can also lead directly and/or indirectly to the development of VC. This study was designed to assess the temporal basis of calcitriol-induced VC in the absence of CKD, as the complex CKD phenotype can confound the profile of VC pathophysiology in the adenine-induced CKD model. The study, in male Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 15-16 weeks, was approved by the Queen's Animal Care Committee in accordance with the guidelines from the Canadian Council on Animal Care. After acclimation, rats were randomly sorted into either a subcutaneous (n=8) or an intraperitoneal injection group (n=5). Of these rats, one group received 1.0% dietary phosphate (n=10) while a second group received a 0.5% phosphate diet (n=3). After 72 hours on their diets, calcitriol was administered daily (0.5 or 1μg/kg dose) for 8 days. Daily blood samples were taken to monitor changes in biomarker profiles. At the end of the treatments, all animals were sacrificed and tissues were collected to determine vascular mineral content, serum hormone levels and vascular histology. Animals who received 8 doses, regardless or injection method, dose, or dietary phosphate all developed VC. The development of VC was associated with hypercalcemia, however, elevations in serum phosphate did not occur in these animals. Animals who received fewer than 8 doses did not develop VC, but were found to be hypercalcemic. The mechanisms responsible for the development of VC have not been fully elucidated. Characterizing calcitriol- induced VC in the absence of CKD will enable insight into the mechanisms involved as well as provide the basis for improved therapeutic strategies.

N2  - Objectives: Whether factors influencing high ankle-Brachial index (ABI) were various between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and non-Dialyzed CKD patients had not been fully elucidated. The study was aimed to investigate the possible predictors of high ABI between these two types of patients. Methods: Totally 243 participants patients were enrolled and divided into CKD 1, non-Dialyzed CKD 2-5 and PD groups. Logistic regression and mediation analysis were conducted to estimate the possible predictors mediating ABI values. Results: The prevalence of high ABI, correlated with increased cardiovascular events, increased with lower E-Gfr. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors like systolic blood pressure (SBP) had a close correlation with high ABI in non-Dialyzed CKD patients (SBP: β = 0.059, SE = 0.017, P = 0.001). But in PD patients, abnormal serum calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) might have greater effect on ABI (Ca: β =-8.509, SE = 1.677, P < 0.001; P: β = 1.132, SE = 0.425, P = 0.008). Moreover, PD patients with Kt/V≥1.7 suffered lower prevalence of high ABI than those with Kt/V < 1.7 (23.4% vs. 45.0%, P = 0.049). Further mediation analysis revealed that the relationship between Kt/V and high ABI was mediated by Ca in PD patients but not non-Dialyzed ones (PD patients: ab =-0.220, 95%CI:-0.381 to-0.059, P = 0.008; non-Dialyzed CKD patients: ab =-0.115, 95%CI:-2.427 to 2.198, P = 0.928). Conclusion: High ABI values predicted incremental cardiovascular risk in PD patients. Furthermore, PD inadequacy correlates with increased high ABI occurrence and serum calcium might be an important mediator. Improvement of PD adequacy seemed to be an effective method to reduce high ABI for PD patients.

N2  - Aim: The objective of this study is to associate between sclerostin and calcium and organic phosphorus levels in predialytic chronic kidney disease patients. Background: Sclerostin is a 190-amino-glycoprotein plays a role in decreasing bone formation by inhibiting osteoblastic differentiation through Wnt signaling pathways and enhancing apoptosis. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), sclerostin is a biomarker Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) and contributors to cardiovascular disease, through increased vascular calcification. Method: This is a cross-sectional design using secondary data of previous sclerostin linkage to vascular calcification study. Result: The results showed that mean levels of calcium and organic phosphorus between stage 3, 4, and 5 CKD, consecutively were 8.71, 8.74 and 8.24 (significantly different, p = 0.027) for calcium and 3.42, 3.47 and 4.08 (significantly different, p = 0.006) for organic phosphorus. There were no significant difference of CaP product among patients with stage 3,4, and 5 of CKD (p > 0,05). There was significant correlation between calcium and sclerostin (r = 0.254; p < 0.05), however, there were no significant correlation between phosphorus and sclerostin (r = 0.069; p = 0.274) and between CaP product and sclerostin (r = 0.170; p = 0.068). Conclusion: There is a positive correlation between calcium levels and sclerostin and the decline in kidney function affects bone mineral homeostasis.

N2  - Aim: To evaluate the effect of Cinacalcet cessation on biochemical markers and rates of Parathyroidectomy in Topend of Northern Territory. Background: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a well-known complication in Chronic Kidney Disease. Hyperparathyroidism is associated with bone pain, fractures, vascular calcification and increased cardiovascular risk. According to the EVOLVE study, Cinacalcet did not show benefit in reducing the cardiovascular mortality but significantly reduced the requirement for Parathyroidectomy. Due to the limited resources, number of Parathyroidectomies performed in Northern Territory is lower compared to rest of the Australia. Since Cinacalcet was PBS-delisted in August 2015 Parathyroidectomy became the only treatment option available. In Northern Territory Parathyroidectomies are performed only at Royal Darwin Hospital. Methods: We collected retrospective data from electronic records on Parathyroidectomies (n = 19) performed in Royal Darwin Hospital between 2012 and 2018. We included the total number of patients on Cinacalcet (n = 42) before August 2015 and excluded the paediatric population. We conducted standard t-test to analyse the difference in biochemical parameters with effect to Cinacalcet. Results: The number of Parathyroidectomies increased from two per year to four per year post cessation of Cinacalcet. Nearly half of these patients were on Cinaclacet until it was PBS-delisted. Mean PTH levels increased from 140.8 pmoL/L to 176.4 pmoL/L and mean Calcium levels increased from 2.27 mmoL/L to 2.34 mmoL/L, whereas mean phosphate levels were decreased from 1.75 mmoL/L to 1.41 mmoL/L. Conclusions: Cinacalcet cessation led to increase in PTH levels and the number of parathyroidectomies in Northern Territory. We need further analysis into risk of fractures in association with Cinacalcet cessation and cost analysis to postulate the advantage.

N2  - Background: Although the graded association between renal and cognitive function is well-recognized, the effect of renal-associated factors beyond estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, in mL/min/1.73 m2) and urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR, in mg/g) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is unclear. We sought to identify renal metabolic factors associated with prevalent moderate to severe cognitive impairment (mod/sev CI) in CKD participants in the BRain IN Kidney disease (BRINK) study. Methods: Participants were ≥ 45 years old with moderate/severe (non-dialysis) CKD (eGFR) < 60) in Minneapolis/St. Paul. Metabolic measures obtained at baseline included serum phosphorus, calcium, cystatin C, TNFαR1, F-2 isoprostane (oxidative stress), PTH, hemoglobin and hgbA1c. Logistic regression models for mod/sev CI were run with metabolic factors, adjusted for demographics and comorbidities. Neuropsychological testing was performed using the 3MS, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (memory); Color Trails 1 and 2, Symbol-Digit-Modalities Test (executive function), and Controlled Oral Word Association Test and animal naming (language). Results: Among 433 CKD participants at baseline, (Table 1) mean age was 70 years, mean education 14 years; 16% were non- white; mean (SD) eGFR was 34.3 (11.8). After adjusting for renal function and cardiovascular comorbidities, serum phosphorus ≥ 4.0 mg/dL (mean 3.6) was associated with mod/sev CI among those with mild/moderate CKD (eGFR 30 - < 60); OR [95% CI] of 2.59 [1.16-5.79)]; P=0.020, whereas elevated TNFaR1 (mean 3598 pg/mL), was significant in both all CKD; OR =1.39, [1.08,1.79], P =0.010 and eGFR 30 - < 60 group,1.52 [1.12, 2.05]; P = 0.007. Conclusions: Phosphorus ≥ 4.0 and increased inflammation (TNFaR1) are potentially modifiable risk factors for mod/sev CI in mild/moderate CKD patients, the most common CKD group in the US, with prevalence of > 3 million. High phosphorus may contribute to CI through impaired cerebral vascular endothelial function and relaxation and increased vascular calcification. Initiation of phosphate binders at lower levels of serum phosphorus than current recommended guidelines, and novel anti-inflammatory agents are possible interventions to delay cognitive decline in CKD.

N2  - Vascular calcification (VC) is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD), where cardiovascular mortality remains the leading cause of death. Here, we examined the role of high-mobility group box1 (HMGB1), a nuclear DNA-binding protein involved in inflammation, in aortic calcification and renal dysfunction induced by high phosphate in a mouse model of CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. HMGB1 and kidney function markers were measured by ELISA in the serum of CKD patients and in CKD mice. Sections of the aortas of mice were analyzed by immunofluorescence and Alizarin red staining, and protein lysates were generated to analyze the expression of related proteins in response to silencing of HMGB1 or β-catenin by western blotting. Our results showed that serum HMGB1 levels were significantly higher in CKD patients than in healthy controls and related to disease stage. High phosphate promoted the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytosol and aortic calcification in CKD mice in vivo, whereas HMGB1 knockdown ameliorated part of renal and vascular function. β-catenin silencing reversed high phosphate-induced calcification and restored renal marker levels. Taken together, our results suggest that HMGB1 is involved in VC associated with CKD via a mechanism involving the β-catenin.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of morbidity and mor-tality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Traditional cardiovas-cular risk factors only partially explain the high mortality rates observed in these patients. Vascular calcification (VC) in the medial layer of the arterial wall is a unique and prominent feature in patients with CKD. Medial VC has been recognized as an important predictor and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and all-cause and mortality in these patients. VC in CKD is triggered by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) transforming into oste-oblast-like cells that express bone matrix proteins, as consequence of elevated circulating phosphate levels due to poor kidney function and dis-turbances in bone metabolism. Understanding and targeting this SMC trans-differentiation and subsequent VC represents a viable therapeutic avenue for managing CKD complications. Similar to bone formation, VC is a highly regulated process that draws many parallels with osteogenic differentiation. We have recently observed that T-cell Death Associated Gene 51 (TDAG51), a protein upregulated by oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, is induced in SMCs under conditions of hyperphosphatemia and is expressed in the medial layer of calcified human vessels. We have found in mouse VSMCs isolated from TDAG51-/- aortas, reduced transcriptional activity of Runx2, a well-known driver of phosphate-inducible VC. In addition to RunX2, we also identified that TDAG-/- VSMCs express reduced levels of Pit-1, a solute transporter responsible for cellular phosphate uptake, and another well-known driver of VC. Furthermore, overexpression of Pit-1 in the TDAG51-/-VSMCs resulted in phosphate uptake and mineral deposition similar to the levels observed in TDAG51+/+ VSMCs. Thus, TDAG51 is an important mediator of phosphate-induced VC in VSMC through the down-regulation of Pit-1 and represents a novel potential therapeutic target for the prevention of VC in patients [Figure Presented].

N2  - Background and purpose: Chronic renal failure is a syndrome characterized by progressive and irreversible loss of nephrons depending on various diseases. Especially infection such as HBV and HCV is among the major causes of mortality and morbidity in hemodialysis patients.In the present study we aimed to determine the levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and heat shock protein (HSP70) in chronic renal failure patients diagnosed with HBV, HCV and non-hepatitis undergoing hemodialysis treatment. Materials and methods: Samples of 235-patients receiving hemodialysis treatment and 25-healthy individuals were included in the study. Firstly, HBV and HCV positivity were diagnosed by serological Enzyme-Linked ImmunuSorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Then, 3-NT levels were determined using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), while TWEAK and HSP70 were determined using high sensitivity ELISA. The numbers of patients used in the studies were determined according to statistical power analysis. Results: The values of 3-NT and HSP70 were found to be significantly higher non-hepatitis patients, HBV and HCV patients receiving hemodialysis treatment to compared with the control group (p‹0.05). Concentration of TWEAK in non-hepatitis and HBV patients receiving hemodialysis therapy was found to be significantly higher to compared with the control group (p‹0.05). However, unlike the other two groups, an increase in the TWEAK of HCV patients on post-dialysis was determined. Conclusions: To prevent the increase of inflammation and oxidative stress in hemodialysis patients or to keep it under control, investigating certain parameters such as TWEAK, 3-NT and HSP70 from time to time is of great importance in terms of minimizing the level of risk for many diseases such as cardiovascular diseases. Infection also increases the burden on oxidative stress and immunity system in these patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Sclerostin is actively being studied now as a factor that not only regulates osteogenesis but as a suggested marker of cardiovascular calcification (CVC) in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Importantly, sclerostin is also associated with clinical outcomes, but results are conflicting. The aim of the study was to examine the association between serum sclerostin levels and CVC magnitude in CKD patients (a cross-sectional study). METHODS: 131 CKD Russian patients (average age 42,4613,7 years) 1-5D stages were included in the study. Control group was 35 healthy volunteers, matched by sex and age with main group. Serum sclerostin was measured by ELISA (Biomedica, Austria). In addition to routine laboratory tests, instrumental examinations included: central (aortic) blood pressure (BP), Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI) by 'Sphygmacor' device (Australia); vascular calcinosis score-VCS (X-ray of the abdominal aorta in lateral projection-Kauppila method); left ventricular myocardium mass index (LVMMI), left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD), cardiac (valvular) calcification score-CCS (EchoCG, semiquantitative scale). All the patients signed informed research consent. All the procedures were performed in accordance with Helsinki Declaration. RESULTS: It was found that serum sclerostin levels increased along with CKD advanced, starting at 3A stage, while serum phosphorus and parathyroid hormone (PTH), as traditional CKD progression markers, were started to increase from stage 4-5 CKD. In univariate analysis serum sclerostin levels correlated positively with the central systolic BP [r= 0,542; p<0,01], PWV [r= 0,632; p<0,01], CCS [r=0,612; p<0,01], VCS [r=0,523;p<0,01], LVMMI [r=0,545; p<0,01] and LVDD [r=0,459; p<0,05]. However after multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, sclerostin remained and begun inversely associated with AI [beta=-0,014, p<0,05], VCS [beta=-0,057 p<0,001] and CCS [beta=-0,185, p<0,05] only. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of sclerostin are increased along with CKD advanced. Besides its important role in bone metabolism it may be useful as early biomarker, that protects heart and vessels against calcification in CKD advancing.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: One of the severe and prevalent co-morbidities in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is vascular calcification (VC). The key trigger of VC in CKD is high serum phosphate level, although not listed as a uremic toxin in our European Uremic Toxins (EUTox) database. During dialysis, phosphate is removed from the blood, and the effective removal is crucial for preventing the development and/or aggravation of VC.The study aims to evaluate the calcification capability of CKD phosphate levels and compare the removal of phosphate during the different dial-ysis modalities. Methods: Ten uremic patients, 5 males, and 5 females mean age 59 6 16 years, were followed during 30 chronic midweek hemodialysis sessions.Three dialysis modality with different settings were used once for each patient in a cross-over design (Table 1). Patients' pre-dialysis phosphate level was measured to quantify the initial plasma con-centration before dialysis. The total removed phosphate (TRP) amount and phosphate reduction ratio (PRR) were calculated to compare different treatment modalities. To mimic the role of increased phosphate regarding vascular calcification, human aortic smooth muscle cells and rat aortic rings were cultured for 7 days in healthy and CKD medium. Healthy medium consisted of DMEM with 0.9 mM phosphate, 1.8 mM calcium and 2.5% fetal calf serum. In CKD medium phosphate was added to reach 1.6 mM concentration in human aortic smooth muscle cells and 2.0 mM in rat aortic rings. Calcium and protein content was estimated in cells, and histochemical von Kossa staining was performed for rat aortic rings.The results were compared using student T-test. Results: Patients mean pre-dialysis serum phosphate levels were 1.70 6 0.58 mmol/L, approximately the doubling of the concentration in healthy subjects (0.81-1.45 mmol/L). Significantly (p<0.01) increased calcification was showed in cells and rat aortic rings incubated in CKD medium (Figure 1 a and b). [Figure Presented] [Table Presented] Conclusions: The results demonstrate that elevated phosphate levels presented in CKD patients increase vascular calcification in human vascular cells and rat aorta. It makes effective removal of phosphate crucial for CKD patients. The removed phosphate amounts using different dialysis modalities show significant differences. It dem-onstrates the possibility to adjust phosphate removal during dialysis.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins, such as BRD4, modulate gene expression by bridging acetylated histones & transcrip-tion factors with transcriptional regulators. Apabetalone, an orally active BET inhibitor, reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with CVD and improved eGFR in a subpopulation with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in phase 2 trials. In CKD patients, vascular calcification (VC) increases CVD risk & is a predictor of all-cause mortality. Because VC is associated with MACE, effects of BET inhibition on processes associated with VC were examined. Methods: Proteomic profiling of plasma was conducted in CVD patients receiving apabetalone inthe3month (ASSERT) and6month (SUSTAIN & ASSURE) phase2tri-als, as well as in patients with stage 4/5 CKD receiving a single dose in a phase 1 pharma-cokinetic study. Human coronary artery vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were used to assess expression of VC markers, trans-differentiation in osteogenic conditions, and extracellular mineralization that leads to pathology. ChIP-seq examined BRD4 assembly on chromatin during osteogenic trans-differentiation and the effects of apabetalone. Results: Apabetalone reduced circulating levels of proteins associated with VC in phase 2 trials in CVD patients including osteopontin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), & alka-line phosphatase (ALP). Proteomic assessment of plasma from CKD patients vs matched controls demonstrated activation of molecular pathways driving VC including BMP-2 signaling and RANK signaling in osteoclasts. Both pathways were downre-gulated by apabetalone 12 hours post dose in the CKD cohort. Mechanistic effects of apabetalone were examined in vitro. Trans-differentiation of VSMCs with osteogenic conditions induced expressionof ALP, OPG, RUNX2 & WNT5A, which was sup-pressed by apabetalone. Further, apabetalone dose dependently countered extracellular calcium deposition. Compared to basal conditions, trans-differentiation to a calcifying phenotype promoted re-distribution of BRD4 on chromatin, resulting in fewer enhancers (118 in osteogenic, 288 in basal). 38 unique enhancers were generated in osteogenic conditions, several of which were in proximity to genes associated with calcification. Apabetalone dose dependently reduced levels of BRD4 on many of these enhancers, which correlated with decreased expression of the associated gene. Genome wide, apabetalone decreased the size of BRD4 containing enhancers, consistent with its mechanism of action. Conclusions: In clinical trials, apabetalone mediates reduction of factors & pathways associated with VC. Involvement of BRD4 in VSMC trans-differentiation & calcification is a novel discovery. BRD4 ChIP-seq identified novel factors associated with trans-differentiation, and thus potential targets to oppose VC. Inhibition of BRD4 by apabetalone resulted in fewer BRD4 containing enhancers, and reduced expression of genes that promote (a) trans-differentiation & (b) extracellular calcium deposition. The impact of chronic treatment with apabetalone on biomarkers, renal function and CVD outcomes in patients with impaired kidney function is being studied in the phase 3 BETonMACE outcomes trial.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a significant independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is considered the leading cause of mortality in CKD patients. Cardiovascular calcification (CVC) is an active process involving a complex interaction of inducers and inhibitors. It is more severe and extensive in CKD, and its prevalence increases steadily with the disease progression. Silent myocardial injury is responsible for the development of adverse cardiac events even in patients with early stages of CKD. High sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) assay detects troponin T with higher sensitivity and precision at an earlier point of time than the conventional assays, and its elevation is associated with poor outcomes. Serum Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is classed as an inhibitory factor for CVC. It is involved in the pathological processes of vascular damage and linked to the excess car-diovascular morbidity in CKD. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the extent of cardiovascular calcifications and their associations with serum OPG and hs-cTnT levels in patients with CKD stages 3-5. Methods: Ninety CKD patients were enrolled in this study, and they were divided into 2 groups: group I included 45 non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients (stages 3-5) and group II included 45 chronic hemodialysis patients. Each group further subdivided according to the presence of CVC into subgroup A and B. Vascular calcifications were assessed by lateral lumbar, pelvis and hands X-ray radiographs. Valvular calcification was assessed by echocardiography. Serum cardiac troponin T was measured by high sensitivity assay and serum OPG was measured by ELISA. Results: Cardiovascular calcification distribution was 22.2% in group I and 33.3% in group II. Serum levels of OPG and hs-cTnT in calcification groups (IA and IIA) were significantly higher than non-calcification groups (IBandIIB) (P < 0.001). CVCcorre-lated positively with OPG, hs-cTnT and phosphorus. OPG and phosphorus were significant independent predictors of CVC at cut-off values > 4.6 ng/L and > 6.95 mg/dl, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Serum osteoprotegerin and serum hs-cTnT levels are strongly associated with CVC. In addition, there is a positive association between CVC and hs-cTnT. This suggests a role for OPG in the pathogenesis and risk stratification of CVC and myocardial injury in CKD patients is strongly linked with CVC.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between the content of extracellular matrix components: proteoglycans/glycosamino-glycans collagen and vascular calcifications (VC) assessed histologically in fragments of radial artery, and cardiovascular (CV) events occurring during five-year observation period in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Methods: The studied group consisted of 57 patients, 28 hemodialyzed and 19 pre-dialysis, at stage 5 of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Table 1. ∗Quantitative data are reported as median (lower quartile; upper quartile).Fragments of radial artery obtained during creation of hemodialysis access were examined histologically. The sections were stained to demonstrate matrix proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans (alcian blue), collagen (sirius red) and calcifications (alizarin red). Their relative contents were assessed semiquantitatively (staining grades 1-3). Results: The grades of staining for proteoglycans/glycosaminoglycans, collagen, and calcifications in media of radial artery were positively correlated with gamma coefficients of 0.50 between alcian blue and sirius red staining (p=0.002), 0.59 between alcian blue and alizarin red staining (p<0.001) and 0.38 between sirius red and alizarin red staining (p=0.010). The intensity of staining for matrix proteoglycans/glycosaminogly-cans and collagen showed an association with coexisting comorbidities. Patients with grade 3 of alcian blue staining were more often affected by diabetes (75% vs. 21%; p=0.037). One-third of patients with grade 2 or 3 of alcian blue or sirius red staining (35% and 33%, respectively) had a history of myocardial infarction (p=0.006 and 0.035, respectively), not found in patients with grade 1 staining. Moreover, history of venous thromboembolic disease was more prevalent among patients with grade 2 or 3 of alcian blue staining (32% vs. 6%; p=0.046). We observed no relations between alcian blue or sirius red staining and dialysis status, smoking status, dyslipidemia, or obesity. Conclusions: The intensity of histological stainings in radial arteries reflecting the contents of the selected extracellular components in the vascular wall correlate with cardiovascular morbidities such as myocardial infarction and venous thromboembolic disease in CKD patients. We postulate that simple staining of a small sample of radial artery obtained (and usually discarded) during creation of arteriovenous fistula for hae-modialysis may be of use to preliminarily assess CV risk in ESRD patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Plasma KIM1, a marker of renal tubular injury, has been mentioned in some previous studies to be associated to cardiovascular risk factors. Chronic inflammation is one of the non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors in CKD patients. The purpose of this study was to show the relationship between chronic inflammation, plasma KIM1 levels and cardiovascular factors in CKD patients. METHODS: We conducted a single-center cross-sectional study that included 63 CKD G5D patients (hemodialysis duration for 1-5 years) and 63 CKD patients not on dialysis (stages 1-5, mean eGFR 65.15+/-32.45 ml/min). All patients have been assessed regarding cardiovascular disease (history, echocardiography and ECG). Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method we assessed plasma levels of KIM-1 and interleukin 6 (IL6) and using standard methods blood biochemistry. RESULTS: Mean plasma KIM1 levels in hemodialysis patients was 267.1 +/-482.9 pg/ ml while in predialysis patients it was 217.48 +/-267.10 pg/ml, without being statistically significant. Mean Il-6 values in hemodialysis patients was significantly lower compared to patients in the predialysis stage (7.3 +/-5.1 pg/ml vs. 9.5+/-7.6 pg/ml, p=0.05). In hemodialysis patients serum KIM1 levels showed a statistically significant correlation with mean CRP (r=0.28, p=0.02) and IL6 (r=0.36, p=0.005), a correlation that was not observed in predialysis patients. We found out using ANOVA that patients with left ventricular hypertrophy showed decreased levels of KIM1 (155.51 vs 432.12 pg/ml; p=0.026), and also patients with vascular calcifications on echocardiography had lower levels of serum KIM1 (210.01 vs 462.58 pg/ml, p=0.04). There was no statistically significant correlation between plasma KIM1 and ejection fraction, but patients with ejection fraction below 40% have been excluded from the study. We also did not find any correlation between inflammation markers and the studied cardiovascular markers in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that the inflammatory biomarker IL-6 is lower in hemodialysis patients compared to predialysis CKDpatients could suggest that dialysis-related factors are not themain factors involved in the inflammatory state in CKDpatients. Regarding the tubular injury marker KIM-1, we found an association with chronic inflammation only in hemodialysis patients, and surprisingly lower values in patients with vascular calcifications or left ventricular hypertrophy. These findings raise the question of the usefulness of plasma KIM-1 as a cardiovascular marker in hemodialysis patients.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Vascular calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD), vascular disease and diabetes, and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Vascular calcification is thought to increase as CKD progresses, in association with development of CKD mineral and bone disorder. Vascular calcification can be quantified from plain lateral lumbar x-rays. Using baseline data from a clinical trial of vitamin K supplementation (K4Kidneys: ISRCTN21444964), we assessed factors associated with vascular calcification in patients with CKD stage 3b and 4. METHODS: Patients from a single centre participating in the K4Kidneys trial were included. Vascular calcification was estimated from lateral lumbar x-rays taken at the baseline trial visit. An overall vascular calcification score was determined independently by two authors according to the severity of calcific deposits in the aortic wall adjacent to L1-L4 vertebrae (the Kauppila method). The average total vascular calcification score was used for analysis. Demographic and baseline biochemical data were extracted from the electronic patient record. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with vascular calcification score. The intra-class correlation coefficient was used to determine inter-observer agreement on vascular calcification score. Analyses were conducted using stats and Hmisc packages for R statistical software package. RESULTS: There were 122 patients with CKD 3b and 4 included in the analysis: 72 (59%) were male and average age was 65 years. Seventy-three (59.8%) patients with vascular calcification (vascular calcification score > 1) were older (70 vs 58 years) with higher systolic blood pressure (142 vs 135 mmHg). Those with vascular calcification had more pre-existing vascular disease (67.1 vs 40.8%) but similar proportion of diabetes (27.4 vs 28.6%). Duration (median 7.2 vs 7.0 years) and severity (CKDEPI 29.3 vs 29.5 ml/min) of CKD were similar. There were no significant differences in calcium, phosphate, albumin, parathyroid hormone, log urine protein:creatinine ratio or body mass index. On multiple linear regression analysis, factors associated with vascular calcification score were higher age at lateral lumbar x-ray (OR 0.16 per year increase in age; p<0.001), lower body mass index (OR-0.21 per unit increase in kg/m2; p=0.02), higher systolic blood pressure (OR 0.10 per unit increase in mmHg; p=0.001) or history of vascular disease (OR 2.5; p=0.01). Intra-class correlation coefficient for vascular calcification score (2 raters) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.96). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CKD stage 3b/4, vascular calcification score was associated with increased age and systolic blood pressure, lower body mass index, history of vascular disease, but not with duration or severity of CKD or traditional markers of disordered mineral and bone metabolism. These offer few specific targets for intervention to slow development of vascular calcification in patients with CKD. Other remediable factors-including vitamin D/K status and activity of calcification inhibitors-are likely to be important in this group and warrant further study.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a powerful risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality. Disturbances in phosphate homeostasis have been associated with CV events and death, particularly among individuals with CKD. Although hyperphosphatemia has been recognized as an important factor involved in uremic vasculopathy by inducing vascular calcification through the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells to osteoblast-like cells, the role of phosphate homeostasis on endothelial dysfunction (ED) in CKD is less clear.We aimed to investigate the influence of a low phosphate diet on endothelial function in a pre-dialysis CKD population. METHODS: Fifteen pre-dialysis CKD patients (10M:5F), aged 59615 years, presenting an estimated GFR of 49,2634,2ml/min/1,73m2 (CKD-Epi) and Charlson index of 563 were recruited. Patients were evaluated during basal phosphate intake (BPi) and after a 14 day period of a low phosphate diet including 700 mg/day (LPi). Dietary Pi intake was assessed during BPi using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, validated for the adult population. Endothelial function (Reactive Hyperemia Index, Endopath 2000) as well as blood levels of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and progenitor endothelial cells (EPCs) were assessed in both BPi and LPi periods. RESULTS: Mean daily phosphate intake during BPi was 11226256mg. No significant differences were observed in phosphate serum levels between BPi and LPi periods (3.5760.63 vs 3.4860.57, p=0.520); in addition, both FGF23 and PTHi serum levels did not differ between BPi and LPi periods (FGF23, 2956104 vs 214661 pg/ml, p=0.73; PTHi, 92.5±59.6 vs 86.8±39.8 pg/ml, p=0.91); moreover, EPCs blood levels did not differ between the two periods (BPi, 1.8≥10-362≥10-4, LPi, 1.7≥10-363≥10-4, p=0.85). However, endothelial function was significantly improved during LPi in comparison with BPi (1.760.4 vs 2.160.6; p<0.05) and this was accompanied by a non-significant decrease in CECs blood levels during LPi (5.8≥10-369≥10-4 vs. 3.5≥10-364≥10-4, p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the reduced number of patients studied, our preliminary results strongly suggest that low phosphate intake contributes to improve ED in pre-dialysis CKD patients.

N2  - The current gold standard for diagnosing PAD is Ankle Brachial Index (ABI). However, vascular calcification can falsely elevate ABI. No studies have compared the diagnostic value of peripheral calcium score (PCS) in lower extremity arteries with ABI. Primary aim of this study was to describe the association of PCS with continuous ABI values and categories of ABI in a retrospective cohort design. We identified 50 patients who underwent CTA and ABI measurements [ABI categories for PAD severity: severe (<0.5), moderate (0.5-0.9), normal (0.9-1.4), noncompressible (>1.4)]. We evaluated CTAs imaged from abdominal aorta through lower extremities and determined total calcium volume of plaques with density >130 HU and area >1mm from infrarenal abdominal aorta to the foot using TeraRecon by two independent readers (Intra class correlation 99%). We explored the association between ABI and PCS in SAS using multiple linear regression and analysis of covariance adjusting for age, race, smoking status, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. We found that ABI was inversely associated with PCS in linear regression (p<0.01, Figure 1A). Differences in mean PCS were statistically significant across ABI categories [Fβ,29)= 5.03, p=0.01, Figure 1B]. Across subgroups, the mean PCS was significantly different for ABIs <0.5 and 0.5-0.9 (p=0.02), <0.5 and >1.4 (p<0.001), 0.5-0.9 and >1.4 (p=0.04), 0.9-1.4 and >1.4 (p=0.05). Proportion of tibial calcium to overall PCS was much lower in ABI<0.5: 0.0003 vs ABI>1.4: 0.357 (p=0.02). Mean PCS may be a valid measure of PAD severity and percentage of tibial calcium may help quantify PAD burden in non-compressible vessels. Our study serves as proof of concept for a comprehensive PCS system to diagnose and evaluate PAD severity, particularly in high-risk subpopulations where non-invasive studies may be unreliable.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). More than half of all deaths from patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis can be attributed to CVD. Although traditional risk factors for CVD are prevalent in ESRD, they cannot fully explain the high mortality rates. Vascular calcification (VC) in the medial layer of the vessel wall is a unique and prominent feature in patients with advanced CKD and is now recognized as an important predictor and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and all-cause and mortality in these patients. VC in CKD is triggered by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) transforming into osteoblasts, a consequence of elevated circulating phosphate levels due to poor kidney function. Understanding and targeting this SMC trans-differentiation and subsequent VC represents a viable therapeutic avenue for managing CKD complications. Similar to bone formation, VC is a highly regulated process that draws many parallels with osteogenic differentiation. We have recently observed that T-cell Death Associated Gene 51 (TDAG51), a protein upregulated by oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, is induced in SMCs under conditions of hyperphosphatemia and is expressed in the medial layer of calcified human vessels. We have found that ablation of TDAG51 reduces SMC trans-differentiation and VC, both in human SMCs treated with TDAG51 siRNA and in mouse VSMCs isolated from TDAG51-/- aortas. To explain these findings, we observed that TDAG-/- VSMCs express reduced levels of the of the Pit-1, a solute transporter responsible for cellular phosphate uptake. Consistent with this observation, reduced Pit-1 expression was associated with reduced intracellular phosphate levels and reduced phosphate-induced apoptosis. Further, TDAG-/- VSMCs exhibit significantly reduced transcriptional activity of a phosphate-inducible transcription factor, and well-established driver of VC, known as Runx2.

N2  - Purpose of study Calciphylaxis is a rare and serious complication of chronic renal failure characterised by vascular calcium overload. It has a high mortality rate. This is a case of systemic calciphylaxis with deep vascular and dermal involvement. Presentation 38-year-old male with past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension and end stage renal disease, not on dialysis, presented to hospital with two weeks of SOB, productive cough, bilateral lower extremity oedema, diffuse rash on upper and lower extremities and severe penile pain and dysuria. Hospital Course Diffuse rash turned into tender necrotic eschars. Penile lesion developed into necrotic eschar involving entire glans. Patient developed severe pain in his lower extremities. Plain films of lower extremities revealed severe vessel calcifications. Labs were remarkable for elevated calcium phosphate product and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Management and stabilisation of condition included dialysis, calcimimetics and sodium thiosulfate. Over the course of the next several months, patient underwent penectomy and multiple limb amputations. Discussion Calciphylaxis was once thought to be a rare complication of ESRD but is becoming more common, possibly secondary to increased recognition of symptoms. The best treatment is not yet known but some ideas include sodium thiosulfate and non-calcium-containing phosphate binders such as sevelamer, cinacalcet for patients with elevated PTH, hyperbaric oxygen, sterile maggot therapy. Pathophysiology is not well understood but clinical manifestations result from reduction in arteriolar blood flow. Medial vessel calcification occurs first. Ongoing vascular endothelial injury causes cutaneous arteriolar narrowing, and hypercoagulable state that causes tissue infarction. Deep vascular involvement will subsequently lead to limb ischemia. Conclusion Calciphylaxis was once thought to be a rare complication of ESRD but is becoming more common, possibly secondary to increased recognition of symptoms. In this case, findings included arteriolar calcifications resulting in necrotic skin lesions as well as deep vascular calcifications easily identified with plain films. Clinical suspicion of Calciphylaxis must remain high in ESRD as early diagnosis and intervention can help to avoid amputation.

N2  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the management of mineral and bone disorders (MBD) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Iran and the extent to which KDIGO goals were met. Methods: This multi-centre observational studywasconductedonpatients withCKDstages 4, 5, and5D. Data were collectedfroma total of 209patients withnosurgical or medical conditions that precluded their participation. This study assessed the frequency of measurements, serum levels of phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and parathyroid hormone (PTH), the achievement of the targets recommended by the 2009 KDIGO guidelines, and the presence of vascular/valvular calcification. Results: The KDIGO targets for P, Ca, and iPTH, were achieved in 47%, 51%, and 18% of the patients with stage 4 + 5 and in 63%, 50%, and 44% of the patients with stage 5D, respectively. The serum PTH level of 18% of the patients with CKD stage 4 + 5 was within the recommended range, while it was higher than the recommended level in other patients. Among patients with CKD stage 5D, the serum PTH level was within, below, and above the recommended range in 44%, 39%, and 17% of the patients, respectively. The frequency of the measurement of the blood levels of Ca, P, and PTH were based on the 2009 KDIGO guidelines in 88% of patients. Forty-six percent of cases were screened for vascular/valvular calcification, 30% of whom had calcification at least in one site. Conclusions: The current status is far from the targets recommended by the current guidelines in the management of CKD-MBD.

N2  - Background. Calcific artheriolopathy (calciphylaxis) is an infrequent but important cause of mortality. It is observed in chronic kidney disease patients with abnormal mineral metabolism and metabolic bone disease. There are also reports of this pathology in patients with obesity and some medications. The presence of calciphylaxis and hemochromatosis in the same patient is exceptional. Indeed, we have not found any other case reported in literature. Case description. A 69-year-old Caucasian male was admitted to hospital because of extremely high serum ferritin levels, jaundice and mottled purpuric lesion on right-leg. Six months before admission a right-leg deep vein thrombosis was diagnose and acenocoumarol treatment started. Lesion became painful and necrotic after few days. Laboratory data showed a normal renal function. Parathyroid hormone, serum calcium and phosphate levels also within the normal range. In addition, genetic study reported a dual hemochromatosis mutation. Treatment with sodium thiosulfate was started but the patient died two months after diagnosis. Conclusions and relevance. Calciphylaxis is a rare but important cause of mortality. Combination of hemochromatosis plus acenocoumarol treatment may be associated with calciphylaxis. We suggest that more studies should be conducted to understand the mechanism of vascular calcification in patients on acenocoumarol treatment.

N2  - Background: Conventional vascular imaging techniques are problematic in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients due to associated risks, invasiveness and imprecision. CT angiography (CTA) is routinely used to assess the vasculature of CKD patients before transplant listing. Ferumoxytol, licensed for iron-deficiency anaemia, was originally developed as an MRI contrast agent and reduces T1 properties of tissue on MRI. Methods: Prospective comparative study of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRA (FeMRA) vs CTA for aortoiliac imaging in kidney transplant (KT) candidates. MRA using ferumoxytol 3mg/kg as intravenous contrast agent was performed in addition to CTA. We also used a specific MRI sequence called StarVIBE to detect vascular calcifications in similar way to CT using contrast-free techniques. Two independent readers assessed the FeMRA/ StarVIBE and a third reader the CTA (gold standard). Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was performed to assess interobserver agreement. Comparisons of lumen diameter, calcification, and signal intensity at predefined vascular sections were performed. For continuous variables, mean differences (and CI) were estimated and Bland-Altman plots of interobserver variability were created. Steady-state images were analyzed using the Horos image viewer (vs3, LGPL-3.0). Results: 28 patients (mean age 68 [SD 15] yr; 58% men; 42% diabetics) undergoing CTA for pre-operative KT candidacy assessment were enrolled. There was excellent intraobserver agreement in assessment of the arterial diameter, vein diameter and calcification (ICC 0.91 [95% CI 079-0.96], 0.89 [0.79-0.94] and 0.95 [0.89-0.98], respectively). There were no significant differences in assessment of the arterial diameter and calcification between FeMRA/StarVIBE and CTA (arterial diameter 1.34 [0.42] vs 1.30 [0.44]cm; p=0.63, area of calcification 0.43 [0.35] vs 0.39 [0.29]mm2; p=0.53, respectively). However, signal intensity and qualitative lumen depiction in the venous vasculature was superior with FeMRA (p<0.001). Conclusions: FeMRA combined with StarVIBE is comparable to CTA for assessment of lumen diameter, calcification and signal intensity in the abdominopelvic arterial vasculature of CKD patients due for KT listing with the significant advantage of improved venous depiction with no nephrotoxicity.

N2  - Background: Our recent studies indicate that activation of the Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) pathway through the ER stress response induced by saturated fatty acids (SFAs) plays a causative role in vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD). we 1) studied a pro-apoptotic CHOP transcription factor that contributes to CKD-dependent medial calcification and 2) identified a novel regulator of ER stress-mediated CHOP expression Methods: 1) To study the smooth muscle cells (SMC)-specific role of CHOP in regulating medial calcification, we generated SMC-specific CHOP conditional transgenic mice and analyzed aortic region of control and SMC-specific CHOP TG mice under CKD (5/6 nephrectomy). 2) To explore a signaling pathway that blocks SFA-induced CHOP expression, we screened a kinase inhibitor library containing >140 compounds by treating human vascular smooth muscle cells with a saturated fatty acid. Results: SMC-specific CHOP transgenic mice developed severe vascular apoptosis and medial calcification under CKD. Protein kinase inhibitor library screening identified 16 compounds, including 7 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, that significantly suppressed the induction of CHOP through ER stress. In addition, selective inhibitors against CDK9 and CDK9-specific inhibition through a gene-editing technique blocked SFA-mediated induction of CHOP, while other CDK isoform inhibitors did not affect CHOP expression. Knockout of cyclin T1 inhibited SFA-mediated induction of CHOP and mineralization, whereas deletion of cyclin T2 and cyclin K promoted CHOP expression levels and mineralization. The CDK9-cyclin T1 complex directly phosphorylated and activated ATF4. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that 1) the CDK9-cyclin T1 and CDK9-cyclin T2/K complexes have opposing roles in CHOP expression and vascular calcification and 2) the CDK9-cyclin T1 complex mediates vascular calcification due to CHOP induction through phosphorylation-mediated ATF4 activation.

N2  - Background: Hyperphosphatemia, common in chronic kidney disease (CKD), is linked to vascular calcification (VC), which further increases cardiovascular risk. Some evidence suggests oral magnesium (Mg) inhibits VC. Fermagate is a calcium-free, magnesium-releasing phosphate binder that controls hyperphosphatemia. This study determined if fermagate treatment compared to untreated control could impact VC in the adenine-induced CKD rat model. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a 0.25% adenine, 0.5% phosphate (PO4) diet to induce CKD (creatinine >250 uM) over 4-5 weeks, then fed 0.5% PO4 without adenine diet. At 6 weeks CKD, two dietary PO4 regimens were tested: moderate PO4 (0.75%P) diet (5g 8AM and 4PM ±fermagate (FER n=9) untreated control (CON n=6), 10g diet overnight, or a combination of high and low PO4 (1-0.5%P): high (1%P 5g 8AM, 4PM ±fermagate) and 10g low (0.5%P) PO4 diet overnight (FER n=8, CON n=10) with the same amount of daily dietary PO4. Serum calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), PO4, FGF-23, parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D metabolome, and tissue Ca and PO4 were determined. Results: In both studies, fermagate increased serum Mg (203% 0.75%P, p<0.0001; 163% 0.5-1%P, p<0.0001, % control, 2-way ANOVA) and had lower levels of serum PO4 (67% 0.75%P, p<0.001; 64% 0.5-1%P, p<0.001), and PTH (31% 0.75%P, p<0.001; 16% 0.5-1%P, p<0.001). The proportion of VC was significantly reduced in arterial tissues with fermagate treatment (79%/65% in CON vs. 35% FER(0.75%P) and 13% FER(0.5-1%P), respectively, p<0.001). This inhibition was also evident on a per animal basis (100%/70% CON had VC vs. 33% FER(0.75%P) and 13%(FER 0.5-1%P), p<0.05, respectively). Fermagate treatment did not significantly alter Mg levels in the vasculature tissue, serum Ca, FGF-23, or serum vitamin D metabolome. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that fermagate effectively reduces the bioavailability of dietary PO4, decreases serum PO4, increases serum Mg, and effectively limits the development and progression of CKD-induced vascular calcification.

N2  - Background: The novel bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) isoform B1x is only detectable in serum from patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) or endstage renal disease. B1x has been proposed as a marker for low bone turnover, furthermore, B1x activity increases in calcifying vascular smooth muscle cells. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) prevent activation of the potent vascular calcification inhibitor matrix Gla protein. VKA is associated with an increased risk for calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy, CUA), a rare and often fatal complication associated with severe calcification of arterioles. The objective was to study the appearance of B1x in serum from CKD patients with CUA. Methods: Seventeen CKD patients with CUA (15 on hemodialysis, 1 transplanted, 1 pre-dialysis) were recruited from the European Calciphylaxis Network. Serum total ALP was determined by a kinetic assay and the BALP isoforms (B/I, B1, B1x and B2) by highperformance liquid chromatography. Fetuin A, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), total BALP (ELISA), C-reactive protein, sclerostin, C-terminal fibroblast growth factor 23, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5b (TRAP5b), osteoprotegerin, 25-OH vitamin D, total calcium (Ca) and phosphate were also assessed. Results: B1x was detected in 10 patients (56%). These patients were more often treated with VKA (7 VKA patients B1x positive, vs 1 VKA patient B1x negative), had a more frequent history of myocardial infarction, lower total ALP (P=0.025), lower BALP (P=0.025), lower BALP isoform B1 (P<0.001) and lower total Ca (P=0.014) in serum. There was a tendency towards lower iPTH and lower TRAP5b (P=0.055 for both). Conclusions: Patients with B1x were more often treated with VKA. Circulating bone markers indicate an association of B1x with low bone turnover. We hypothesize that VKA induce a specific subtype of vascular calcification, which is different from non-VKA-users. Based on the BALP isoform analysis, subgroups of CUA could be identified, which might also reveal differences in terms of bone metabolism.

N2  - Background: Increasing evidence indicate that a complex interplay between reduced renal function, altered bone metabolism and increased levels of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota drives vascular calcification (VC) which causes considerable morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here we investigated if osteoprotegerin (OPG), an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation, is associated with phenylacetylglutamine (PAG), a gut microbial metabolite, and VC in CKD stage 5 patients. Methods: In 112 living donor kidney transplant (LD-Rtx) recipients (63% males; median age 47 years), associations between severity of VC (score 0 to 3; evaluated by histological examination of epigastric artery specimens collected at LD-Rtx), and serum OPG and PAG were investigated. Patients with VC grade 0 (n=17) and 1 (n=51) were combined into Group 1, representing no or minimal VC (n=68), and those having moderate (score 2; n= 29) or extensive (score 3; n= 15) VC were combined into Group 2 (n=44). Results: Group 2 patients had significantly higher OPG levels than Group 1 patients with no or minimal VC. In Spearman's rank correlations, OPG was positively associated with age, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, PAG, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and percentage calcification. Multivariate regression analyses showed that after adjustments for age, sex, diabetes and smoking habits, 1-SD higher level of PAG (β=0.35 P<0.001) was independently associated with 1-SD higher OPG level (adjusted r2=0.44). OPG was significantly associated with VC score after adjustments for age, sex, diabetes, smoking habits and PAG (OR [95% CI]: 2.05 [1.08, 3.89]; p=0.03). Conclusions: While gut microbiome assessed by PAG is closely related with bone metabolism as assessed by OPG in CKD patients, serum OPG is a strong predictor of biopsy-verified VC, independent of gut microbiota status as assessed by PAG.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is a major cause of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). While higher levels of serum phosphorus contribute to VC, but in early CKD patients with normal phosphorus have VC, and reduction of serum P by using various P binder is not effective in preventing VC progression in patients with CKD. So, we think some other factors contribute to VC, especially in Early CKD. Methods: In CKD dialysis patients with VC (n=11) and dialysis CKD patients without VC (n=13), serum 8-OHdG was measured. We use CKD5 and early CKD rats to test the Vascular calcification and Nox1, we also use the serum of early CKD patients to incubate primary VSMCs , SM22α expression and RUNX2 expression, calcium deposition in primary rat VSMCs and Nox1 are measured. Results: In a rat model for the stage 5 CKD (CKD5), robust increases of VC and 8-OHdG, significant reductions of smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM22α) expression, and an upregulation in RUNX2 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were demonstrated. Inhibition of 8-OHdG using MnTMPyP dramatically reduced these events without normalization hyperphosphatemia. In CKD patients with VC (n=11) but not in CKD patients without VC (n=13), 8-OHdG was significantly elevated. While the serum levels of calcium and phosphate were not altered in animal models in the early stage CKD (ECKD), 8-OHdG, VC, SM22α downregulation, RUNX2 upregulation, and NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) expression in VSMCs were all significantly changed. More importantly serum (10%) derived from patients with ECKD (n=30) or CKD5 (n=30) significantly induced SM22α downregulation, RUNX2 upregulation, NOX1 upregulation along with a robust 8-OHdG, and calcium deposition in primary rat VSMCs. These alterations were all reduced by MnTMPyP and a specific NOX1 inhibitor (ML171). Conclusions: Collectively, we provide evidence for an important role of Nox1 in promoting VC development in early CKD patients, which was at least in part through induction of osteoblastic transition in VSMCs.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification is closely associated with cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We previously reported that saturated fatty acids (SFAs) such as stearic acid promote osteoblastic differentiation and mineralization of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We recently found that profound activation of aortic IKKb and NFkB-mediated inflammation occurs in mouse models of vascular calcification such as SMC-specific SCD1/2 knockout mice. However, the pathological relevance of a pro-inflammatory signaling pathway to SFA-mediated vascular calcification in CKD is unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of the IKKb-NFkB pathway in the development of vascular calcification induced by SFAs. Methods: We generated several in vitro models of IKKb-NFkB pathway activation or suppression using a mouse VSMC line, including VSMCs overexpressing constitutively active IKKb (IKKbCA) and IkBa (IKKb deficient) VSMCs (IkBaKO). For in vivo study, we generated SMC-specific IKKb knockout mice by crossing IKKb floxed mice with an SMCspecific Cre transgenic mouse line, SMMHC-Cre(ER)T2, to generate SMC-IKKbKO mice. Results: IKKbCA significantly increased levels of phosphorylated (active) p65, and reduced levels of IkBa protein, a negative regulator of NFkB, resulting in increased expression of NFkB target genes, including IL-6, MCP-1 and iNOS. Importantly, IKKb activation increased the matrix calcium of VSMCs. In addition to IKKbCA, IkBaKO significantly increased expression of NFkB target genes and matrix calcium induced by stearate treatment compared with wild type VSMCs. We next examined whether IKKb inhibition inhibits calcification of VSMCs. shIKKb inhibited stearate-induced up-regulation of NFkB target genes. Unexpectedly, however, IKKb knockdown significantly accelerated stearate-induced vascular calcification. Consistent with the in vitro study, SMC-IKKbKO mice had significantly larger calcified medial lesions under 5/6 nephrectomy. Conclusions: This study suggests that the IKKb-NFkB pathway positively and negatively regulates mineralization of VSMCs.

N2  - Background: It has been reported that brain atrophy (BA) progresses rapidly in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, especially in patients on hemodialysis (HD). We previously demonstrated that BA progressed more rapidly in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) compared with patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD (ND) (Tsuruya K, et al. AJKD, 2015). Vascular calcification (VC) has been considered to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease including cerebrovascular disease; however, it remains unclear whether VC affects BA. Thus, we examined the association between VC and BA by cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses among CKD patients. Methods: In the present study, 157 CKD (90 ND, 42 PD, and 25 HD) patients aged 62 (mean) ± 10 (SD) years (men 91, diabetes 46) were recruited and underwent MRI scanning at baseline and after two years. T1-weighted MRI images were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping software. Total gray matter (GM), total white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were segmented and each volume was quantified using MRI voxel-based morphometry. GM ratio (GMR), calculated by normalization of GM volume to intracranial volume determined by summation of GM, WM, and CSF volume, and annual reduction rate of GMR (ARR-GMR) were used to evaluate BA. At baseline, all participants underwent multidetector computed tomography to assess coronary artery calcification score (CACS) and the values were transformed into the square root values (SR-CACS) to reduce the skewed distribution. We examined the associations of SR-CACS with GMR and ARRGMR using multiple regression analysis. Results: The mean GMR significantly decreased from 40.0‰ at baseline to 39.2‰ after 2 years, and the mean ARR-GMR was 0.38 percentage-point. SR-CACS was significantly negatively associated with GMR and positively associated with ARR-GMR. The association with GMR remained significant even after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin, dialysis status (ND, PD, or HD), current smoking, and regular drinking (Model-1), and the association with ARR-GMR also remained significant even after adjustment for Model-1 and baseline GMR (Model-2). Conclusions: CACS was significantly associated with rapid progression of BA in CKD patients. This study suggests that VC might affect BA.

N2  - Introduction: Oxidative stress has been implicated in the development and progression of vascular calcification (VC). However, this causal association remains a matter of controversy. Objective: To analyze in an experimental model of chronic renal failure (CRF), the effect of oxidative stress on the development and progression of the VC, assessing the implication of microRNA-377 (miR-377). Material and methods: Two groups of Wistar rats with CRF were studied. Group 1 received normal diet in phosphorus (CRF+NP). Group 2 received a high phosphorus (CRF+HP) diet. A group of Sham rats was included. After 20 weeks, the rats were sacrificed. Results: Serum phosphorus and parathormone did not increase in the CRF+HP group compared to CRF+NP, but fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels significantly increased. In the CRF+NP group, aortic calcium content increased three-fold over the Sham group, a 17-fold increase in the CRF+HP group, where the bone mineral density in the proximal tibia decreased significantly. In the CRF+NP group, the expression of miR-377 decreased by 65%, with no additional effect detected of the diet with high phosphorus content. In the CRF+NP group, the protein expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD-2) increased 3-fold, and in the CRF+HP group it increased up to 6-fold. Conclusions: CRF, with or without high phosphorus dietary content, triggered the descent of miR-377. Excess phosphorus increased SOD-2 as a compensatory mechanism to curb oxidative stress and vascular damage. Controlling phosphorus content in the diet when the renal impairment function is compromised will reduce the vascular damage produced due oxidative stress, among other factors.

N2  - Vascular calcification is an important factor causing cardiovascular disorders in patients with chronic kidney disease. Vitamin K is involved in vascular calcification. This study analyzed the effect of vitamin K on vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease while receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Patients with chronic kidney disease receiving hemodialysis in our hospital were recruited. Experimental group received vitamin K treatmentin addition to maintenance dialysis, whereas, control group only received maintenance dialysis. Levels of blood calcium, phosphorus, vitamin K, ALB, ALP, CRP, AOPP and fetuin A were measured. Artery calcification score was calculated to analyze factors regulating vascular calcification anddeterminethe relationship between vitamin K and clinical indexes. Blood calcium, phosphorus, vitamin K, ALB and fetuin A levels were higher in experimental group, which presented lower ALP, CRP, AOPP and artery calcification score (p<0.05) compared with control group. After 1 or 3 months treatment, elevated blood calcium, phosphorus, vitamin K, ALB and fetuin A levels, reduction of ALP, CRP, AOPP and artery calcification score were shown in experimental group (p<0.05 compared with before treatment). High blood calcium, phosphorus, vitamin K, ALB, ALP, CRP, AOPP and elevated fetuin A and vitamin K levels were risk factors causing vascular calcification inpatients with chronic kidney disease while receiving maintenance hemodialysis (p<0.05). Vitamin K was negatively correlated with vascular calcification score (p<0.05). Vitamin K can modulate vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease who receive long-term maintenance hemodialysis.

N2  - Introduction: Apabetalone, an orally active BET inhibitor, reduced incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with CVD and improved eGFR in a subpopulation with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in phase 2 trials. Because vascular calcification (VC) is associated with MACE and is a predictor of all-cause mortality, modulation of processes associated with VC through BET inhibition were examined. Methods: Plasma proteomic profiling was conducted in CVD patients receiving 100 mg of apabetalone b.i.d. in 3 month (ASSERT) and 6 month (SUSTAIN & ASSURE) phase 2 trials, as well as in patients with stage 4 CKD receiving a single 100 mg dose in a phase 1 trial. Cell culture systems were used to examine the effects of apabetalone on expression of VC markers, differentiation of coronary artery VSMCs in osteogenic conditions and extracellular calcium deposition. Results: Apabetalone significantly reduced circulating levels of VC markers in phase 2 trials in CVD patients, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin and osteoprotegerin. Plasma proteomics of CKD patients (n=8) demonstrated activation of molecular pathways driving calcification including “BMP-2 signaling” and “RANK signaling in osteoclasts” versus matched individuals. Both pathways were downregulated by apabetalone 12 hours post dose in the CKD cohort. Mechanistic effects of apabetalone were examined in vitro. In primary human hepatocytes (PHH), apabetalone downregulated ALP expression by 60- 80% and reduced expression of osteopontin in PHH and U937 macrophages. Differentiation of primary human VSMCs with osteogenic conditions induced expression of ALP, osteoprotegerin, RUNX2 and WNT5A, which was opposed by apabetalone. Further, apabetalone dose dependently countered calcium deposition in VSMCs. Conclusions: Apabetalone mediates downregulation of factors and pathways associated with VC. Simultaneous effects on multiple contributing cell types suggest apabetalone may oppose pathologic VC to decrease MACE in patients with high CVD risk. The potential impact of chronic apabetalone treatment on biomarkers, renal function & CVD outcomes in patients with impaired kidney function is currently being studied in a substudy of the phase 3 BETonMACE CVD outcomes trial.

N2  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a progressive loss of renal function and a high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Apabetalone is an orally active BET protein inhibitor that decreased major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in CVD patients in phase 2 clinical trials. Thus, a phase 1, open-label, parallel group study of patients with impaired kidney function was conducted to determine the effect of apabetalone on plasma proteins associated with CVD complications in CKD. Methods: 8 subjects with stage 4 CKD not on dialysis (mean eGFR=20 ml/ min/1.73m2) and 8 matched controls (mean eGFR=78.5 ml/min/1.73m2) received a single 100 mg dose of apabetalone. Plasma was collected over 48h for PK analysis and at 12h post dose for proteomics analysis using the SOMAscan® platform (1305 proteins). Data were analysed with Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®) to identify pathways regulated by apabetalone. Results: PK parameters were similar in CKD patients and controls. Plasma proteomics in CKD patients showed that after 12h apabetalone altered levels of 261 proteins by 10-58% (p<0.05), versus baseline. 257/261 proteins were downregulated, consistent with inhibition of BET sensitive genes. IPA® revealed a robust effect of apabetalone on pathways involved in immunity and inflammation, acute phase response, diabetes, endothelial dysfunction, vascular calcification, fibrosis, and hypertension. Apabetalone also reduced circulating CKD and CVD markers, including IL-6, TNFα, IL-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CRP, PAI-1, L-selectin, E-selectin, MMP-3, MMP-10, fibronectin and SPP1 (p<0.05). Conclusions: In stage 4 CKD patients, apabetalone rapidly downregulates plasma markers and molecular pathways linked to renal disease and CVD complications. The long term impact of apabetalone is currently being studied in a subpopulation with impaired kidney function of the phase 3 BETonMACE CVD outcomes trial.

N2  - Background: Hyperphosphatemia and vascular calcification(VC) are frequent complications of chronic renal failure(CRF). BMP7 has been shown to protect against development of VC in uremia. Thus the potential reversibility of established VC was examined in two experimental models; 1. by studying if BMP7 treatment could reduce the degree of VC in uremia and 2. by isogenic transplantation(ATx) of the calcified aorta from uremic rats to healthy littermates. Methods: CRF and VC was induced in adult DA-rats by 5/6 nephrectomy, high phosphate(P) diet and alfacalcidol treatment. After 14 wks, severe VC was present. In model 1, CRF rats were allocated either to 250μg/kg of BMP7 ip once weekly or vehicle for 8 wks. In model 2, the abdominal aorta was transplanted orthotopically from CRF rats to healthy littermates. Ctrl group had normal to normal ATx. Rats were sacrificed 4 wks after ATx. Results: BMP7 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of plasma P from 2.06±0.14 to 1.56±0.07mmol/L, p<0.01, despite persistent uremia. Uremia induced increase in aortic expression of fibronectin 1.15±0.11, periostin 1.31±0.14 and activin-A 1.34±0.06, and BMP7 treatment resulted in a significant decrease; Fn1 0.82±0.09, Postn 0.91±0.09, Inhiba 0.97±0.11, p<0.05. In the BMP7 study Ca content was significantly increased in the uremic vehicle treated rats both in the distal abdominal aorta 1.9±0.2μg/ mg and in the proximal thoracic aorta 71±11μg/mg, and similar levels were seen in the BMP7 treated rats; 2.2±0.2μg/mg in the distal abdominal aorta and 54±7μg/mg in the proximal thoracic aorta. In the ATx study Ca content of the aorta from uremic rats was significantly elevated to 17.0±0.2μg/mg in the proximal abdominal aorta and similarly increased in the transplanted uremic aorta 15.9±0.6μg/mg, confirming that established uremic VC is not reversible despite removal of the uremic milieu. Conclusions: BMP7 treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of procalcific genes and a siginificant decrease in plasma P. Despite these favorable changes no effect on aortic Ca content was seen. These results were confirmed in the ATx study, where complete reversal of the uremic mileu neither reversed established uremic VC.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is frequently accompanied with bone loss in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). WNT regulates osteoblast activation through canonical (β-catenin dependent) and non-canonical (-independent) signaling pathways, but a common pathophysiology between the pathways during VC and bone loss still remained a conundrum. Therefore, we hypothesized that VC results from phenotypic conversion of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) into an osteoblast-like cell involves induction of an osteoblast transcriptional program via a non-canonical WNT pathway, while bone loss is mainly regulated by canonical WNT pathway. Methods: Adenine-induced CKD animal model with VC was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats fed 0.75% adenine (2.5% protein, 0.92% phosphate) and intraperitoneal calcitriol (0.08 μl/kg/day) injection for 4 weeks. In an angiotensin II (3μM)-induced VC in high phosphate milieu (3mM) through its effect on VSMC, the effect of WNT signaling on VC was determined by expression of osteoblastic transcriptional factor (RUNX2), Von Kossa stain and WNT downstream signaling factors. Results: In mRNA profiler PCR assay of WNT signaling pathway from animal model, secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4) were increased, while sFRP5 was decreased than those of control group fed with normal rat chow (0.62% phosphate). From the in vitro study, the protective effect of sFRP5 on VSMC differentiation was mediated through the inhibition of Rho/ROCK and JNK pathways. Moreover, the effect of Rho/ROCK and JNK pathways on sFRP5 repression through VSMC differentiation were aggravated by anisomycin (JNK activator), whereas recovered with SP600125 (JNK inhibitor). Those expressions of RUNX2 and WNT signaling factors in adenine-induced CKD animal model with VC showed in the similar patterns. Conclusions: Our study suggests that loss of sFRP5 was associated with VC in CKD environment by activating non-canonical WNT pathway, which indicate that sFRP5 may be a new therapeutic target in VC in CKD environment.

N2  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with mineral and bone disorder (MBD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) contribute to these complications and their tissue accumulation can be indirectly measured through skin autofluorescence (sAF) by AGE-ReaderTM. Methods: To investigate the relations between AGEs intake, tissue and serum AGEs levels with CVD and MBD parameters in CKD patients stages 3-4 and in peritoneal dialysis (PD), clinical and observational study with healthy subjects (N=37) and patients distributed in 2 groups: CKD stages 3-4 (N=20) and PD (N=28). Clinical and laboratorial parameters, ankle-brachial index (ABI), AGEs-sAF levels and AGEs intake were analyzed. In addition, CKD patients performed hip, hands and lateral abdomen radiographs for investigation of vascular calcification (VC), echocardiogram, bone densitometry and serum carboxymethyllysine (CML) levels assay. Results: AGEs-sAF was increased in CKD 3-4 and PD patients compared to the healthy subjects (3.05±0.6 vs. 2.4±0.4; p<0.05), despite similar AGEs intake (10.118±4.760 vs. 11.942±5.581; p>0.05). There are no differences in AGEs-sAF levels between CKD3-4 and PD patients (3.04±0.6 vs. 3.06±0.7; p=0.9); AGEs-sAF levels were positively correlated with interventricular septum (R=0.36; p=0.02), age (R=0.56; p=0.0001) and negatively correlated with the T score from bone densitometry (R=-0.36; p=0.03). In addition, AGEs-sAF levels were higher in patients with VC [N=14 (31%)] (3.4±0.5 vs. 2.8±0.5; p=0.01) and among patients with osteoporosis (3.2±0.8 vs. 2.6±0.4; p=0.04). Conclusions: CKD stages 3-4 and PD patients have increased AGEs-sAF levels, which can be measured non-invasively with the AGE-ReaderTM. AGEs tissue accumulation might play a role on development of VC and osteoporosis in CKD patients.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and increases the risk of cardiovascular deaths. PiT-2 is a type III sodiumdependent phosphate (Pi) transporter expressed in various tissues and a causative gene for familial basal ganglion arterial calcification. However, it is unknown whether PiT-2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of VC related to CKD. Methods: To determine the role of PiT-2 in VC, wild-type (WT) and global PiT-2 heterozygous (HET) knockout mice were challenged with CKD. At two weeks after the two-step 5/6th nephrectomy, mice were fed a normal (0.5%) or high (1.5%) Pi diet for 11 days and terminated. At termination, blood, aorta, kidney, and femur were collected. Serum chemistry, histology, and micro CT analyses were performed. Primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) isolated from the aortas of WT and PiT-2 HET mice were used for in vitro Pi-induced calcification and P-uptake assays. WT-derived VSMCs were also treated with scramble or PiT-2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and used for gene and protein expression analysis. Results: Uremic mice fed a high Pi diet developed VC in the medial layer of the aorta, which was exemplified by Alizarin red staining and calcium quantification of the blood vessel. PIT-2 haploinsufficiency greatly enhanced VC in the setting of CKD and high Pi diet. No differences were observed in the serum levels of calcium, Pi, and FGF23, kidney function, and renal mRNA expression of SLC34A1 and SLC34A3 between the WT and PiT-2 HET mice with CKD. MicroCT analyses showed that haploinsufficiency of PiT-2 decreased trabecular bone mineral density and thickness in CKD. In vitro, Pi uptake activity was decreased in the cultured VSMCs isolated from the PiT-2 HET mice compared with those from the WT mice. Under high Pi medium condition, PiT-2 haploinsufficiency increased calcification of the cultured VSMCs. Similar results were also found in WT VSMCs treated with PiT-2 siRNA. Finally, mRNA expression and protein levels of osteoprotegerin, an inhibitor of VC, were decreased in VSMCs treated with PiT-2 siRNA compared to scramble controls. Conclusions: PiT-2 plays a protective role in the pathogenesis of VC and bone disorders in CKD mice, and can be a promising therapeutic target in the CKD population.

N2  - Background: Different studies, including our own, have shown that hypoxiainducible factor-1 (HIF-1) enhances vascular calcification. However, HIF-1's role in chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related bone disease is currently unknown. The aim of this study is to determine bone HIF-1 expression in chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats with vascular calcification. Methods: CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy and vascular calcification by a supplement of calcium, phosphorus and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Ca/P/VitD). Three groups were studied: control (n=8), CKD (n=14) and CKD + Ca/P/VitD (n=12). At 2 months, tibia bone and thoracic aorta were harvested for micro-CT, histomorphometry and vascular calcification quantification. HIF-1α expression, the essential HIF-1 subunit, was assessed in the tibia by immunohistochemistry and quantified using ImageJ. Results: Vascular calcification occurred only in CKD + Ca/P/VitD rats. Compared to controls, CKD and CKD + Ca/P/VitD rats presented with a lower bone volume and bone mineral content, while trabecular thickness and separation were significantly increased in the CKD+Ca/P/vitD group. Osteoid volume and surface were also increased in CKD + Ca/P/VitD rats, which is compatible with a mineralisation defect (low turnover and mineralisation parameters). HIF-1α was expressed in osteocytes. Interestingly, the proportion of positive osteocytes for HIF-1α was decreased in CKD and CKD+Ca/P/vitD rats as compared to the controls (respectively 63.01 ± 16.78% vs 60.91 ± 23.17% vs 89.31 ± 5.87% in controls, p<0.01) Conclusions: Our study is the first to describe HIF-1 expression in bone from CKD rats with vascular calcification. Since HIF-1 was previously suggested to play a role in bone formation, these results suggest that lower osteocyte HIF-1 expression could be involved in the development of bone anomalies during CKD.

N2  - Background: CKD-MBD includes bone alterations (remodeling/mineralization), biochemical, (calcium, phosphorus, 25-OH-vitamin D, parathormone), and presence of extra bone calcifications. It is not completely known the epidemiology of MBD-CKD in México. Aim: To determinate the prevalence of MBD-CKD in our country. Methods: Cross-sectional analytical study, performed in 333 patients with diagnosis of Chronic Kidney Disease with renal function replacement therapy whit hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, between January of 2014-June of 2016. There was no distinction between gender or causes of CKD. The comparisons were performed with c2 or Student's T. A p value <0.05 was considered adequate. Results: Fifty one percent (n 168) was men, 38% in hemodialysis and 62% in peritoneal dialysis. The prevalence of vascular calcification was 48%; hyperparathyroidism (PTH >300 pg/mL) was 62%, and the prevalence of deficiency of vitamin D (<15 ng/ml) was 27%. Conclusions: The prevalence of vascular calcification was similar to the results of other national studies. The prevalence of hyperparathyroidism was close to two thirds. The deficiency of vitamin D was just in one of each four patients. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) impairs phosphate (PO4) homeostasis resulting in hyperphosphatemia, which is associated with cardiovascular events and vascular calcification (VC). Animal models of CKD demonstrate pathologies and outcomes similar to those of CKD patients. We examined the impact of dietary phosphate loading on markers of mineral metabolism in controlled adenine-induced CKD. Methods: Sprague Dawley rats were fed a 0.25% adenine, 0.5% PO4 diet for 4-5 weeks to induce stable CKD (creatinine >250 uM), then fed 0.5% PO4 diet without adenine. At 5.5 weeks, rats were fed either s 0.5%, 1% or 1.5% PO4 diet, N=9, 10, 6, while another group (N=21) was fed increasing dietary PO4 every 4 days (0.5%→0.75%→1%→1.5%). Controls were fed 0.5% PO4 diet (N=8). Serum calcium (Ca), PO4, FGF-23, PTH, and tissue Ca and PO4 were determined. Results: At 5 weeks, CKD rats vs control had 3.2±0.6 vs 2.5±0.3 mM PO4 and 2.8±0.2 vs 2.4±0.1 mM Ca. Off adenine, the 0.5% group was at control PO4 levels but had elevated Ca at 6.5 weeks. At 7 weeks, the 1.0 and 1.5% groups had marked increases in PO4, PTH, and FGF-23, while serum Ca dropped (table 1). VC was observed in 80% of high PO4 rats (1 or 1.5%). In the increasing dietary PO4 group, serum PO4 (mM) increased with dietary PO4: baseline(2.1±.3), 0.5%(2.7±0.7), 1%(4.2±0.5), 1.5%(4.8±1.3) PO4. Fasting serum Ca (mM) increased in CKD rats given 0.5% PO4 (2.1±0.2→3.1±0.3), but significantly declined when fed 1%(2.4±0.7) and 1.5%(2.2±0.9) dietary PO4. PTH and FGF-23 both increased (4x, 2x) with the increased dietary PO4 and VC was observed in all rats. Conclusions: In our CKD model, 0.5% PO4 diet increased serum Ca but did not induce VC. In contrast, dietary PO4 of 1% or more led to significant decreases in serum Ca, but generated high serum PO4, FGF-23, PTH and VC. These findings uncover a new link between dietary PO4 and serum Ca.

N2  - Objective: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Studies have shown an association between aortic stiffness, a non-traditional risk factor, and high rate of mortality in CKD patients. Using a CKD animal model with vascular calcification, we reported that interleukin-6 (IL-6) may be involved in the process of vascular calcification. Therefore, the aims of the study were 1) to investigate the association between IL-6 and aortic stiffness and 2) to evaluate the impact of IL-6 on mortality in CKD patients. Design and method: In this observational study, we enrolled 351 CKD patients on dialysis (226 on hemodialysis (HD), 56 with peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 69 before kidney transplantation (KTx)). Aortic stiffness and its hemodynamic complications were determined non-invasively by the assessment of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), augmentation index (Aix) and central pulse pressure (PP). Interleukin-6 was measured in plasma by ELISA. Survival analysis was performed on 282 HD and PD patients using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression after a median follow-up of 38 months. Results: Interleukin-6 was positively associated with aortic stiffness adjusted for mean blood pressure determined by cf-PWV (Standardized b = 0.270; P < 0.001), AIx (Standardized b = 0.224; P < 0.001) and central PP (Standardized b = 0.147; P = 0.003). In a multivariate linear regression model adjusted for age, diabetes, hypertension, CVD, smoking and mean blood pressure, IL-6 was still positively associated with cf-PWV (Standardized b = 0.090; P = 0.037). During follow-up, 192 deaths occurred. The group of patients with higher levels of IL-6 had a hazard ratio for mortality of 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3-2.3; P < 0.001). Adjustment for clinical cofounders (age, CVD, hypertension, diabetes and smoking) did not change the relationship (HR = 1.426; 95% CI:1.06-1.92; P = 0.019). The impact of IL-6 on mortality decreased when adding cf-PWV (HR = 1.388; 95% CI:1.03-1.87; P = 0.032) in the previous model suggesting that the detrimental role of IL-6 on mortality may involve aortic stiffness. Conclusions: This study reveals a positive relationship between IL-6, aortic stiffness and mortality in CKD patients. Our results, together with our previous findings in an experimental animal model, indicated that IL-6 may represents a novel therapeutic target of CKD-related-CVD.

N2  - Background: Around 8-10% of the adult population suffers from kidney damage, and the death rate of complications related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still high. The leading cause of death is cardiovascular complications at which vascular calcification (VC) is prevailing in CKD patients. Aim: This systematic review analyzed original research papers on uremic toxins and vascular calcification and determined which uremic toxins affect vascular calcification processes. Methods: The authors performed a PubMed literature search to identify eligible studies. A combination of the search terms “chronic kidney disease”, “uremia”, “end-stage renal disease”, “dialysis”, “chronic renal failure”, “chronic kidney failure”, “vascular calcification”, “calcification”, “uremic toxin(s)”, “uremic retention solute(s)”, “cardio-renal toxin(s)”, “cardiovascular toxin(s)”, “toxin(s)” was used. The systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database, and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Results: The literature search resulted in 92 papers. After removing non- English and review articles, the titles and abstracts of the remaining 50 papers were screened by two reviewers. The remaining 36 papers were given a full-text examination and 33 papers identified as relevant for narrative synthesis. Altogether 43 solutes were studied: 20 low- and 14 middle molecular weight, 7 protein bound uremic toxins and 6 other solutes/factors. In 22 cases no significant effect on VC processes was revealed (e.g. calcium, creatinine, and urea); 17 solutes were found to have inducers of VC (e.g. phosphate, indoxyl sulphate and beta-2 microglobulin) and 7 substances inhibited VC processes (e.g. paricalcitol and drugs AST-120 and Sevelamer). Conclusion: Researching the effect of uremic toxins on VC gives valuable information which toxins levels should be reduced in CKD patients and gives hints to the developers of dialysis techniques. Since the effect of many solutes on VC is still not analyzed, there is a need for further research.

N2  - Introduction: Medial vascular calcification is an active process mainly regulated by vascular smooth muscle cells. In chronic kidney disease, hyperphosphatemia triggers vascular calcification, which underlies the high cardiovascular mortality of these patients. Purpose: Investigate the role of the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) during vascular calcification. Methods/Results: In primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMCs), triggers of vascular calcification increased SGK1 expression. SGK1 expression was increased in aortas from animal models of vascular calcification and in coronary artery biopsies of patients with renal disease. Silencing and pharmacological inhibition of SGK1 ameliorated phosphate-induced osteo-/chondrogenic reprogramming and vascular calcification in-vitro. Similarly, genetic Sgk1-deficiency blunted phosphate-induced calcification in primary mouse aortic smooth muscle cells. Transfection of a constitutively active SGK1, but not inactive SGK1, was sufficient to induce osteo-/chondrogenic reprogramming in HAoSMCs. Constitutively active SGK1 increased NF-kB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Pharmacological NF-kB inhibition or silencing of IKK prevented the osteoinductive effects of constitutively active SGK1. Vascular calcification and osteo- /chondrogenic reprogramming was blunted in aortas of Sgk1-deficient mice after cholecalciferol-overload. Renal failure by 5/6 nephrectomy triggered vascular calcification and osteo-/chondrogenic reprogramming in ApoE-deficient mice, effects ameliorated by Sgk1-deficiency. Conclusions: SGK1 is a key regulator of vascular calcification by regulating NFkB activity. Inhibition of SGK1 may be a clinically feasible strategy to prevent vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease.

N2  - Introduction: Apabetalone is a first-in-class orally active bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitor associated with a reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) from phase 2 clinical trials. Apabetalone has previously been shown to downregulate markers of atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation, which may explain its effects on MACE. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a progressive loss of renal function and a high risk of CVD. Purpose: To determine the effect of apabetalone on levels of circulating proteins and pathways that contribute to cardiovascular complications in CKD, in a phase 1, open-label, parallel group study of patients with impaired kidney function. Methods: Eight subjects with stage 4 CKD not on dialysis (mean eGFR=20 ml/min/1.73m2) and eight age-, gender-, and BMI-matched subjects (mean eGFR=78.5 ml/min/1.73m2) received a single 100 mg oral dose of apabetalone. Plasma samples were collected at multiple time points over a period of 48 hours for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and at 12 hours post dose for proteomic analysis using the SOMAscan® 1.3K platform. Proteomics data were analysed with Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to identify pathways dysregulated in CKD patients compared to matched controls, and the effect of apabetalone treatment on those pathways. Results: Apabetalone PK parameters were similar in controls and CKD patients. At baseline, plasma proteomics showed enrichment of markers that correlate with progression of CKD, as compared to matched controls, including cystatin C and b2 microglobulin (3-fold and 5-fold enrichment, respectively, p<0.001). Accordingly, pathway analysis of CKD plasma proteome at baseline showed an upregulation of pathways that underlie CVD in CKD patients such as the inflammatory response, atherosclerosis, thrombosis and calcification, when compared to controls. These pathways were robustly and significantly downregulated in CKD patients by apabetalone 12h post dose. In the CKD group, apabetalone treatment also reduced the abundance of circulating CVD markers involved in vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis, fibrosis, vascular calcification, complement activation and hemostasis including CRP, IL-6, TNFα, IL-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, Lselectin, E-selectin, MMP-3, MMP-10, fibronectin, osteopontin, C3 and C5 active fragments, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, D-dimer and P-selectin (p<0.05). Conclusions: In stage 4 CKD patients, a single oral dose of apabetalone rapidly reduces circulating markers and molecular pathways linked to progression of renal disease and accompanying CVD complications. The potential impact of chronic treatment with apabetalone on biomarkers, renal function and CVD outcomes in patients with impaired kidney function is currently being studied in a subpopulation of the phase 3 BETonMACE CVD outcomes trial.

N2  - Introductions. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a main cause of mortality and morbidity in chronic kidney patients (CKD). Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) is a member of the TNF superfamily that regulate, cell death, cell proliferation, inflammation and cell differentiation. TWEAK is constitutively present in the kidney. Cells can express both full-length sTWEAK (Soluble TWEAK) and mTWEAK (membrane-anchored TWEAK). Soluble TWEAK increases the secretion and expression of various proteins that involved in the inflammatory response. Methods. Inflammatory response. Recent studies demonstrate the role of soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) weak inducer of apoptosis (sTWEAK) as a marker of cardiovascular disease in CKD patients and suggest a role for sTWEAK in the pathophysiology of vascular calcification and sTWEAK could be a novel biomarker of atherosclerotic in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Newly, sTWEAK was presented as a possible biomarker which is downregulated in atherosclerosis. Results. Atherosclerosis. Reduced sTWEAK levels follow declining of renal function, are strongly associated with endothelial dysfunction that predict cardiovascular events in nondialyzed chronic kidney disease patients. In contrast, elevated levels of sTWEAK predict poor survival in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Conclusions. Circulating soluble TWEAK (sTWEAK) levels are a possible biomarker of adverse outcomes in CKD and can be a new biomarker of cardiovascular diseases well as cardiovascular outcome in CKD patients. Current preclinical data indicate that sTWEAK may provide diagnostic information and can be a therapeutic target in renal injury. Its role in human kidney disease should be further explored.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a progressive loss of renal function and a high risk of cardiovascular complications that lead to unfavorable outcomes in nearly half of patients. Apabetalone is a first-in-class orally active bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibitor (BETi) associated with a reduction in major adverse cardiac events in phase 2 clinical trials in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, apabetalone was studied in a phase 1, open-label, parallel group study to examine single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) and levels of CKD markers in patients with impaired renal function. METHODS: Eight subjects with stage 4 CKD not on dialysis (mean eGFR=20 ml/min/ 1.73m2) and eight age-, gender-, and BMI-matched subjects (mean eGFR=78.5 ml/ min/1.73m2) received a single 100 mg oral dose of apabetalone. Plasma samples from participants were collected at multiple time points over a period of 48 hours for PK analysis and at 12 hours post dose for proteomic analysis using the SOMAscan® 1.3K platform. Proteomics data were analysed with Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to identify the top pathways dysregulated in CKD patients compared to healthy subjects, and the effect of apabetalone treatment on those pathways. RESULTS: PK parameters, including mean Cmax, AUClast, and t1=2, were similar in healthy subjects and CKD patients, with median tmax at 4h in both groups. At baseline, plasma proteomics showed enrichment of markers known to correlate with disease progression in CKD patients, as compared to matched controls, including cystatin C and b2 microglobulin (3-fold and 5-fold enrichment, respectively, p<0.001). Accordingly, pathway analysis of CKD plasma proteome at baseline confirmed an upregulation of pathways known to be activated in CKD such as the inflammatory response, immune response, thrombosis, calcification and oxidative stress, compared to controls. These pathways were robustly and highly significantly downregulated in CKD patients by apabetalone at 12h post dose. Apabetalone treatment also downregulated the abundance of circulating CKD biomarkers involved in vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, acute phase response, coagulation and vascular calcification, including IL-6, TNFα, IL-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CRP, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and osteopontin (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In stage 4 CKD patients, a single oral dose of apabetalone rapidly reduces circulating markers and molecular pathways linked to progression of renal disease and accompanying CVD complications. The potential long term impact of apabetalone on biomarkers, renal function and CVD outcomes in patients with impaired kidney function is currently being studied in a subpopulation of the phase 3 BETonMACE CVD outcomes trial.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Vascular calcification (VC) is a complex process depending on the presence of systemic and local calcification inhibitors, highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The identification of a fetuin-A-containing mineral complex, or calciprotein particle (CPP), highlighted a possible mechanism to prevent systemic mineralization. Nevertheless, the composition and pathophysiological significance of circulating CPPs associated to CKD remains elusive. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are novel players in pathological VC, although their potential use as VC biomarkers is still unknown. GRP is a novel inhibitor of cardiovascular calcification, shown to be involved in the mineralization-competence of VSMCs-derived EVs. Our aim is to investigate the association of GRP with CPP formation and circulating EVs, and study the pathogenic effect of CKD CPPs and EVs in vascular calcification. METHODS: Biological CPPs and EVs were isolated from healthy (CTR) and CKD patients by differential centrifugation and ultracentrifugation, and characterized in terms of protein and mineral content using ultrastructural, analytical, molecular and immuno-based techniques. To evaluate the effect of CPPs and EVs in vascular calcification, different variations of CKD5 and CTR sera combined with isolated CPPs and EVs, were used to culture primary vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in calcifying conditions. Mineralization was evaluated through calcium quantification and qPCR for gene expression analysis. RESULTS: Our results showed that CPPs derived from CKD stage 5 (CKD5) serum contain lower levels of the mineralization inhibitors fetuin-A and GRP, and increased maturation of the mineral crystals. CKD5 EVs were loaded with decreased levels of fetuin-A and GRP while increased annexin VI. Increased mineralization of VSMCs cultured in CKD5 serum was inhibited when CPPs and EVs were removed, and supplementation of CTR depleted CPPs and EVs sera with isolated CKD5 CPPs and EVs induced mineralization. Uremic CPPs and EVs alter VCMCs calcification by modulating cell differentiation and inflammation. Incubation of CKD5 CPPs with cGRP abolished calcification promoted by CKD5 CPPs. CONCLUSIONS: CPPs and EVs are important players in the mechanisms of widespread calcification occurring in CKD, with a preponderant role for GRP. Decreased levels of mineralization inhibitors, such as GRP and fetuin-A leading to the formation of a more crystalline mineral in CPP, and to a decreased mineralization inhibitory capacity of EVs, are most likely major factors responsible for the CPPs and EVs toxicity. GRP is shown to be a crucial component in calcification inhibitory mechanisms, and we propose a biomarker utility for this protein to assess an individual's calcific risk.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Apabetalone, an orally active bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitor, reduced incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with CVD and improved eGFR in a subpopulation with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in phase 2 trials. In CKD patients, vascular calcification (VC) increases CVD risk & is a predictor of all-cause mortality. The process of VC involves differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into osteoblast-like cells resulting in altered gene expression, loss of contractility & extracellular mineralization. Here we report clinical effects of apabetalone on circulating levels of factors involved in VC, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an enzyme regulating pyrophosphate levels & contributing to calcium deposition. Circulating ALP is derived primarily from liver, & elevated ALP is associated with mortality in CKD or patients on dialysis. In vitro, cell systems demonstrate effects of apabetalone on expression of VC markers, differentiation of coronary artery VSMCs & pathological process of extracellular calcium deposition. METHODS: Effects of apabetalone on expression of osteogenic markers were investigated in primary human hepatocytes (PHH), human macrophages (U937), and primary human VSMCs. Extracellular calcium deposition induced by osteogenic culture conditions was measured in VSMCs. Proteomic assessment of plasma from a phase 1 trial in CKD patients receiving a single 100 mg oral dose of apabetalone was conducted using IngenuityVR Pathway Analysis. Proteins associated with VC were also assessed in plasma of CVD patients receiving apabetalone in 3 month (ASSERT) and 6 month (SUSTAIN & ASSURE) phase 2 trials. RESULTS: Factors involved in the process of VC are derived from multiple cell types. In PHH cells from multiple donors, ALP was downregulated 60-80% by apabetalone. Apabetalone also reduced expression of osteopontin, another established marker of VC, in PHH, VSMCs & U937 macrophages. Differentiation of primary VSMCs with osteogenic conditions induced expression of ALP, osteoprotegerin, RUNX2 & WNT5A, which was suppressed by apabetalone. Further, apabetalone dose dependently countered calcium deposition in VSMCs. Clinical trials support translational mechanisms investigated in vitro. Proteomic analysis of plasma from stage 4 CKD patients (n=8) demonstrated significant activation of pathways driving calcification including “BMP-2 signaling” and “RANK signaling in osteoclasts” versus age, gender & BMI matched individuals (n=8). Both pathways were downregulated by apabetalone 12 hours after a single dose. Apabetalone also significantly reduced circulating levels of proteins associated with VC in phase 2 trials in CVD patients, including ALP, osteopontin & osteoprotegerin. CONCLUSIONS: Apabetalone mediates reduction of factors & pathways associated with VC. Simultaneous effects on multiple contributing elements from a variety of cell types suggest apabetalone may decrease pathologic calcification in CKD & contribute to a reduction in MACE in patients with high CVD risk. The potential of apabetalone to reduce CVD in CKD patients is currently being explored in a subpopulation of the phase 3 BETonMACE cardiovascular outcomes trial in patients with established CVD and diabetes mellitus.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Cardiovascular calcification mediated by damaged endothelium with defect in nitrogen oxide system in patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, development of the criteria for early diagnosis of ectopic calcification is an important task of modern nephrology. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the informative value and to determine the threshold levels of endothelial dysfunction indices to diagnose cardiac valve calcification (CVC) and carotid artery calcification (CAC) in patients with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD 5D). METHODS: The study included 94 patients with CKD 5D, who were on hemodialysis (HD) (male, 52; age, 46.4±1.2 years; HD duration, 28.9±3.3 months). Patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (47.9%) dominated. All subjects underwent ultrasound examination to identify the CVC and CAC using standardized approaches. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDVD) of brachial artery (BA) was determined by Celermajer-Sorensen test results, plasma content of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) - according to the method (Hladovec J., 1978) in our modification. Accuracy analysis of diagnostic method was performed using ROC analysis: construction of characteristic curve based on the values & #8203;& #8203;of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: CVC and CAC was detected in 44.7% and 44.7% of HD patients. The significant ROC curves and optimal cut-off values of levels of desquamated endotheliocytes and flow-mediated dilation of BA for the diagnosis of CVC and CAC in patients with CKD 5D are presented in table below. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of the study show high informative value of proposed tests for the diagnosis of cardiovascular calcification in CKD 5D, demonstrate good quality for discrimination of HD patients with presence/absence of CVC and CAC.

N2  - Differentiating between high and low bone turnover in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is essential; both have serious complications yet polarised management strategies. We present a case of a 59-year-old man with recurrent fractures in the context of end stage renal disease, secondary to lupus nephritis with failed renal transplantation, renal calculi, vascular calcification and severe dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient developed lupus nephritis at age 21, requiring intermittent high dose corticosteroids. At age 27, he required a total hip replacement (THR) for left hip avascular necrosis. At age 39, bone scan revealed rib and clavicle fractures. As renal function declined, calcitriol was used to control hyperparathyroidism; this was complicated by renal calculi with brittle calcium and phosphate control. At age 40, he commenced dialysis, before receiving a cadaveric renal transplant at age 45. This was complicated by post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and graft failure, and he returned to dialysis at age 54. At the time of transplantation, bone mineral density (BMD) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry revealed osteoporosis and he commenced alendronate. Subsequent BMD improved, but alendronate dosing was reduced due to biochemical evidence of low bone turnover. He then sustained a left peri-prosthetic fracture following a fall from standing height. When he returned to dialysis, alendronate was ceased and concurrent hypogonadism was treated with testosterone replacement. He continued fracturing, with 2 unprovoked lumbar vertebral fractures and a right atypical femoral fracture. Imaging also revealed severe vascular calcifications. Right total hip BMD was osteopenic. Biochemistry suggested low bone turnover, with parathyroid hormone 7.1pmol/L, alkaline phosphatase 73U/L, calcium 2.42 mmol/L and phosphate 0.84 mmol/L. His fractures were managed conservatively and with changes to his dialysate and calcitriol cessation, his biochemistry improved. We present a case of recurrent fractures due to low bone turnover in CKD and discuss the optimal management to reduce the associated complications.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with mineral and bone disorder (MBD), which is the main cause of the extensively increased cardiovascular mortality in the CKD population. We now aimed to establish a new murine experimental CKD-MBD model. Dilute brown non-Agouti (DBA/2) mice were fed with high-phosphate diet for 4 (HPD4) or 7 (HPD7) days, then with standard chow diet (SCD) and subsequently followed until day 84. They were compared to DBA/2 mice maintained on SCD during the whole study period. Both 4 and 7 days HPD-fed mice developed phosphate nephropathy with tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and increased serum urea levels. The abdominal aorta of HPD-treated mice showed signs of media calcification. Histomorphometric analysis of HPD-treated mice showed decreased bone volume/tissue volume, low mineral apposition rate, and low bone formation rate as compared to SCD-fed mice, despite increased parathyroid hormone levels. Overall, the observed phenotype was more pronounced in the HPD7 group. In summary, we established a new, noninvasive, and therefore easy to perform reproducible CKD-MBD model, which showed media calcification, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and low-turnover bone disease.

N2  - Background: Sevelamer is a phosphate binder widely used in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Sevelamer, as well as other resin-based binders, can crystallize leading to the formation of concretions. Sevelamer crystals (SC) have been associated with gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal injury. We describe three new cases of GI lesions associated with SC and review previously reported cases. Methods: We describe three new cases of GI lesions associated with SC and review previously reported cases. Results: We found 16 previously reported cases of SC-induced GI lesions. The mean patient age was 61 years (interquartile range 51.5-71.75), 62.5% were females and 10 patients were diabetic. In 13 cases, SC was found inside the GI mucosa. Six patients had history of major abdominal surgery. GI bleeding was the most common clinical symptom (n ¼ 7), with three patients presenting with acute abdomen requiring surgical intervention. Although, SC-induced lesions were observed in all GI segments, intestine was involved in 81% of the cases. Endoscopic examination revealed mainly erosions and ulcerations (n ¼ 7) and pseudoinflammatory polyps (n ¼ 5). No association between sevelamer doses and the severity of GI lesions was found. However, diabetics patients seemed to develop GI lesions with smaller doses of sevelamer as compared with non-diabetic patients, in spite of their fewer GI comorbidities. Conclusions: SC-induced GI lesions should be considered in CKD patients treated with sevelamer who present GI symptoms, especially lower GI bleeding, once other causes have been ruled out. Diabetics seem more prone to develop SC-associated GI lesions. Sevelamer therapy should be avoided if possible in patients with a history of major abdominal surgery or chronic constipation, because of the high risk of serious GI complications.

N2  - Vascular calcification (VC) is a common and serious cardiovascular complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Aldosterone (Ald) plays a vital role in regulating cardiovascular function. It is known that patients with CKD suffer from hyperaldosteronism, suggesting Ald might regulate the development of VC in CKD. However, the role of endogenous Ald in the pathogenesis of VC in CKD is still unclear. In this study, we employed a model of adenine (ADN)-induced CKD in rats. The results showed that ADN-fed rats exhibited CKD, arterial me­dia calcification, increased plasma levels of Ald and elevated serum biochemical parameters, including creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), phosphate and potassium. Serum calcium levels were not altered in rats with CKD. Compared with control aortas, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium content in calcified aortas were increased. The expression of osteogenic marker osteopontin (OPN) was up-regulated, and the expression of smooth muscle lineage marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was down-regulated in aortas of rats with CKD. Furthermore, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was activated in calcified aortas and its activation led to the phosphoryla­tion of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and the increase of β-catenin. Aldosterone antagonism with spirono­lactone (SPL) therapy mitigated aortic calcification, reduced serum Cr and BUN levels, and inhibited the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway as well. These results indicate that hyperaldosteronism could promote the progression of VC via Wnt/β-catenin pathway in rats with CKD. Ald blockade therapy may be effective in preventing the development of VC in patients with CKD.

N2  - Sortilin is encoded by the well-known cardiovascular risk gene SORT1, however Sortilin seems to modulate cardiovascular disease not only with lipids, and its function has not been well elucidated. Recent basic reports showed new aspects of Sortilin that it can bind to PCSK9, and also can enhance vascular calcification with non-lipid tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. We investigated the clinical roles of Sortilin in statin-treated primary dyslipidemia. Methods: A total of 62 patients (Male 33, Age 65±11 yrs) with primary dyslipidemia including 18 genetically confirmed heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were included. Non-FH group was treated with 10mg Atorvastatin, and FH group was treated with 20mg Rosuvastatin for 8 weeks. ELISA determined plasma levels of Sortilin and PCSK9 (free-fragment and hetero-dimer). Results: Strong statins lowered LDL-C (-44% in non-FH, -54% in FH), and increased hetero-dimer PCSK9 (+21% in non-FH, +102% in FH) but not in free-fragment PCSK9. Statins decreased Sortilin in non-FH (-19%, p<0.0001), but no significance in FH (-5%, ns). Change rates of Sortilin showed positive correlation with that of hetero-dimer PCSK9 in non-FH (R 9%, p<0.01) not that with LDL-C in non-FH. These date suggested interaction of PCSK9 and Sortilin. Intriguingly, Sortilin levels are positively correlated with Cr (p<0.05) and negatively with eGFR (p<0.05), but negatively with age (p<0.05), suggesting independent effect of renal function from age. Also Sortilin showed positive correlation with apo-CIII (p<0.001), RLP-C (p<0.01), and HOMA-R (p<0.01), implying association with atherogenic metabolic profiles. Conclusion: Statin treatment decreased Sortilin with correlation with hetero-dimer PCSK9 in non-FH. Sortilin showed association with reduced renal function, and may associate with vascular calcification mechanism among chronic kidney disease.

N2  - a. Objectives The consequences of Mineral and Bone Disorders associated to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD-MBD) are a daily challenge for pediatric nephrologists. b. Methods This single-center study is a prospective transversal evaluation of French pediatric CKD patients, part of the European 4C study. In addition to clinical and biochemical data, vascular and bone evaluation was performed: 24-hour blood pressure assessment, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at the ultra-distal tibia. Results are presented as median(range). Bivariate Spearman correlations and backward multivariable analyses (maximum 4 variables per model) were performed with SPSS 17.0. c. Results At a median age of 12.9(10.2-17.9)years, SDS-height of -1.0(-3.3;1.2) and eGFR of 33(11-72) mL/min/1.73m2, 32 patients (8 girls) were evaluated. Median calcium, phosphate, PTH and 25-D levels were 2.44(2.24- 2.78)mmol/L, 1.43(1.0-2.7)mmol/L, 80(9-359)pg/mL and 70(32-116)nmol/ L, respectively. Multivariable analyses showed that calcium and phosphate levels, as well as calcium-phosphate product and bone trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), were significantly positively associated with diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure (both for the 24-hour, day and night assessment), whereas PTH and vitamin D did not predict blood pressure. No correlations between Tb.Th or biomarkers with neither cIMT nor PWV remained significant. d. Conclusions These results are conflicting with previously reported associations between bone and vessels in CKD adults: the better the bone, the less the vascular calcifications. In contrast, in this study, we show that the greater the serum levels of calcium/phosphorus/calcium-phosphorus product, the greater the (diastolic and mean) blood pressure; moreover, the greater the Tb.Th, the greater the (diastolic and mean) blood pressure. Whether we use too much calcium supplements in our center deserves further studies.

N2  - Aim: To assess clinical impact of serum phosphorous loading for chronic kidney disease mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD), especially medial vascular calcification (MVC). Background: MVC is a critical complication of CKD, contributing to elevated hazard ratio of cardiovascular disease. Although animal model is essential for developing new treatments, CKD model mouse presenting MVC without any surgery, or drugs is not yet established. Methods: We have divided 8week old C57/BL6J male mice into CKD-HP, and CKD-NP groups. CKD-HP mice were fed 0.2% adenine/normal phosphorous diet for 6weeks followed by 0.2% adenine/high phosphorous chow for determinate weeks (A6P2; 2weeks, A6P4; 4weeks, A6P6; 6weeks). A6, A12 mice took 0.2% adenine/normal phosphorous diet for 6, 12weeks, respectively (CKD-NP group). Control mice were fed standard chow. Results: Compared with CKD-NP and Control group, serum levels of phosphorus, intact PTH, FGF-23 were significantly increased in CKD-HP group. Although CKD-NP and CKD-HP mice have both developed severe uremic conditions, only CKD-HP mice showed MVC by Computed tomography (CT) and histologic examination as short as two weeks after loading of high phosphorous diet. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of calcified aorta from all CKD-HP group revealed upregulation of Runx2, Alkaline phosphatase, Osteopontin and downregulation of SM22, alpha-Klotho compared with Control. Pit-1 and Pit-2 gene expression were only upregulated in A6P2 group. Furthermore, CT images of femur bone showed significant depletion of bone mineral density in CKD-HP group. Conclusions: Those results suggest that an elevation of serum phosphorus is essential to trigger MCV in addition to the uremic condition. MCV is developed by trans-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle, which may be caused by dysregulation of phosphate transporters due to alpha-Klotho degradation.

N2  - Background: Bone abnormalities are found almost universally in patients with CKD stage 5D and in the majority of patients with CKD stage 3-5. However, CKDMBD in the Indian population has been poorly studied. Aims of study: To study the prevalence of mineral bone disease in patients of chronic kidney disease. To study the clinical, biochemical and radiological profile of mineral bone disease in patients of CKD. Materials and Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study, two hundred patients with stage 3, 4, 5 and 5D of chronic kidney disease were studied. The diagnosis of mineral bone disease was based on the clinical history, examination, biochemical investigations and vascular calcification seen on radiological investigations. Results: The mean age of patients of chronic kidney disease was 52.4± 16.7 years. There was a male preponderance with a male to female ratio of 2.3:1. Approximately 1/2 of the patients had diabetic chronic kidney disease. The most common symptoms in our patients were proximal muscle weakness (91%), bone pains (59%) and pruritus (25%). Hypocalcaemia and hypercalcaemia were observed in 22% and 8% patients, respectively, and 3/4th of our patients had hyperphosphatemia. In our study, all patients in stage 3, 4 and 5 CKD had high turnover bone disease. However, 91% had low turnover bone disease in patients of CKD stage 5D; 2/3rd of our patients especially of CKD stage 5D showed vascular calcification. Conclusion: Thus results of our study showed high prevalence of a high turnover bone disease in non-dialysis patients of CKD (stage 3, 4 and 5) and a low turnover bone disease in stage 5D CKD.

N2  - Objective: Early vascular aging (EVA) is a feature of chronic kidney disease(CKD) and pulse wave velocity(PWV) is independent predictor of premature cardiovascular(CV) mortality.High blood pressure(BP) and vascular calcifications contribute mostly to EVA in this group.Endemic nephropathy(EN), an environmental form of aristolochic acid nephropathy, is a chronic tubulointerstitial salt wasting nephropathy characterized with later onset and milder forms of hypertension (HT), and in line with this we hypothesized that arterial stiffness progresses slowlier in EN pts resulting in lower CV mortality. Design and method: A total of 186 hemodialysed(HD) patients (90m, 96w; 67.35+13.07 years) were enrolled. At the end of follow up, after 25 months, 97 pts were alive (52EN and 45non-EN).All patients were dialysed by the international guidelines. Brachial BP was measured with Omron M6 device and PWV was determined by Arteriograph before mid-week dialysis. Results: There were no differences in gender, smoking status, type of vascular access, phosphate binder doses, vitamin D and dialysis modalities between two groups.At baseline and at the start of HD EN pts were significantly older (72. ± 37.1 vs 62.8 ± 15.1; p < 0.001), had shorter duration of HT prior commencement of HD than non-EN pts (36 vs. 84 months; p < 0.001). There were no differences in BP, but EN pts were treated with less antihypertensive drugs (p < 0.01).EN pts had lower values of P and CaxP (all p < 0.001) and significantly lower PWV values at baseline and at the end of follow-up period (9.2 ± 1.6 vs. 10.5 ± 1.9; 9.3 ± 1.3 vs. 10.5 ± 1.9, respectively; both p < 0.001). In multivariate analyses EN was independent predictor of high PWV. During the study period EN patients died significantly less frequently from CV events (12% vs. 32%; p = 0.001), and had longer mean survival time (22.3 vs. 18.2 months, p < 0.001). CV mortality was significantly lower in EN group (15.0% vs. 37.8%, HR 0.32 [0.18, 0.59], log-rank p = 0.0004), which remained significant after adjustment for other risk factors (aHR0.17[0.06, 0.49]). Baseline PWV > 10m/s was associated with higher risk for CV mortality(aHR 1.88[1.42, 2.49]). Conclusions: Despite being older EN patients had lower PWV values.In EN, later onset of HT during predialytic clinical course, milder form of HT and better control of phosphate during HD therapy slowdown vascular aging and thus CKD progression, and importantly resulting in lower CV mortality and longer survival time. Opposite to EVA in other CKD, EN might be the case of slower vascular aging.

N2  - Objective: Vascular calcification is recognized as a common complication in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. Many factors, particularly hyperphosphatemia, have been shown associated with the high prevalence of vascular calcification. Recently, the beneficial effects of magnesium on vascular calcification have been concerned. The present study aimed to investigate the role of magnesium on calcification induced by β-glycerophosphate (β-GP) in rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Methods: In vivo, Male SD rats were made uremic with vascular calcification by feeding adenine suspension and high phosphorous diet in presence of magnesium (0.02%, 0.05%, 0.15%) for 15 weeks. In vitro, Primary rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were exposed to 10 mM β-GP in medium with or without magnesium (1.0, 2.0, 3.0 mM) or 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborate (2-APB; an inhibitor of magnesium transport) for 14 days. Calcium deposition was determined by von Kossa staining, Alizarin red staining and quantification of calcium. The aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) was observed, and core-binding factor α-1 (Cbfα1) in aortic was measured by immunhistochemistry. In vitro, the expression levels of Cbfα1, matrix Gla protein (MGP) and osteopontin (OPN) were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or western blot analysis, following incubation for 0, 3, 6, 10 and 14 days with the different media, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: In vivo, high phosphorous administration to uremic rats with control magnesium resulted in significant calcium deposition in the aorta, increased aortic PWV and Cbfα1 expression. High phosphorous-treated uremic rats with high magnesium inhibited these phenomena, but low magnesium aggravated these effects. In vitro, higher magnesium may reduce VSMC calcification and ALP activity significantly compared with the calcification medium, and the inhibitory effect was in dose-dependent manner. The magnesium-induced changes in the VSMCs included a downregulation of Cbfα1 expression which was induced by β-GP after 3 days incubation, an effect that was gradually enhanced over the 14 days period. By contrast, magnesium produced notable increases in MGP and OPN expression levels, with an opposite pattern to that observed in the Cbfα1 expression levels. However, the addition of 2-APB appeared to inhibit the protective effect of magnesium on the VSMCs. Conclusions: Magnesium was able to effectively reduce β-GP-induced calcification in rat VSMCs in dose-dependent manner. The mechanism may be attributed to the regulation of the expression levels of calcification-associated factors in a time-dependent manner.

N2  - OBJECTIVES. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one ofthe leading public health problems. Cardiovasculardiseases (CVD) account for 50% of all deaths in the CKDsetting. Vascular calcification contributes significantlyto higher mortality among this population. Disordersof Ca-P metabolism were regarded for many years as amajor factor contributing to high cardiovascular riskin CKD patients. Proteinuria, especially together witheGFR, is a sensitive marker for progression of CKD butit has some limitations. Discovery of novel biomarkerschanges the understanding of the pathogenesis of bothprogressions of CKD and CVD risk.The aim of our study was to evaluate the levels ofHuman Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) and MatrixGla Protein (MGP) in hemodialysis (HD) patients andassess its possible links with cardiovascular diseasesand mortality.METHODS. The study included 81 HD patients (44 men(54.3%) and 37 women (45.7%)) treated at the HD unitof Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health SciencesKauno klinikos. Clinical data, FGF23, inactive form MGPand other laboratory data were analysed.RESULTS. The mean age of patients was 60.9 ± 16.01years (22-86) and the mean HD vintage was 39.26 ± 46.24months (1-182). The duration of HD of 52 patients (64.2%)was more than a year, 17 patients (21%) were diabetic,42 patients (51.9%) had cardiovascular diseases. Duringthe follow-up period, 17 (20.9%) patients died.Levels of MGP were significantly higher for patientswho survived after 2 years of follow-up compared topatients who died (2.05 ± 1.42 vs. 1.38 ± 0.53 ng/ml, p= 0.003). Positive correlation was found between FGF23and MGP (r = 0.76, p < 0.001).CONCLUSION. According to our findings, hemodialysis patients with 2-year survival had higher MGPvalues. These values and the unexpected findings of thepositive correlation between FGF23 and MGP allowed tosuggest that these novel biomarkers may play a role in thepathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases in hemodialysispatients. However, these findings require further research.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The treatment of hyperparathyroidism with calcitriol in CKD may develop cardiovascular disease induced by endothelial dysfunction and vascular calcification. This study examines the effects of the dosage and frequency of administration of calcitriol in an animal model of CKD. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a CKD diet (1% phosphate, 0.25% adenine) for 7 weeks. At week 3, animals began calcitriol treatment: CKD (0 calcitriol, n=8), 20CAL, 80CAL, (20 or 80 ng/kg/ calcitriol, once/day), 5CAL-QID, 20CAL-QID (5 or 20 ng/kg 4/day calcitriol, n=8) or CON (healthy control, N=6). CKD severity (serum creatinine), calcification (tissue levels of calcium and phosphate), and plasma levels of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), C-term fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and von Willebrand factor (VWF, a marker of endothelial dysfunction) were measured. Statistics are reported as mean ± st. dev. for normal data or median (range), one way ANOVA with Tukey post-test, and Pearson correlations. Results: Serum creatinine was similarly elevated between CKD groups (375.5 ± 136.1 uM). Serum phosphate and calcium were significantly elevated in CAL groups (6.2 ± 1.8 mM PO4, 3.6 ± 1.2 mM Ca) compared to CKD (3.8 ± 0.8 mM PO4, 1.9 ± 0.6 mM Ca, P<0.05) and CON (2.4 ± 0.3 mM PO4, 2.1 ± 0.1 mM Ca, P<0.001). FGF-23 was 8-20 fold higher in CAL groups vs CKD (11.7 (5.1-28.7) ng/ml , P<0.001). PTH, however, was significantly lower in the 5CAL-QID (1.8 ± 1.4 ng/ml, P<0.05), 80CAL (1.1 ± 1.1, P<0.001), and 20CAL-QID (1.6 ± 1.2, P<0.001) compared to CKD (3.9 ± 1.1). Thoracic and abdominal aortas had calcium-phosphate accrual (>100 nmol/mg tissue) in 0 CON, 25% CKD, and ≥75% of CAL animals in all groups. VWF was 2.5 fold higher in CKD (2.6 ± 1.0 rU/ml, P<.001) compared to CON (1 ± 0.2), and significantly higher in the CAL groups: 20CAL (4.2 ± 1.0), 5CAL-QID (4.0 ± 1.0), 80CAL (4 ± 0.8), 20CAL-QID(4.5 ± 1.3) compared to CON (P<0.001) and CKD (P<0.05). VWF levels significantly correlated with FGF-23 (logged data, r= 0.76), serum phosphate (r=0.64), creatinine (r=0.57), and thoracic and abdominal aorta calcification (r=0.62 and 0.64, P<0.0001 for all). Moreover, VWF levels >3.2 U/ml were only observed in animals with abdominal aorta calcium-phosphate accrual (>100 nmol/mg tissue). Conclusions: Calcitriol administered in a single daily dose or QID produced increased serum calcium, serum phosphate, vascular calcification and endothelial dysfunction. Moreover, the high levels of VWF in rats with aortic calcification could be an endothelial response to increased shear stress, and could lead to a pro-thrombotic state in CKD. Although the higher doses of calcitriol did lower PTH levels significantly compared to CKD group, off-target cardiovascular effects suggest reconsidering calcitriol treatment in individuals with existing vascular calcification.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) of tissues. In chronic kidney disease (CKD) they are up-regulated and linked as critical to the process of vascular calcification (VC), a high risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The study's aim was to examine the role of ECM constituents, specifically the MMPs, on vascular mineral accrual in a progressive model of CKD using doxycycline, a common antibiotic known to inhibit MMP activity. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered standard rat chow or a CKD-inducing diet (0.25% adenine) for 3 weeks. At 3 weeks, animals were stratified based on serum creatinine levels (uM) into 2 groups: CKD (0.25% adenine, n=8, creatinine: 472.3 ±81.58) and CKD-DX (0.30mg/kg doxycycline twice daily with 0.25% adenine, n=9, creatinine: 382.2±63.99). An additional age-matched healthy Control group (n=6, creatinine: 41.62±4.267) was included. Animals were treated for 4 weeks and then sacrificed. Results: Both CKD and CKD-DX showed significant elevations in serum PO43- compared to control (p<0.0001), as well as CKD-DX being significantly higher than CKD (p < 0.05). CKD-DX rats showed significant reductions in the proportion of vessels that calcified (defined as Ca2+ > 30nmol/mg tissue and PO43- > 18nmol/mg tissue; p < 0.05). Further, CKD-DX rats showed significant differences in their pattern of accrual for both Ca2+ and PO43- (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effects of MMP inhibition on vascular mineral accrual and subsequently VC. MMP inhibition with doxycycline creates significant differences in the build-up of both Ca2+ and PO43- in vessels of treated versus untreated CKD rats. These different accrual patterns translate to reductions in proportion of vessels that calcify. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Patients suffering from chronic kidney disease show a functional vitamin K deficiency and exhibit predominant vascular calcifications. Vitamin K dependent carboxylation by the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) is essential for activation of matrix gla protein, inhibiting vascular calcification processes. The GGCX activity was shown to be decreased in uremic rats. This effect was reversible by high dose intake of vitamin K. Methods: Two models of experimental uremia were investigated in the current study: A) Adenine-induced nephropathy: CKD was induced in 5 male WISTAR rats by adenine intake (0.75%) in the absence and presence of vitamin K over a period of 7 weeks. B) 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx): 3 C57BL/6 wildtype mice underwent surgical one step procedure accompanied by high phosphate diet over 9 weeks. GGCX was isolated from aortic, liver and kidney samples and was fractionated to homogeneity by polyacrylamid electrophoresis. The GGCX containing blot was digested by trypsin and analysed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ ionisation time of flight mass-spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF-mass-spectrometry) using MS and MS/MS techniques. The resulting fragments were identified by using Mascot Database, too. Results: Serum urea was significantly increased in both models from 6.23 to 36.37 mmol/l in adenine rats and from 10.28 to 18.10mmol/l in 5/6 Nx mice. While GGCX was found to be carbamylated in both uremic animal models, guanylation was only present in the model of the adenine-induced nephropathy. We were not able to detect post-translational modifications (PTMs) of GGCX isolated from control animals. Guanylations were detected in the adenine-induced nephropathy model; mainly identified at Lys 351 (5 of 5 rats) and Lys 520 (3 of 5 rats), as well as carbamylation was detected at Arg 463 (5 of 5 rats), Arg 9, 673 and 687 (2 of 5 rats). In addition, we detected carbamylation in the 5/6 nephrectomy model at position Arg 436, 672 (3 of 3 mice) and 480 (2 of 3 mice). A homology matching with the human GGCX proposes Lys 351 as potential guanlyation site and Arg 347, 436. 673 and 687 for carbamylation. No PTMs were detected in after vitamin K supplementation in adenine-induced nephropathy model (pooled aorta). Conclusions: In conclusion, post-translational modifications of the GGCX by the uremic milieu are eliminated by vitamin K. We hypothesize PTMs of the GGCX are the cause for its reduced activity.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC), in which vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) undergo transformation into osteoblast-like cells is closely related to cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Over the recent years, several factors were demonstrated to be involved in process of VC. However, the cellular mechanisms responsible have yet to be fully explained. Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) has been proposed to play an inhibitory role in vascular calcification, but was not found to be associated with outcomes in recent human experiments. Additionaly, its inhibitory effect has not been fully elucidated. Methods: Seventy-nine patients undergoing renal transplantation from which epigastric artery samples were taken at the time of surgery, were included in this study. BMP-7 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity in endothelial (BMP-7e) and media smooth muscle cells (BMP-7m) was assessed by grading (0 - 3) and the results were expressed as percentage of positive cells (negative < 10 %, 10-49 %- grade 1, 50-74%- grade 2, and more than 75 %- grade - 3). Microvascular calcification was assessed by the von Kossa staining method. Pelvic X-rays were used to determine presence of macrovascular calcifications which were classified as present or absent. Results: Average age of recipient was 51 ± 14 years, 60% were male. The median dialysis vintage was 2.8 years (range, 1-4). Glomerulonephritis (40%) was the most common cause of CKD. Four patients had type II diabetes and 8% had history of cardiovascular diseases. Vascular calcifications determined by X-rays at the time of transplantation were recorded in 59% of patients and were significantly associated with age, smoking, hyperlipoproteinemia, and dialysis vintage, but not with sevelamer or calcium carbonate therapy. Patients with BMP7e grade 3 staining had 18 times higher odds for X-rays visible vascular calcifications compared to patients without BMP-7e expression after adjustment for other variables. BMP-7m expression had no statistically significant correlations with other variables. Von Kossa staining was not associated with either BMP7 staining in endothelium or media of epigastric artery, or with other parameters. Conclusions: We observed a marked BMP-7 overexpression in endothelial, but not media SMC cells of epigastric arteries of patients with radiologicaly visible vascular calcifications. We postulate that increased BMP-7e expression might be result of attempt to protect blood vessels and to reduce VC. However, this speculation has to be tested in future investigations.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Hypertension (HTN) is an established cardiovascular risk factor and is closely related with mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Recent studies demonstrated central blood pressure (CBP) was a significant predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and had stronger relationship with vascular damage such as vascular calcification and stiffness than peripheral blood pressure (PBP). Therefore, we investigated the association of CBP or PBP with markers for target organ damage measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and coronary calcium score (CCS) in CKD patients including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Methods: Patients enrolled by Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease Etiology Research center (CMERC) of Yonsei University College of Medicine between November 2013 and May 2015 were eligible in this study. We analyzed the associations between central or peripheral blood pressure values (systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure) and parameters for target organ damage measured by PWV and CCS in CKD patients. Results: Among a total of 424 CKD patients, 248 (58.4%) were male and mean age was 59±12.4 years. Mean central systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) were 132.7 and 54.8 mmHg and mean peripheral SBP and PP were 135.7 and 58.2 mmHg in study patients. The central SBP and PP were significantly higher in patients with advanced CKD stage compared to those in less advanced CKD patients. There were significant correlations between central or peripheral SBP and markers for target organ damage (PWV; r = 0.424 vs 0.361 and CCS; 0.262 vs 0.196, all p < 0.001). The associations of central SBP with presented markers for target organ damage were significantly stronger than peripheral SBP in total CKD patients (PWV; Z = 2.050, P = 0.040 and CCS; Z = 2.010, P = 0.044). When we evaluated the associations between blood pressure values and markers according to CKD stage, central SBP was more closely correlated with markers for target organ damage compared to peripheral SBP in early CKD population. However, present study did not show better association of CBP with markers for target organ damage compared to PBP in ESRD patients. Conclusions: Central SBP and PP are significantly associated with markers for target organ damage in CKD patients. In addition, central SBP has stronger associations with CCS and PWV compared to peripheral SBP in non-dialysis CKD patients. However, CBP is not superior to PBP for predicting target organ damage in ESRD patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is the mineralization of the vasculature via deposition of calcium-phosphate crystals. VC is a common manifestation of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which increases arterial stiffness and negatively affects cardiovascular hemodynamics. VC of the aorta, necessarily including the thoracic segment, results in elevated pulse wave velocity (PWV), an indicator of decreased arterial compliance and a predictor of mortality. Recent research indicates that peripheral vasculature, such as the pudendal artery, has a distinct susceptibility to VC. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether mineral accumulation in the pudendal artery in an adenine-induced rat model of CKD is a sentinel for calcification of the thoracic aorta and resulting alterations in PWV. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed standard rat chow (n=61) or placed on an established 7-week high protein 0.25% adenine diet (n=145) to induce CKD and produce a vascular calcification phenotype. At 7 weeks, the carotid to iliac bifurcation PWV was measured under general aesthetic (isoflurane 2%) and normalized to mean arterial pressure. Calcium and phosphate content was analyzed via colorimetric assays in various central and peripheral arteries and contractility of the pudendal artery was assessed via potassium-induced maximum contraction. Results: The diet protocol generated a range of CKD severity (serum creatinine 16 to 546 μM, mean 204 ± 127 μM). Serum creatinine was not correlated with elevated PWV (r2=0.02). Accumulating tissue phosphate and calcium in the thoracic aorta (>30 nmol of calcium/mg tissue; >18 nmol of phosphate/mg tissue) were necessary for an increase in PWV ( p<0.0001). The pudendal artery was calcified in all cases of thoracic aorta VC and elevated PWV (Figure). The PWV of rats with thoracic aorta VC (n = 79) was significantly higher than both those with no VC (n = 97) and those with only calcified pudendals (n = 28) (p<0.0001). Rats with only calcified pudendals had PWV that were not significantly different than rats with no VC. No rats in this analysis had calcified thoracic aortas without pudendal artery VC (Figure). Accumulating pudendal minerals negatively correlated with vessel contractility (r2=0.15, p<0.006). Conclusions: These findings show that the progressive accumulation of phosphate and calcium in the vascular microenvironment is particularly severe in the pudendal artery, and occurs prior to calcification of the thoracic aorta and systemic changes. Pudendal artery calcification appears to be an early sentinel for alterations in central haemodynamic parameters, including PWV, and further vascular calcification. (Figure presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is a recognized marker of the cardiovascular risk and an independent factor associated with a poor prognosis in dialysis patients. International guidelines (KDIGO 3.3.2) recommend use of lateral abdominal radiograph and radiographic scores (Kauppila and Adragao) to screen and evaluate for VC in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and to use this information to guide the management of CKD mineral and bone disorders (MBD). This survey describes to what extent French nephrologists are implementing these recommendations. Methods: The survey was carried out between May 11th and June 22nd 2015. Forty-eight nephrologists taking care of dialysis patients responded from a pool of 600 French nephrologists, which is consistent with the expected response rate of 8-10% for market research surveys. Each participant was asked to fill an on-line survey for 6 “incident” dialysis patients, CKD patients starting the dialysis therapy between 01/ DEC/2014 and 28/FEB/2015. Results: 48% of Nephrologists followed more than 100 patients and 42% between 50-100 patients. They were 88% working in public hospitals or clinics (exclusive 71%, mixed health centre and private activity 17%). Data from 281 patients were analyzed. At the start of the dialysis therapy, standard radiographies, allowing establishing Kauppila (abdomen) and/or Adragao (hands and pelvis) scores were performed in 66 patients (23%). VC was present in 73% of these patients with mean Kauppila and Adragao scores of 8.7 (of a maximum possible score of 24) and 4 (of a maximum possible score of 8), respectively. Patients with VC (n = 48) were older than patients without VC (n = 18): mean age 67 vs 56 yr. They were more often males (73 vs 50%), sedentary (56 vs 22%) and with a history of cardiovascular disease (42 vs 22%). Serum calcium and phosphate were comparable between groups; however, PTH values were higher in patients with VC (455 vs 349 pg/mL). Mean serum 25OHD levels were low in both groups: 22.6 ng/mL in patients with VC vs 20.5 ng/mL in patients without VC. Patients with VC were more often treated with statins (73 vs 39%), aspirin (63 vs 33%), and cinacalcet (21 vs 6%) than those without VC. Among the 48 patients with VC, 33 were taking phosphate binders, and 12 out of these 33 patients (36 %) received a calcium-based phosphate binder. Conclusions: This survey highlights a gap between the recommendations and the clinical practice concerning the screening for VC in incident dialysis patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Although patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not only suffered from bone fractures more frequently but also experience higher mortality from fractures, little is known about the renal specific factors associated decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in these patients. Methods: We analyzed the data of 1173 patients (more than 50 years, male/female 741/ 432) at enrollment to KNOW-CKD (KoreaN cohort study for Outcome in patients With Chronic Kidney Disease) which is currently on-going, prospective, university hospital based observational CKD cohort study under the sponsorship of Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (NCT01630486). Patients were divided into two group of normal (T-score more than -1.0) and decreased (T-score less than -1.0) BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) using Word Health Organization criteria. Results: Participants'mean age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urine protein to creatinine ratio were 60.9 years, 43.4 ml/min/1.73 m2, and 1.4 g/g, respectively. Among of them, 592 patients had osteopenia or osteoporosis. Old age (Odd ratio [OR] 1.063, P <0.001), female sex (3.643, P <0.001), low body mass index (BMI) (OR 0.845, P<0.001), low eGFR (OR 0.990, P = 0.001), high sodium (OR 1.078, P = 0.019), high mean brachial to ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) (log baPWV OR 2.623, P = 0.022) were associated with increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis in total patients. In contrast to patients with stage 1-2 CKD (n = 251) in which only traditional risk factors such as old age (OR 1.072, P = 0.013) and low BMI (0.767, P <0.001) without any renal specific factors were associated with decreased BMD, renal specific factors such as eGFR (OR 0.977, P <0.001), serum sodium (OR 1.075, P = 0.041) and baPWV (log baPWV OR 3.281, P = 0.013) reflecting vascular calcification were associated with decreased BMD along with traditional risk factors such as female sex (OR 5.179, P <0.001), current/former smoking (OR 1.691, P = 0.032) in patients with stage 3-5 CKD (n = 922). Conclusions: Renal specific factors such as eGFR, serum sodium level, and baPWV representing vascular calcification were associated with decreased bone mineral density in patients with eGFR less than 60ml/min/1.73m2.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The last decade have shown that FGF23 and Klotho may have relevant independent actions on the renal and cardiovascular systems. They interfere with vascular functions and may play a role in vascular calcification, atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis. On the other hand, pulse pressure is a well-known risk factor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in renal patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between FGF-23 and Klotho with pulse pressure in type 2 diabetic with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 2-3. Methods: In a observational study we included 107 type 2 diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 2- 3, followed in our outpatient Diabetic Kidney Clinic. We used descriptive statistics, the Student's t and the chi-square tests. We also divided our population according to the pulse pressure, G I <50 mmHg (n=79) and G2 ≥ 50 mmHg (n=61), and we compared these groups regarding the several biological and laboratorial parameters analyzed. We employed a multiple regression model to identify risk factors of increased pulse pressure (PP). In this model we used as dependent variable the pulse pressure, and as independent ones age, mineral metabolism parameters, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, eGFR, FGF-23 and Klotho levels. Results: The mean age of these patients was 59.6 years, the mean eGFR (MDRD) was 43.5ml/min and 37.4% (40) were female. We found that G2 patients showed higher age (p=0.017), phosphorus (p=0.0001), iPTH (p=0.0001), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (p=0.001), Homa-IR ( p=0.001), FGF-23 (p=0.0001) and OxLDL (p=0.0001) and lower levels of eGFR (p=0.0001), Klotho (p=0.0001) and 25(OH)2D3 ( p=0.0001). In the multivariate linear regression model we found that FGF-23 (β=0.377, p=0.047) and the Klotho (β= - 0.567, p=0.023) are independent risk factors for increasing the pulse pressure. Conclusions: In a population of type 2 diabetic with chronic kidney disease stages 2-3, the Klotho and FGF-23 levels are independently associated with PP. Further studies with more patients and with medical intervention are warranted to confirm whether an increase in Klotho and a decrease in FGF-23 would reduce the PP and consequently the cardiovascular risk of our patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Recent reports demonstrated that Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) acts as an inhibitor of vascular calcification and might be a potential biomarker for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, however, the role of DMP1 has never been explored in dialysis patients. We investigated the prognostic value of DMP1 on cardiovascular outcomes in prevalent peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Methods: We recruited 223 prevalent PD patients and divided into high and low DMP1 group according to plasma DMP1 levels. The all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular events were compared between the two groups. Cox proportional hazards analysis determined the independent association of DMP1 with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. Results: The mean age was 52.1±11.8 years and 116 (52.0%) patients were male. The median value of DMP1 was 1.49 (0.38-15.60). During a mean follow-up duration of 34.6 months, incident cardiovascular events were observed in 41 (18.4%) patients. Multiple Cox analysis showed that low DMP1 was significantly associated with incident cardiovascular events (log 1 increase: hazard ratio=0.855, confidence interval=0.743-0.984, P=0.029) after adjustment for multiple confounding factors. Conclusions: Low DMP1 was significantly associated with incident cardiovascular events in PD patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Presence and severity of cardiovascular calcification are associated with poor outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of abdominal aortic calcification and the predictive factors of vascular calcification in Thai dialysis and non-dialysis CKD patients. Methods: In this cross-sectionally study, patients were consecutively enrolled across 25 sites in Thailand until 1500 enrollments. Adult CKD patients (≥18 and ≤70 years) confirmed with a minimum 3 months prior to the evaluation as stage 3-5 (dialysis or non-dialysis) with signed informed consent form were eligible for inclusion. The exclusion criteria were 1) post-renal transplant patients; 2) pregnant women; 3) candidate not suitable for X-ray;4) patients with acute kidney injury, very severe comorbidities with poor survival outcome; 5) concomitant diseases that affect calcium status and soft tissue calcifications; 6) patients who received parathyroidectomy. The primary evaluation was abdominal aortic calcification which was assessed by a validated 0-24 abdominal aorta calcification (AAC) score on lateral abdominal radiographs. Predictive factors for the AAC score ≥ 5 were analyzed with multi-variable logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 1,500 patients (55.4% male, mean age 54.7 (SD 11.4) years) from 24 study sites were included, of whom 814 (54.3%) and 686 (45.7%) were pre- and ongoing dialysis, respectively. The prevalence of AAC as judged from AAC score ≥ 1 was 70.6 % (95% CI: 67.4% - 73.7%) and 70.8% (95% CI: 67.3% - 74.1%) for pre- and ongoing dialysis patients, respectively. Thirty-one percent overall had AAC ≥ 5. Predictive factors for the AAC score ≥ 5 for pre-dialysis pateints are advanced patient's age and widening pulse blood pressure (odds ratio (OR): 1.115 and 1.017, with p < 0.01 and 0.013 respectively). For patients on dialysis, the predictive factors were advanced patient's age, history of coronary artery disease or diabetes, long dialysis vintage (OR: 1.083, 2.956, 1.852 and 1.008, all with p < 0.05), and most strikingly, corrected serum calcium and hs-CRP (with OR: 1.468, and 1.223, both with p < 0.01, respectively). In order to explore clinically meaningful information, a series of regression analyses were performed with different corrected serum calcum cut-offs. The results showed a peaked odds ratio of 1.974 (95% CI: 1.324 - 2.943) for the corrected serum calcium cut-off at 9.5 mg/dL. In additional subgroup analysis of patients with diabetes (n = 692), 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D was found to be a protective factor for AAC (OR 0.983, p = 0.0104), while serum phosphorus was found to be another predictive factor for AAC (OR 1.178, p = 0.0153). Conclusions: Prevalence of AAC in Thai CKD patients has been reported. Most variables identified as predictive factors for AAC are consistent with the findings from previously studies. However, the corrected serum calcium was identified as another predictor of abdominal aorta calcification in this study.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification is a frequent complication of chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease. In general population and patients with end stage renal disease vascular calcification is associated with arterial stiffness and is a predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Various diagnostic methods are currently used to assess vascular calcification. There is a tendency for simple, reliable methods that can be used in daily practice. Up to date, a single method which would be able to guide calcification prevention or treatment and assessment of cardiovascular risk hasn't been found yet. Therefore, several imaging and laboratory methods are investigated. Methods: 102 chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients (60 men (58.8 %)), mean age 61,8 years (range 24 - 85 years) were enrolled in the study. The mean duration of HD treatment had been 52,3 months (range 1 - 208 months). All patients signed agreement to participate in the study. The study was approved by the Republic ethics committee - number 95/12/11. Coronary Artery Calcification Score (CACS) was performed in 28 patients. All 102 HD patients had Abdominal Aortic Calcification Score (AACS) from lateral lumbar radiograph and Simple Vascular Calcification Score (SVCS) from pelvic and hand radiograph. Vascular stiffness was assessed with carotid-femoral PulseWave Velocity (cfPWV) in 93 patients, ankle-brachial index (ABI) in 88 patients and carotid Intima Media Thickness (IMT) in 102 patients. Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF-23) was measured in 100 patients. Spearman's test was used for correlation between parameters. Results: High prevalence of vascular calcification was found. 26 (92%) of 28 patients had coronary artery calcification. 82.4% of 102 patients had radiographically visible calcification of lateral abdominal aorta , 76.5% on pelvis and 55.9% on hand radiograph. A positive Spearman's correlation was demonstrated between CACS and AACS (P<0.000, rho=0,665 ), CACS and SVCS pelvis (P<0.000, rho=0,654) and CACS and SVCS hand(P<0.007, rho=0,497). A positive Spearman's correlation was also found between CACS and cfPWV (P<0.002, rho=0,594), AACS and cfPWV (P<0.000, rho=0,442), SVCS pelvis and cfPWV (P<0.000, rho=0,466) and SVCS hand and cfPWV (P<0.000, rho=0,427). IMT correlated with AACS (P<0.000, rho=0,590), and SVCS pelvis (P<0.000, rho=0,401), and SVCS hand (P<0.005, rho=0,279) and also cfPWV (P<0.000, rho=0,533). Negative Spearman's correlation was demonstrated between AACS and ABI (P<0.002, rho=-0,321), SVCS pelvis and ABI (P<0.025, rho=-0,240), SVCS hand and ABI (P<0.012, rho=-0,267) and also cfPWV and ABI (P<0.006, rho=-0,300). We have not found any statistically significant correlation between FGF-23 and calcifications and cfPWV. Conclusions: In our study, we established that CACS, which represents gold standard for detecting and quantifying vascular calcification is related to AACS, SVCS in pelvic and hand arteries and cfPWV. In our study, we also established a negative correlation between AACS and SVCS and ABI. Simple imaging methods (AACS, SVCS) and cfPWV are gaining confidence in vascular damage assessment, and further therapy adjustment could be guided. Association of FGF-23 to other diagnostic modalities in our study was not found.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. Data on VC prevalence and management in Chinese patients on dialysis are limited, leading to sub-optimal awareness, prognosis and dialysis management. The China Dialysis Calcification Study (CDCS) is the first large, observational study conducted in China to investigate the predictive value of VC and its burden on patients with CKD on dialysis. Methods: The CDCS is a nationwide, multi-center, non-interventional, 24-month prospective study which included adult ESRD patients (≥18 and <75 years) receiving hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) for ≥6 months. Patients were assessed at Baseline and four 6-monthly follow-ups. Primary evaluation criteria were baseline prevalence of coronary artery calcification (CAC) measured by EBCT or multi-detector CT using the Agatston score, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) assessed by plain lateral lumbar radiograph using the Kauppila score, and cardiac valve calcification measured by echocardiography. The Baseline Calcification Data Completed (BCDC) population was defined as patients with all three VC images. Total VC was defined as confirmed presence of VC in ≥1 location (CAC, AAC or cardiac valve calcification). Here we report a planned interim analysis of baseline VC, conducted once enrolment was complete. The study was sponsored by Sanofi and registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-OCH-14004447). Results: 1522 patients were screened; 1501 had baseline assessment and were included in this analysis. Compared with PD patients, HD patients had a higher mean age (51.1 vs. 47.0 years), proportion of males (62.0% vs. 50.2%) and mean dialysis vintage (4.9 vs. 3.4 years; Table 1). The most common causes of CKD were chronic glomerulonephritis, diabetes, and hypertension (51.8%, 15.5% and 10.7%). Overall, 77.3% of patients had total VC, and 68.2%, 46.5% and 28.8% had CAC, AAC and cardiac valve calcification, respectively (Table 1). Compared with patients on PD, those on HD had a significantly higher prevalence of total VC (80.7% vs. 65.2%; P<0.0001) and CAC, AAC and cardiac valve calcification. In the BCDC population, the most common distribution of calcification was CAC + AAC (23.3%), isolated CAC (20.3%), and CAC + AAC + cardiac valve calcification (17.8%; Table 2). Conclusions: The prevalence of VC among Chinese patients with ESRD on dialysis is 77.3%, comparable to rates reported in Europe and North America (70-90%), and is significantly higher in patients on HD versus PD. The association between VC and CVD, and CKD management and the development of both VC and CVD, will be investigated in subsequent analyses. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is a recognized marker of the cardiovascular risk and an independent factor associated with a poor prognosis in dialysis patients, who exhibit an extremely high risk of global and cardiovascular mortality. International recommendations (KDIGO 3.3.2) recommend lateral abdominal radiograph and radiographic scores (Kauppila and Adragao) have been proposed to screen and evaluate for VC in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD), and to use this information to guide the management of CKD mineral and bone disorders (MBD). This survey describes to what extent French nephrologists are implementing these recommendations. Methods: The survey was carried out between May 11th and June 22nd 2015. Forty-eight nephrologists taking care of dialysis patients responded from a pool of 600 French nephrologists. Each participant was asked to fill an on-line survey for 6 “incident” dialysis patients, CKD patients starting the dialysis therapy between 01/ DEC/2014 and 28/FEB/2015. Results: Among the nephrologists, 48% followed more than 100 patients and 42% between 50-100 patients. They were 88% working in public hospitals or clinics (exclusive 71%, mixed health centre and private activity 17%). Data from 281 patients were obtained and analyzed. At the start of the dialysis therapy, standard radiographies, allowing establishing Kauppila (abdomen) and/or Adragao (hands and pelvis) scores were performed in 66 patients (23%). VC was present in 73% of these patients with mean Kauppila and Adragao scores of 8.7/24 and 4/8, respectively. Patients with VC (n = 48) were older than patients without VC (n = 18): mean age 67 versus 56 years. They were more often males (73 versus 50%), sedentary (56 versus 22%) and with a history of cardiovascular disease (42 versus 22%). Serum calcium and phosphate levels were comparable between groups; however, PTH values were higher in patients with VC (455 versus 349 pg/mL). Mean serum 25OHD levels were low in both groups: 22.6 ng/ mL in patients with VC versus 20.5 ng/mL in patients without VC. Patients with VC were more often treated with statins (73 versus 39%), aspirin (63 versus 33%), and cinacalcet (21 versus 6%) than those without VC. Among the 48 patients with VC, 33 were taking phosphate binders, and 12 out of these 33 patients (36 %) received a calcium-based phosphate binder. Conclusions: This survey highlights a gap between the recommendations and the clinical practice concerning the screening for CV in incident dialysis patients. It suggests that a significant number of patients with VC nevertheless receive a calcium-based phosphate binder.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease, despite being a "silent epidemic" disease, represents one of the main causes of mortality in general population, along with cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of poor prognosis for these patients. The specific objective of our study was to characterize the relationship between the inflammatory status, the bone disorders markers, and kidney failure in chronic kidney disease patient stages 2-4, in order to design a novel biomarker panel that improves early disease diagnosis and therapeutic response, thus being further integrated into clinical applications. A panel of proteomic biomarkers, assessed by xMAP array, which includes mediators of inflammation (IL-6, TNF-α) and mineral and bone disorder biomarkers (OPG, OPN, OCN, FGF-23, and Fetuin-A), was found to be more relevant than a single biomarker to detect early CKD stages. The association between inflammatory cytokines and bone disorders markers, IL-6, TNF-α, OPN, OPG, and FGF-23, reflects the severity of vascular changes in CKD and predicts disease progression. Proteomic xMAP analyses shed light on a new approach to clinical evaluation for CKD staging and prognosis.

N2  - Introduction: In cases of chronic kidney disease (CKD), bone and mineral metabolism changes occur which favor soft tissue calcification. Alterations in the RANK/RANKL/OPG system could also favor vascular calcification, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in CKD. Objective: In an in vivo experimental model of chronic renal failure progression, we assess the effect of CKD on vascular calcification and bone loss correlating these changes in the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway. An in vitro system was used to confirm findings. Material and Methods: Two models of vascular calcification were used: an in vivo rat model with chronic renal failure fed on a diet with different phosphorus content, and an in vitro model in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) subjected to different calcifying stimuli. Results: At 20 weeks, 50% of animals with a diet high in phosphorus presented aortic calcification accompanied by increased aortic expression of RANKL. In contrast, OPG decreased probably as a consequence of an inflammatory component. At 20 weeks, expression of RANKL and OPG in the tibia increased, while the increase in OPG occurred at earlier stages. In VSMC, the addition of uremic serum and calcification medium increased calcium content and expression of RANKL and OPG. The addition of OPG and silencing of RANK inhibited this increase. Conclusions: Our results confirm RANK/RANKL/OPG system involvement in the vascular calcification process.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunction is an underreported finding in chronic kidney disease patients. Common problems include menstrual disturbances in women; erectile dysfunction (ED) in men & decreased libido & infertility in both sexes. Organic factors along with psychological factors & depression are important causes. 40% of male & 55% of female dialysis patients do not achieve orgasm. ED can be due to a number of problems. Thus; this study was conducted to address the specific issue in the Indian context. AIM OF THE STUDY: To study the prevalence & the causes of sexual & gonadal dysfunction in male patients with chronic kidney disease. METHODS: A prospective; observational cohort study of 30 male patients attending the OPD or IPD of the Department of Nephrology & Department of Endocrinology; Apollo Gleneagles Hospital; Kolkata with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) was conducted over a period of 18 months. They were given the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire for evaluation of erectile dysfunction. They were evaluated further for the possible pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for the symptoms; after taking due consent. Chi square test was used to test the degree of significance of the various factors in the study population contributing to erectile dysfunction. Patients were selected for the study as per the following inclusion & exclusion criteria:INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) Adult Male CKD patients.(2) Patients from both Outpatient & Inpatient Department.EXCLUSION CRITERIA:(1) Unwilling patients. (2) Diabetic patients.Diabetics were excluded in this study to prevent confounding. RESULTS: The average age (+ S.D.) was 46.3 years (+ 7.7) of which 73% were from OPD. Maximum number of patients were in CKD stage 3 (43.3%) followed by CKD stage 5 (27%) & 4 (20%) of which 20% were on hemodialysis. Hypertension (90%) & Anemia (43.3%) were the most significant co-morbidities. Anxiety & depression were important causes of sexual dysfunction. The association of Domperidone use & its statistically significant correlation (p0.05) with high serum prolactin levels was an important eye opener. Hormonal profiling showed trend towards low testosterone & high prolactin levels; corroborating with other studies. 43.3 % of patients however refused hormonal testing due to high cost. There were no patients with autonomic dysfunction. Abdominal Xray did not reveal any vascular calcifications. The IIEF questionnaire revealed that the average score across all the domains of sexual function was very low. 1 patient was found to have chyluria causing him depression contributing to sexual dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: This study throws light on the causes of sexual dysfunction in the CKD non diabetic Indian male patients. Domperidone causing high prolactin levels was shown to be a cause. Hormonal profiling supports testosterone supplementation in CKD patients. Reluctance for evaluation remains a big concern.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular calcifications (CVC) are common in among patients undergoing dialysis and are associated increased morbidity and mortality. They are secondary to several factors, especially the disturbances of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. The aim of our work is to describe the epidemiology of CVC in chronic hemodialysis. Methods: It was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in the hemodialysis department of the Military Hospital of Tunis compiling all cases with CVC among 61 chronic hemodialysis patients during the period from May to August 2014. Results: A total of 61 dialysis individuals were included. Mean age was 55 years, ranging from 16 to 86 years. Thirty eight were males. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia were noted respectively in 95 %, 19 % and 23 % of cases. Fifty Two percent of our patients were smoking and 31 % were alcoholics. The initial nephropathy was glomerular, vascular, tubulointerstitial and indeterminate nephropathy in 33 %, 23 %, 13 % and 26 % of all cases. The median time on dialysis was 8.5 years. Biological parameters showed a mean serum calcium at 2, 15mmol/l [1.51-2.27, phosphorus at 1,54mmol/l [0.44-2.45], alkaline phosphatase at 131 IU/L [14-710] and PTH at 414pg/mL [36-2417]. CVC were noted in 28% of our patients. Vascular calcifications were present in 16 cases while valvular calcification in only one patient. Fourteen patients present valvular alterations especially at the mitral valves. Conclusions: The CVC is a significant risk factor for mortality in chronic renal failure. The correction of risk factors would be a way to prevent these cardiovascular abnormalities in order to reduce morbidity and mortality and to ensure a better quality of life for hemodialysis. Our study confirms the high prevalence of CVC in hemodialysis patients and emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of cardiovascular risk factors including calcium phosphate disorders in this population.

N2  - Objective: Established the animal model of early stage of CKD and detection whether the vascular calcification is happened. Then investigated the relationship between vascular calcification and oxidative stress. Methods: 6 male 10 weeks SD rats fed with chow containing 0.75% adenine, 0.25% protein, 1.06% calcium and 0.92% phosphorus. Collect the 24-hour urine and serum in weeks 0, 2, 3 and 4 to measure creatinine clearance rate. 32 male 11 weeks SD rat, collect the 24-hour urine and randomly divided into normal group, contrast feeding group, model group and treatment group. The latter two groups were fed with chow above-mentioned. Give the MnTMPyP 30 nmol per day intraperitoneally to treatment group. The other two groups were fed with standardized chow containing the same calcium and phosphorus. Make the intake of contrast feeding group same with model group. After 4 weeks, anesthetize the rats collect blood and 24-hour urine to measure serum biochemical parameters and 8-OHdG in ELISA. Collect aortas to measure Von Kossa staining and calcium content assay. Runx2, SM22α were measured in western blot. Results: The kidney of model group and treatment group appeared as “big white kidney”. The cortex tend to thin and the demarcation of medulla is unclear. The glomerulus atrophy and a lot of black crystal deposited on the renal interstitium and lymphocyte infiltrated in the interstitium. Also the creatinine increased and creatinine clearance decreased significantly (p < 0.01). And accord with the standard of early CKD in rats. And the hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are significantly too (p < 0.01). 8-OHdG, calcium content and calcification increased significantly and treatment group has a downward trend. The expression of SM22α significant descreased while Runx2 is increased. Conclusion: CKD-MBD have already occurred in early stage of CKD. Phosphorus and oxidative stress participated in the vascular calcification and the phenotype transdifferentiation of VSMCs is the principal reason in it.

N2  - Purpose: Children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis, have mortality rates that are 30 times higher than the general pediatric population. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in children and young adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney transplant. However, there are no guidelines for appropriate screening, assessment or standardized follow-up for cardiac pathology in pediatric CKD. Cardiac involvement may manifests as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), vascular calcification. Although, ventricular hypertrophy in children with CKD has been appreciated for some time, there is very limited data based on 20-30 patients, about diastolic dysfunction in pediatric patients. In adults with CKD, diastolic dysfunction has been shown to be an independent risk factor for mortality. Heart failure literature also supports the importance of early recognition, appropriate follow-up and treatment of diastolic dysfunction. The purpose of this study is to define the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction (DD) in pediatric CKD patients using a large single center experience. Identify risk factors associated with the same. Finally we assessed if the diastolic dysfunction improved following kidney transplantation. Methods: Cohort of pediatric patients with CKD were identified from medical records, retrospectively. Clinical data, echocardiographic data and outcomes data were collected. Diastolic function was assessed using echocardiography based on standard ASE guidelines. Appropriate analyses performed. Results: Total of 237 patients with CKD/ESRD were identified including 64 patients who underwent renal transplant and 84 on dialysis. Mean age was 14 years (7.6 to 17.5). Systolic hypertension was present in 49.7% while diastolic hypertension in 36.1%. 22% had a BMI greater than 95% percentile. Echocardiographic assessment showed preserved systolic function in majority (mean ejection fraction of 67.8%, range 19-90%). However, LV mass index(LVMI) was 38 g/m2.7 in 66% (115/173). Tissue Doppler velocities demonstrated a large variation with significant abnormalities indicating abnormal myocardial performance and diastolic dysfunction. Especially, notable was the Mitrale velocity which was diminished in 79% while severely diminished in 31%. Other indices including Mitral a, s and E/e' velocities as well as mean were abnormal in varying portion of population. Serial measures showed a gradual increase in E/e' ratio mean from 8.1 to 9.9 and increase in LVMI from mean of 44.5 to 53.1 g/m2.7 (p<0.05). Lastly, patients who have undergone a kidney transplantation have significantly higher Mitral e' velocities, representing improved relaxation function. (11.63 vs 12.09 p<0.05) Conclusion: This is the largest study to date of demonstrating a significant, potentially undertreated, cardiovascular burden in patients with CKD in the form of hypertrophy as well as abnormalities of myocardial performance and diastolic function. Serial measures show the parameters correlate with disease state. Further analysis in underway to identify risk factors and propose guidelines for serial screening.

N2  - Aim: We aimed to examine the association between habitual proanthocyanidin intake and presence of aortic calcification and carotid plaque in older community-dwelling women with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Background: Patients with CKD are at over a 2-fold higher risk of vascular calcification, which is a major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this population because it directly contributes to myocardial ischaemia and fibrosis. The presence of vascular calcification is associated with a higher risk of all-cause and CVD mortality in the general population and in those with CKD. Diets rich in proanthocyanidins have been shown to reduce the risk of vascular outcomes but the association with vascular calcification remains unknown. Methods: This was a prospective, population based cohort study of 300 older women over the age of 70 with baseline eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Consumption of proanthocyanidin was determined using a validated food frequency questionnaire and the United States Department of Agriculture proanthocyanidin food content database. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) scores were calculated using a validated 24-point scale using lateral spine images from bone densitometry and carotid plaque was assessed by B-mode carotid ultrasound. Associations between tertiles of proanthocyanidin intake and presence of AAC and carotid plaque were determined using adjusted logistic regression models. Results: The mean (SD) age of the women was 75.5 (2.7) years. The incidence of AAC was highest in women in the lowest tertile of proanthocyanidin intake (85.7%) compared to those in the highest tertile (74.7%, χ2 7.36, p = 0.025). Compared to the highest tertile of proanthocyanidin intake, the lowest tertile of proanthocyanidin intake was associated with over a 2.5-fold greater risk of having AAC (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.51, 95% CI 1.08-5.83, p = 0.032) but not carotid plaque (adjusted HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.43-1.48, p = 0.471), independent of age, diabetes, eGFR and prevalent CVD. Conclusions: Proanthocyanidin intake may have a protective role against the development of vascular calcification in older women with CKD. The lack of association between proanthocyanidin intake and carotid plaque may suggest a differential effect of proanthocyanidin on the pathogenesis of calcification and atherosclerosis.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification contributes to cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis (HD) patients with diabetes. The randomized controlled trial reported here compared the effects of lanthanum carbonate (LC) and calcium carbonate (CC) on vascular stiffness assessed using brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV), intima-media thickness (IMT), bone mineral density (BMD), and serum markers of chronic kidney disease – mineral and bone disorder in such patients. Methods: Ba-PWV, IMT, BMD, and the biomarkers osteocalcin (OC) and bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) were examined in 43 type 2 diabetes HD patients treated with LC (n=21) or CC (n=22) for 2 years. Results: Forty-one patients completed the study (19, LC; 22, CC). The mean ba-PWV significantly increased only in the CC group (median: 2,280.5 to 2,402.5 cm/s, P<0.05), after 24-month treatment; it remained unchanged in the LC group (median: 1,830.5 to 2,018.3 cm/s). However, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance. Changes in IMT and BMD were not different between the two groups. Changes in serum phosphorus, corrected calcium, and intact parathyroid hormone levels were similar between the groups. The incidence of fracture was 0% (0/19) in the LC group, and 13.6% (3/22) in the CC group (P=0.2478). The OC/BAP ratio increased significantly in the LC group (median: 0.83 to 2.47), compared with in the CC group (median: 0.77 to 1.40) (P=0.036). Conclusion: From this study, in Japanese type 2 diabetes HD patients, we conclude that 2-year treatment with LC might have slowed the progression of ba-PWV; however, it did not cause a difference in ba-PWV, IMT, BMD, or fracture, compared with CC. Further, LC increased the OC/BAP ratio to a greater extent than CC.

N2  - BACKGROUND-AIM Fetuin-A is an abundant serum protein involved in the inhibition of mineral precipitation in vitro and in vivo and thus in preventing vascular calcification. Its role has been extensively studied in chronic kidney disease, in which the alteration of mineral metabolism together with the documented low serum Fetuin-A may prompt to ectopic calcification, while it is not clear if it could play a role in coronary artery calcification as well as in atherosclerosis in subjects with normal kidney function. METHODS Fifty-five asymptomatic patients with one or more traditional risk factor were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were: known coronary artery disease, severe liver, pulmonary, kidney, oncologic or infectious diseases. IMT was detected by high resolution ultrasound. CAC was evaluated according to Agatston score detected by CT scan. Fetuin-A was measured by ELISA. AHSG genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS The mean age of study participants was 60 ± 10.5 years; 33% were males; 20% were smokers; 24% were obese; 67% suffered from hypertension; 65% were hyperlipidemic; 70% had familiarity for CVD; 22% suffered from diabetes; mean BMI was 27.9 ± 4.1. Serum Fetuin-A was 40.9 ± 8 ng/ml; serum Ca and P were 9.43 ± 0.5 mg/dl and 3.37 ± 0.4 mg/ dl, respectively. Serum Fetuin-A was significantly correlated with IMT (r=0.40, P=0.0041) and with the presence of carotid plaque (r=0.35, P=0.0097) but not with coronary artery calcification. The frequency of AHSG 256S allele was 0.33. Subjects with S256S genotype had lower serum Fetuin-A levels than T256T subjects (P=0.037) but not higher IMT. CONCLUSION Fetuin-A is associated to IMT in asymptomatic patients but not to coronary artery calcification, suggesting that Fetuin- A could be involved in the atherosclerotic process instead of mineral deposition on vasculature per se. AHSG T256S polymorphism affected serum Fetuin-a but it has no effect on IMT.

N2  - Aim: The relationship between inflammation and vascular calcification in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is unclear. The goal of our research work was to assess the association between inflammation markers (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), von Willebrand factor (vWf), total and differential types of leukocyte count) and abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in patients with PAD. Methods: A total of 1800 patients with PAD were examined. PAD was defined as an ABI<0.9 in at least 1 leg. The occurrence of AAC was obtained in 504 (28%) patients with PAD (381 (76%) male and 123 (24%) female) without diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure. AAC was detected by CT imaging. Total leukocyte count (TLC), monocyte count, neutrophil count, fibrinogen level, CRP and vWf levels were measured. Control group was included 1296 PAD patients without objective signs of AAC. Results: AAC was strong associated with high monocyte count (p<0.001). Differences in neutrophil count and TLC between groups were not statistically significant (p=0.065). Fibrinogen level, CRP and vWf levels were 7.4±0.8 g/l, 9.7±1.6 mg/l, 186.1±48.2% in the AAC group vs. 4.6±1.2 g/l, 5.6±0.6 mg/l, 99.5±22.6% in the non-AAC group, respectively (p<0.01). Those correlations were significant after adjustment for traditional risk factor of AAC. Conclusion: Our study suggests that inflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of aortic calcification. The present study shows that increasing of monocyte count and levels of other serum inflammation markers (fibrinogen, CRP, vWf) are significantly associated with the presence of AAC.

N2  - Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with the presence and progression of vascular and cardiac valve calcification. Vascular calcification may promote the reversal of arterial stiffness mismatch. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between cardiac valve calcification and aortic-brachial arterial stiffness mismatch in pre-dialysis hypertensive CKD patients. Design and method: The study included 112 adult treated hypertensive CKD patients: 54 - with CKD IIIa (age 59,5±8,4 years, male 46,3%, BP 149,6±10,3/85,8±9,8 mmHg), 35 - with CKD IIIb (age 60,2±7,8 years, male 45,7%, BP 152,5±12,5/86,4±10,2 mmHg) and 23 with CKDIV (age 57,3±10,2, male 43,4%, BP 156,1±14,3/92,8±12,4 mmHg). The aortic-brachial arterial stiffness mismatch (pulse wave velocity (PWV ratio) were assessed using carotidfemoral PWV divided by carotid-radial PWV. On 2Dechocardiography mitral valve calcification was graded according to the Wilkins score index, aortic valve calcification scoring was done empirically (1 - partial calcification on single cusp; 2 - partial calcification on 2 cusps; 3 - extended calcification on 2 cusps; 4 - extended calcification on all 3 cusps). P < 0,05 was considered significant for group comparisons, Spearman correlation test and multivariate regression analysis. Results: In CKD IIIa, IIIb and IV mitral valve calcification score of grade 1 was observed in 41% 28% and 22%, respectively, of grade 2 - in 50%, 60% and 65%, respectively, of grade 3 - 0, 6% and 13%, respectively. Aortic valve calcification score 1 was found in 6%, 3% and 0, respectively, score 2 - 44%, 31% and 9, respectively, score 3 - in 50%, 60% and 65%, respectively, score 4 - 0, 6%and 26%, respectively. Average cardiac valve calcification score in CKD IIIa was 2,6 + 0,2, in CKDIIIb 2,8 + 0,3,inCKDIV - 3,6 + 0,2 (p < 0,05 vsCKDIIIa).PWVratio InCKD IIIa was 0,82±0,25, CKD IIIb - 0,90±0,27, in CKD IV 1,09±0,33 (p < 0,05 vs CKD IIIa). For the whole study population (n = 112) multivariate analysis revealed independent significant correlation between cardiac valve calcification score and PWV ratio β=0,38 (p < 0,05). Conclusions: In the pre-dialysis hypertensive CKD patients cardiac valve calcification score associated with loss of arterial stiffness mismatch.

N2  - Objective: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with the presence and progression of vascular and cardiac valve calcification. Vascular calcification may promote the reversal of arterial stiffness mismatch and thus development and progression of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between cardiac valve calcification and aortic-brachial arterial stiffness mismatch in pre-dialysis hypertensive CKD patients. Methods: The cross-sectional study included 112 adult treated hypertensive CKD patients: 54 - with CKD IIIa (age 59,5±8,4 years, male 46,3%, brachial blood pressure (BP) 149,6±10,3/85,8±9,8 mmHg), 35 - with CKD IIIb (age 60,2±7,8 years, male 45,7%, BP 152,5±12,5/86,4±10,2 mmHg) and 23 with CKD IV (age 57,3±10,2, male 43,4%, BP 156,1±14,3/92,8±12,4 mmHg). The aortic-brachial arterial stiffness mismatch (pulse wave velocity (PWV ratio) were assessed using carotid-femoral PWV divided by carotid-radial PWV.

N2  - Background: Patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis (HD) therapy have abnormal bone metabolism due to hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism. This abnormality results not only in bone disease, but also a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and reduced event-free survival through vascular calcification. Habitual physical activity has a positive influence on bone metabolism in the general population. However, it is unclear how physical activity affects bone metabolism in HD patients. Purpose: This study aimed to examine the association between habitual physical activity and bone metabolism in HD patients. Methods: A total of 308 HD outpatients who visited a HD center 3 times a week were assessed for eligibility to be included in this cross-sectional study. Exclusion criteria were: hospitalization within 3 months before the study; premenopausal women; cancer; amputation of lower extremity; or requiring assistance in walking from another person. Clinical characteristics (age, sex, body mass index [BMI], and HD vintage), biochemical parameters (levels of serum albumin [Alb], serum phosphorus [P], corrected calcium [Ca], and intact parathyroid hormone [i-PTH]), and medication (active vitamin D, calcium carbonate, cinacalcet hydrochloride, and phosphate binders) were obtained from clinical records. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) was assessed as a proxy for bone turnover. Habitual physical activity was evaluated with an accelerometer as the number of steps per day for a consecutive 5-day period. The association between physical activity and bone metabolism was assessed by Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis adjusted for clinical characteristics, biochemical parameters, and medication. To avoid over-fitting, all potential confounding factors of physical activity, which include clinical characteristics, biochemical parameters, and medication, were reduced to one composite characteristic by applying a propensity score. These analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results: A total of 103 HD patients (55 men and 48 postmenopausal women; mean age, 67.7±8.6 years; mean BMI, 21.4±3.1 kg/m2; mean HD vintage, 8.6±8.6 years; mean Alb, 3.9±0.3 g/dL; mean corrected Ca, 9.3±0.5 mg/dL; mean P, 5.0±0.9 mg/dL; mean i-PTH, 122.0±95.0 pg/mL; mean number of steps, 4153.4±2781.4 steps/day; mean BAP, 12.6±5.1 μg/L) were eligible for inclusion in this study. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient revealed that physical activity was significantly correlated with bone metabolism (r = 0.326, P < 0.01). In multiple regression analysis adjusted for clinical characteristics, biochemical parameters, and medication, physical activity was significantly associated with bone metabolism (R2 = 0.471, P < 0.01). Moreover, even after adjusting for propensity score, physical activity was significantly associated with bone metabolism (R2 = 0.445, P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that, as in the general population, habitual physical activity is significantly and independently associated with bone metabolism in HD patients. Therefore, maintaining or improving habitual physical activity should be considered an effective approach to address abnormal bone metabolism in HD patients. Implications: This study provides supporting data for evidence-based physical therapy to address abnormal bone metabolism in HD patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is linked to abnormal bone mineral metabolism. We aim to evaluate the association between peripheral VC (pVC) and bone micro-architecture using HR-pQCT in advanced CKD. Methods: We recruited 50 CKD stages 4-5 (including dialysis) patients and their ageand gender-matched controls with eGFR<60ml/min/1.73m2.We performed HR-pQCT (XtremeCT, Scanco) at the wrist and ankle to assess bone parameters of distal radius and tibia (82μm resolution, spanning 9.02mm). The same images (Figure 1) were used to quantify pVC mass in mg hydroxyapatite (mgHA) at both sites. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Discovery A, Hologic) and AAC-8 score. Results: Both groups had mean age of 62 years, 78% males and similar BMI. More CKD had measurable pVC than controls (92% vs 30%, p<0.001). In contrast, AAC was only measurable (i.e. AAC score<0) in 49% of CKD and 18% of controls (p= 0.001). Total pVC mass was higher in CKD with median of 3.43 (0-110.59) mgHA vs 0 (0-15.66) mgHA in controls (p<0.001). 34% of CKD had diabetes and they had higher median total pVC mass compared to CKD without diabetes (35.51mgHAvs 0.56mgHA, p<0.001). CKD had lower mean volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) at both sites compared to controls ( p<0.05). For bone micro-architecture, CKD had lower mean trabecular bone volume/tissue volume (mean BV/TV 0.13 vs 0.15, p<0.05) and thinner trabeculae (0.065mm vs 0.072mm, p<0.05) compared to controls at distal radius. At distal tibia, CKD also had lower mean cortical area (117.54mm2 vs 140.06mm2, p<0.05) and thinner cortical bone (1.03mm vs 1.25mm, p<0.005). Total pVC mass in CKD had negative correlations with cortical bone micro-architecture at both sites although stronger correlations were found at distal tibia (Table 1). The degree of correlation at distal radius in CKD was fairly similar to controls. Conclusions: CKD was associated with higher total pVC mass; even more so in CKD with diabetes. Total pVC mass in CKD was strongly associated with less cortical bone at distal tibia. HR-pQCT allows simultaneous assessment of bone microarchitecture and peripheral vascular calcification which is useful for future CKD mineral bone disorder research. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with vascular calcifications and atherosclerosis. Hyperphosphatemia is major contributor to vascular calcification. The phosphate binder, sevelamer, has been shown to prevent vascular abnormalities in CKD experimental and clinical conditions by phosphate dependent and independent effects. MicroRNA's are a class of small non-coding RNAs which are regulators of gene expression. In recent years several microRNAs involved in vascular function have also been linked to CKD-associated cardiovascular disease. We therefore decided to examine changes of miR-126, miR-143, mi-R145, miR-222 and miR-223 expression, known as cardiovascular-related miRNA's, and their target genes in aortas of CKD and non-CKD wild type mice and CKD mice treated with sevelamer-HCl. Methods: All experiments were performed in female C57BL/6J mice, in accord with the principles of the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament. We used a CKD model which included cortical electrocautery of the right kidney and 2 weeks later left total nephrectomy. Sevelamer treatment was started 2 weeks after CKD induction and continued for 8 weeks. After sacrifice, thoracic aorta was removed for total RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis. U6, a non-coding small nuclear RNA, was used as endogenous control. In parallel RT-qPCR was used to quantify vascular protein targets myocardin (MYO), Nuclear Factor I-A (NFI-A) and Glucose Transporter type 4 (GLUT-4). All measurements were performed at 3 times. Results: CKD-associated vascular damage led to down-regulation of aortic miR-143, miR-145 and miR-222 expression, and up-regulation of miR-126 and miR-223 expression. miR-126 levels decreased 1.8 and 2.0 times, and miR-223 levels 3.6 and 3.9 times, respectively, in sevelamer CKD and sevelamer sham groups vs. control CKD group. miR-143 expression increased in sevelamer CKD and sevelamer sham groups vs. control CKD group 0.6 and 1.1 times, and mi-R145 1.5 and 1.8 times, respectively. Analysis of miR-222 expression showed that, again, sevelamer treatment reduced miR-222 increase in treated mice, both sham and CKD 0.8 and 1.1 times respectively as compared to placebo-treated mice. No differences were noted between sevelamer CKD and sevelamer sham groups vs control sham for any miRNA examined. Conclusions: In conclusion, we provide evidence that sevelamer is able to correct CKD-associated anomalies of vascular microRNA expression. Our findings are in support of a direct link between abnormal microRNA expression and uremic vascular toxicity.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Blood vessels have a differential susceptibility to calcification depending on anatomical location. Although vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the regional and temporal pattern of calcium deposition across the vasculature has not been elucidated. The study objective was to determine the time course and severity of VC pathology across vascular beds in experimental CKD. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on a CKD diet (0.25% adenine) for 3 weeks (n=8, creatinine: 127 ± 66uM), 5 weeks (n=15, creatinine: 391 ± 66uM) and 7 weeks (n=40, creatinine: 268 ± 121 uM). Results: 3 wks of CKD did not yield VC in any vascular bed assessed. However, after 5 and 7 wks on CKD diet respectively: 21% vs. 33% of animals developed VC in the thoracic aorta, 36% vs. 51% in the abdominal aorta, 31% vs. 42% in the carotid artery, and 72% vs. 65% in the internal pudendal artery. These data indicate substantial heterogeneity across vascular beds in their susceptibility to calcification in CKD. To further characterize the pathogenesis of VC, CKD rats (7 wks 0.25% adenine, SD rats) were placed on a low (20 ng/kg/day, n=24, creatinine: 211 ± 63uM) or a high dose of calcitriol (80ng/kg/day, n=24, creatinine: 201 ± 45 uM) to generate a range of VC severity. The animals were grouped into a single cohort and then stratified by the presence of VC in the thoracic aorta. When VC was not yet present in the thoracic aorta, calcium content was already significantly elevated above control levels in the iliac artery (45.9 fold), renal artery (12.6 fold), and internal pudendal artery (12.6 fold; p<0.05). However, when VC was present in the TA, the rank order for the capacity for calcium accumulation (nmol/mg tissue, fold increase above control) was from proximal to distal: thoracic aorta (400x), abdominal aorta (314x), iliac artery (214x), renal artery (118x), internal pudendal artery (64x; p<0.05). Conclusions: Together these findings in experimental CKD indicate that there is substantial heterogeneity in both the regional susceptibility to VC, but also in the capacity for total calcium accumulation. Although the peripheral vasculature calcifies prior to vasculature, i.e. those proximal to the heart, the larger vessels (e.g. aorta and iliac) have a significantly greater capacity for calcification than the distal vessels. Differences in embryonic origin as well as the vessel structure (e.g. wall thickness, extracellular matrix composition) likely play a significant role in the variations in susceptibility.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: There are many mediators of inflammation in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including atherosclerosis and cytokines. Inflammation contributes to the progression of CKD by inducing the release of cytokines, and also causes mortality from cardiovascular disease by contributing to the development of vascular calcifications and endothelial dysfunction. Visfatin is a newly identified cytokine that released especially in inflammation from adipose tissue. Recent studies indicated that visfatin may have potential proinflammatory effect. In this study we investigated whether serum visfatin levels is altered in patients with CKD, and compared inflammation markers between patients with and without carotid atherosclerosis. Methods: A total of 50 non-dialyzed patients with CKD stage 4 or 5 and 31 healthy subjects enrolled in this study. We measured serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, visfatin, procalcitonin (PCT) and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels. Common carotid arteries intima-media thickness (IMT) and atherosclerotic plaque were detected by non-invasive high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography. Results: Compared with healthy controls, patients with CKD had same gender distribution (22 vs. 18 female), older age (median 46.5 vs. 32 years), lower albumin (median 3.75 vs. 4.2 g/dL), HDL (37.3±12.4 vs. 46.7±8.7 mg/dL), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and hemoglobin levels, and higher body mass index (BMI) (29.3 ±2.8 vs. 25.5±4.6 kg/m2), trygliceride (median 184 vs. 98 mg/dL), visfatin (median 30.9 vs. 19 ng/mL), hsCRP (0.34 vs. 0.33 ng/mL) and PCT (0.23 vs. 0.05 ng/mL) (p<0.001). Also the carotid IMT in patients with CKD was higher than control groups (median 0.8 vs. 0.5 mm, p<0.001). In all study population, carotid IMT was positively correlated with age, BMI, visfatin, hsCRP, PCT, trygliceride and ferritin levels, and negatively correlated with eGFR, hemoglobin and HDL levels. Serum visfatin, hsCRP and PCT levels of 30 persons with carotid atherosclerosis were higher than those of 50 persons without carotid atherosclerosis (38.2±14.6 vs. 22.1±10.5 ng/mL, 1.88±3.31 vs. 0.49 ±0.39 ng/mL and 0.38±0.49 vs. 0.13±0.16 ng/mL, respectively, p<0.001). Serum visfatin of 28 CKD patients with carotid atherosclerosis were higher than those of 22 CKD patients without carotid atherosclerosis (37.8±15 vs. 25.6±14.3 ng/mL, p<0.001), but not hsCRP and PCT levels. Conclusions: Our results showed that serum visfatin, PCT and hsCRP levels was increased in non-dialyzed with CKD stage 4 or 5 and healthy persons who had carotid atherosclerosis. Visfatin may be an inflammatory marker of CKD patients with atherosclerosis.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Functional deficiency of vitamin K (both vitamin K1 and K2), involved in the process of γ-carboxylation is postulated as one of the most relevant links between the chronic kidney disease and vascular calcification among hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to determine the level of functional vitamin K deficiency and its relation to vitamin K1 intake in HD patients. Methods: Protein induced vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) and uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein (ucMGP) were assessed by ELISA in 153 stable, prevalent HD patients and 20 apparently healthy adults (for PIVKA-II and ucMGP normal ranges establishment). Daily phylloquinone intake were assessed in addition to other macro- and micronutrients on the basis of food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Results: Functional vitamin K deficiency defined as elevated PIVKA II levels was present in 27.5% of HD patients, and in 45% of cases was explained by insufficient phylloquinone intake for Polish population (> 55 μg for women and > 65 μg for men). Applying ROC analysis we showed that vitamin K1 intake below 40.2 μg/day is associated with functional vitamin K deficiency. There was no correlation between plasma concentration of PIVKA II and ucMGP, that suggest that functional vitamin K deficiency does not influence ucMGP levels among HD patients. Plasma ucMGP concentrations were significantly greater in among HD patients than in healthy subjects (17.9 [16.3 - 19.5] vs. 7.1 [5.1 - 9.2] mg/mL; p<0.001). Conclusions: 1. Functional vitamin K deficiency in almost half of the population of haemodialysis patients is caused by low vitamin K1 intake. 2. Uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein level seems not to be a surrogate of functional vitamin K1 deficiency in haemodialysis patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The study aim was to determine whether magnesium alone or combined magnesium and calcitriol treatments differentially impact the susceptibility to vascular calcification (VC) in experimental CKD. Methods: Male SD rats were maintained on an adenine diet (0.25%) for 7 wks. Animals were stratified by creatinine into 4 groups at 3 weeks. For the next 4 wks, each group was maintained on: (1) CKD-CON ( n=16), (2) MAG (0.2% Mg food, n=16), (3) CAL (calcitriol, 80ng/kg/day, n=16), or (4) CAL+MAG (calcitriol (80ng/kg/ day) + 0.2% Mg food, n=16). Results: The serum creatinine was similar between groups (232±91 uM). Compared to CKD-CON, serum calcium was significantly elevated in the CAL and CAL + MAG groups. Serum magnesium was significantly elevated in the MAG, CAL+MAG and CAL groups.With calcitriol treatment, PTH was significantly suppressed (6X decrease) and FGF-23 was significantly elevated (∼10X increase) compared to the non-CAL groups ( p<0.05). There was a significant increase in the prevalence of VC in the calcitriol treated groups (CAL and CAL+MAG) compared to the CKD-CON and the MAG treatment groups (p50 nmol/mg tissue), compared to the CKD-CON and MAG groups where only 50-75% had VC (depending on the arterial bed). To determine the impact of calcitriol and magnesium on VC severity, only animals with von Kossa stainable VC (>50nmol/mg tissue calcium) were included in the analysis. There was a significant reduction (50%) in the calcium content (VC severity) in the CAL+MAG group compared to the CAL in the abdominal aorta, and iliac, carotid, and superior mesenteric arteries (p<0.05). As expected, the Ca/Mg ratio was significantly suppressed (50%) in the CAL+MAG compared to CAL in the abdominal aorta, and iliac, carotid, and superior mesenteric arteries, indicating there is twice as much magnesium in the microenvironment, compared to calcium ( p<0.05). To determine whether the TRPM7 channel played a role in magnesium accrual, mRNA and protein levels were measured in abdominal aorta. CAL significantly reduced TRPM7 protein content in the abdominal aorta compared to CKD-CON and MAG; however, the TRPM7 mRNA and protein content was significantly greater in the combined CAL+MAG than the CAL group (p<0.05). MAG alone significantly reduced VC severity and reduced the Ca/Mg ratio only in the superior mesenteric artery (p<0.05). There was no difference in TRPM7 protein content or mRNA expression in the aorta between the CKD-CON and MAG groups. Conclusions: These results show that calcitriol in some circumstances increases VC; however, addition of magnesium can attenuate it. CAL is associated with reduced TRPM7 expression in the aorta, an effect which was attenuated by MAG co-treatment. The benefit of magnesium may involve preventing a reduction in TRPM7 protein expression and, thus, an increase in bioavailable magnesium in the vascular microenvironment.

N2  - Introduction: Calcification of vessels - mainly in the tunica media - with additional demineralisation of bone is typical for patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this project, we analyse samples from CKD patients with a focus on microRNAs (miRNAs) as new biomarkers for vascular calcification. Our aim is to find a pattern of miRNAs indicating vascular calcification and/or mineralisation changes in the course of the disease and after kidney transplantation. Methods: Serum and plasma samples of 73 patients in CKD stages 3 - 5; 67 post RT (renal transplantation) patients as well as 36 healthy controls are analysed in the study. Additional 25 patients in CKD stage 5 were prospectively followed before, and already some of them during and after RT. Known biomarkers for calcification have been measured using ELISA techniques. A miRNA profile of CKD patients compared to healthy controls has been established using a nCounter® miRNA Expression Assay. Deregulated miRNAs were further analysed in qPCR experiments. Results: PTH, FGF23 and osteocalcin were significantly increased in late stage CKD patients. When analysing more than 800 miRNAs, significant differences were found in 37 of them when comparing CKD patients of stage 5 and healthy controls. These miRNAs were related to vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) biology and bone metabolism. 12 miRNAs of them were followed for further analysis. In subsequent experiments especially 4 miRNAs emerged showing a different expression level comparing the patient and control groups. Discussion: miRNAs have been shown to have a biological association to vascular calcification, bone metabolism or differentiation of VSMCs to osteoblast-like cells. They are deregulated to a considerable extent in CKD patients. These pathways may be important during the development of calcified and vascular tissue in the course of kidney disease. MiRNA signatures could become early diagnostic markers indicating the risk of vascular calcification or bone demineralisation in this high risk group.

N2  - Vascular calcification, a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease, involves a variety of mechanisms associated with the regulation of calcification‑associated factors. Previous clinical studies have indicated that magnesium is involved in the reduction of vascular calcification; however, the mechanism underlying this process remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of magnesium on β‑glycerophosphate (β‑GP)-induced calcification and the underlying mechanisms. Primary rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were exposed to 10 mM β‑GP in medium with or without the addition of 3 mM magnesium or 2‑aminoethoxy‑diphenylborate (2‑APB; an inhibitor of magnesium transport), for a 14‑day period. Calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were measured by Alizarin red staining, quantification of calcium and enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay. The expression levels of core‑binding factor α‑1 (Cbfα1), matrix Gla protein (MGP) and osteopontin (OPN) were determined by reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction or western blot analysis, following incubation for 0, 3, 6, 10 and 14 days with the different media. VSMC calcification and ALP activity was reduced significantly in the high‑magnesium medium compared with the calcification medium, during the 14‑day incubation. The magnesium‑induced changes in the VSMCs included a β‑GP‑induced downregulation of Cbfα1 by day 3 of incubation, an effect that was gradually enhanced over the 14‑day period. By contrast, magnesium produced notable increases in MGP and OPN expression levels, with an opposite pattern to that observed in the Cbfα1 expression levels. However, the addition of 2‑APB appeared to inhibit the protective effect of magnesium on the VSMCs. Therefore, magnesium was able to effectively reduce β‑GP‑induced calcification in rat VSMCs by regulating the expression levels of calcification‑associated factors in a time‑dependent manner.

N2  - Increased stiffness of large arteries in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has significant clinical implications. This study investigates the temporal development of thoracic aortic dysfunction in a rodent model of CKD, the Lewis polycystic kidney (LPK) rat. Animals aged 12 and 18 weeks were studied alongside age-matched Lewis controls (total n = 94). LPK rodents had elevated systolic blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy and progressively higher plasma creatinine and urea. Relative to Lewis controls, LPK exhibited reduced maximum aortic vasoconstriction (R<inf>max</inf>) to noradrenaline at 12 and 18 weeks, and to K<sup>+</sup> (12 weeks). Sensitivity to noradrenaline was greater in 18-week-old LPK vs. age matched Lewis (effective concentration 50%: 24 × 10<sup>-9</sup> ± 78 × 10<sup>-10</sup> vs. 19 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ± 49 × 10<sup>-9</sup>, P < 0.05). Endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside) relaxation was diminished in LPK, declining with age (12 vs. 18 weeks R<inf>max</inf>: 80 ± 8% vs. 57 ± 9% and 92 ± 6% vs. 70 ± 9%, P < 0.05, respectively) in parallel with the decline in renal function. L-Arginine restored endothelial function in LPK, and L-NAME blunted acetylcholine relaxation in all groups. Impaired nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was recovered with L-Arginine plus L-NAME in 12, but not 18-week-old LPK. Aortic calcification was increased in LPK rats, as was collagen I/III, fibronectin and NADPH-oxidase subunit p47 (phox) mRNAs. Overall, our observations indicate that the vascular abnormalities associated with CKD are progressive in nature, being characterized by impaired vascular contraction and relaxation responses, concurrent with the development of endothelial dysfunction, which is likely driven by evolving deficits in NO signaling.

N2  - Context: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest that activated Wnt signaling contributes to VC. Objective: The objective was to investigate whether circulating levels of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with progression of VC. Design: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal observational Brussels Renal Transplant Cohort study. Setting: The setting was a tertiary care academic hospital. Patients: Coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification were measured by multislice spiral computerized tomography in 268 prevalent RTRs (age, 53 ± 13 y; 61% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189 patients after a median follow-up of 4.4 years. Baseline serum sclerostin levels were assessed on stored blood samples. Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of baseline VC and progression. Main outcome measure: The main outcome measure was progression of VC. Results: VC was present in up to 84% of participants at baseline. Almost half of the patients showed progression of VC, according to Hokanson criteria. The cross-sectional analysis at baseline demonstrated a direct association between sclerostin levels and VC score in univariate analysis, which became inverse after adjustment for age, gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level was identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline aorta calcification score in the final regression model. Moreover, baseline sclerostin levels showed an inverse association with VC progression, at least after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Conclusions: Serum sclerostin levels inversely associated with VC burden and progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Our data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted chronic kidney disease patients and support the notion that sclerostin may be up-regulated in the vascular wall during the VC process as part of a local counterregulatory mechanism directed to suppress VC. Additional clinical and experimental data are required for confirmation.

N2  - Introduction: Hyperphosphatemia has been identified as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in chronic kidney disease patients. Higher serum phosphorus (P) concentration can cause both endothelial dysfunction and vascular calcification. Dietary P restriction and P binders are available for correction of hyperphosphatemia, however, it has not been clarified if both treatments can similarly ameliorate vascular complecations, especially endothelial dysfunction, as well as mineral disorders in CKD patients or not. Hypothesis: Here, we compared lanthanum carbonate as a P binder with dietary P restriction on the correction of hyperphosphatemia and endothelial dysfunction in adenine-induced chronic kidney disease rats. Methods: Adenine-induced CKD model rats were prepared by feeding 0.5% adenine containing diet for 35 days on male 7-wk-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Then, the adenine-induced CKD rats were divided 5 groups and treated with either control diet (CP; 1%P), low P diet (LP; 0.2%P), 1.5% lanthanum carbonate (La1.5; 1%P, 1.5%LaCO3), 3% lanthanum carbonate (La3; 1%P, 3%LaCO3), or 6% lanthanum carbonate (La6; 1%P, 6%LaCO3) for 14 days. After sacrifice, plasma P, intact-PTH, FGF23, and creatinine were measured. We evaluated acetylcholine-dependent vasodilation of aortic ring by isometric transducers, and F4/80 positive cells and MCP-1 expression on aortic arch by immunohistochemical analysis. Results: Hyperphosphatemia, high PTH and FGF23 levels were similarly and significantly corrected in LP and La6 groups compared with CP group. LP and La6 groups similarly and significantly ameliorated impaired vasodilation in response to acetylcholine. However, correction of hyperphosphatemia was not enough in La1.5 and La3 groups so that impaired vasodilation was not significantly ameliorated. LP and La6 groups also decreased F4/80 positive cells and MCP-1 expression on aortic arch. Conclusions: Correction of hyperphosphatemia by either dietary P restriction or lanthanum carbonate can similarly ameliorate vascular complecations and mineral disorders including abnormal PTH and FGF23 observed in adenine-induced CKD rats.

N2  - Purpose: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been linked to endothelial dysfunction, elevated pulse pressure, increased carotid artery intima-media thickness and vascular calcification. Elevated PTH levels in terms of secondary hyperparathyroidism have been found in patients with chronic kidney disease. Studies evaluating the relationship between PTH and risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients with normal kidney function are, however, sparse. We therefore aimed to evaluate the relationship between PTH and long term CV mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: A total of 1036 patients with ACS and measurement of PTH at baseline were included in the analyses. Data was extracted from the LUdwigshafen RIsk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study (1997-2000). Serum PTH was measured by an ElectroChemiLuminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) on an Elecsys2010. Statistical models were carefully evaluated for normal distribution (including log-transformation, where appropriate), collinearity and residuals. Results: Patients (age: 63.7±10.4years; 51.2% females, median follow up: 9.9years) had reasonable CAD burden with 24.5% one-, 26.5% two- and 40.4% multi-vessel disease (a stenosis of 50% or greater was considered significant). In Cox proportional hazard analysis (with backward elimination procedure) adjusted for age, sex, systolic blood pressure, waist to hip ratio log, diabetes, active smoking, eGFR-MDRD, left-ventricular function, extent of CAD and LDL-C, PTH was significantly associated with increased CV mortality (P=0.007; HR 2.67, 95%CI 1.30-5.47). Further adjustments for HDL, resting heart rate log, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, statins, oral anticoagulation and physical activity as well as the exclusion of patients with severe chronic-kidney disease (CKD) stages 4-5 (n=269; mean eGFR: 23.6±7.2ml/min/1,73m2) did not materially change this association (P=0.045; HR 2.30, 95%CI 1.02-5.18). Conclusions: In patients with ACS, PTH is strongly related to CV mortality, independent of kidney function. Mechanistic approaches are warranted to elucidate mechanisms of PTH interfering treatment strategies in patients at CVD risk.

N2  - Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), erectile dysfunction (ED), and cardiovascular disease share common vascular etiologies and risk factors. Aim: Using a rat model, this is the first study to characterize the consequences of CKD in the onset and development of ED associated with differential regional vascular calcification and circulatory changes. Methods: Stable CKD was generated at 3weeks in male Sprague-Dawley rats given dietary adenine and progressed until 7weeks. Mineral content and morphometry were assessed in the internal pudendal arteries (IPAs), thoracic aorta, and carotid artery. Endothelial function was determined via changes in serum von Willebrand factor (VWF) and endothelium-dependent relaxation of the thoracic aorta. Results: In severe CKD rats, calcium and phosphate content in all arteries increased, and pulse wave velocity was elevated. Distal IPA segments, in particular, were the first to calcify, but penile tissue per se did not. CKD rats had endothelial dysfunction, as indicated by a decrease in acetylcholine-mediated relaxation (∼40%) and an increase in serum VWF (∼40%), as well as increased lumen diameter (20%) of the distal IPA. Erectile function, assessed using a centrally acting dopaminergic agent, was significantly impaired by 7weeks (∼40%). Conclusions: In CKD, the distal IPA appears to be more susceptible to vascular dysfunction and calcification. Additionally, the onset of ED may be an important sentinel of impending systemic vascular disease. To confirm this concept, future experimental and clinical studies will need to examine a range of vessel types and the use of supplementary methods to assess erectile function. © 2014 International Society for Sexual Medicine.

N2  - Introduction: In chronic kidney disease, high FGF-23 serum levels are induced by hyperphosphatemia. Elevated FGF-23 levels are linked to poor skeletal mineralization and adverse outcomes including vascular calcification and mortality. Recently, it was shown that FGF-23 levels are substantially elevated in acute kidney injury (AKI), and that higher levels in AKI are associated with a greater risk of adverse outcomes as well. Methods: In 25 medical adult critically ill patients (63±16 years, 76 % men) with and without AKI, markers of vitamin D, bone and mineral metabolism (25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, ionized and total serum calcium, phosphorus, bone specific alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase, ß-crosslaps) were measured. FGF-23 measurements were made using a C-terminal FGF-23 ELISA (Immutopics, San Clemente). Results: Serum FGF-23 levels were significantly higher in patients with AKI (median 2720 RU/ml, range 351-8708) compared to patients without AKI (n=8, 150 RU/ml, 55-14000; p<0.001) and nonsignificantly higher in nonsurvivors (n=12, 624 RU/ml, 61-8709) compared to survivors (312 RU/ml, 55- 14000, p=0.453). There was no significant correlation between FGF-23 and any of the measured biochemical markers. Discussion: In our small cohort of medical critically ill patients, FGF-23 levels were substantially higher than in other reported populations. In patients with AKI these were significantly higher than in patients without AKI. There was no significant correlation of FGF-23 and any of the determined markers of bone and mineral metabolism, although this may primarily be a matter of small sample size, as the correlation coefficient was strongest for serum phosphorus, ionized calcium and osteocalcin and reached values of 0.25-0.28. In conclusion, the role of FGF-23 in critical illness remains unclear and further studies on this topic are warranted.

N2  - We present calciphylaxsis, a rare condition most often in end stage renal disease (ESRD) involving subcutaneous vascular calcification and necrosis associated with progressive and painful ulcerations. A 70 year old obese female with stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD) for 5 years secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis, presented with painful skin lesions that started on her buttock and lower extremities. The lesions initially were indurated cutaneous plaques that were noticed 5 weeks prior and later progressed to eschar that spread to her left thigh. Based on presentation and risk factors, there was a high index of suspicion for calciphylaxsis. The patient was started on sodium thiosulfate and hemodialysis (HD) with notable improvement as an outpatient. 3 weeks later, she was admitted to an outside hospital for staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia for which she completed a 2 week course of vancomycin. On admission, the patient's vital signs were within normal limits. Lab values were notable for a low PTH at 53pg/ml, total serum calcium of 8.4mg/dL, serum phosphorous of 4.2mg/dL, and calcium phosphate product (CPP) of 36mg/dL. WBC count was 10.6 K/ul without a left shift. Over the subsequent hours after admission, her condition rapidly deteriorated and the patient later expired. The following day 2/2 blood cultures done from admission were positive for staphylococcus epidermidis. Calciphylaxsis carries a mortality rate of up to 80%, most commonly from sepsis. The skin lesions are prone to infection. Despite completing a full course of antibiotics, our patient again succumbed to sepsis. Clinicians should be alerted to the potential of superimposed infections. Further research is needed into the pathogenesis of calciphylaxsis which will lead to new therapies and less complications.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Pathogenic vascular calcification (VC) in CKD, likely resulting from altered phosphate and calcium metabolism, is a critical harbinger of CVD in these patients. A growing body of evidence now indicates that vitamin K, via its key role as a substrate for γ-glutamyl carboxylase, plays a protective role in this progression. Methods: In this study, the objective was to compare the effect of modifying vitamin K status on calcium accrual in tissue from both healthy and in CKD rats (0.25% adenine in diet, 7 wks). In separate groups of male Sprague Dawley rats (n=80), vitamin K status was either increased (high vitamin K1, 100 mg/kg diet) or decreased (warfarin, 0.08-0.1 mg/kg body weight/day). Of particular interest was the impact on the initiation of calcification. To assess this, thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, renal, carotid and pudendal arteries tissues were matched for tissue phosphate levels for both control and CKD tissues, with the objective to determine whether there were differences in calcium accrual. Segments of thoracic aorta from healthy and CKD rats were also excised and placed in vitro (3.8 mM PO4) to examine their susceptibility to vascular calcification. Results: In the CKD rats, warfarin treatment induced a >two fold increase (p<0.05) in calcium accumulation compared to controls even at very low levels of tissue phosphate 5-10 (2.12 fold increase), and 10-15 nmol/mg (2.45 fold increase). This marked increase was completely prevented with vitamin K supplementation (100 mg/kg). The CKD group receiving a low, but not deficient, vitamin K (0.1-0.2 mg/kg diet) had higher vessel calcium levels than controls at 10-15 nmol/mg tissue phosphate (2.51 fold increase; p<0.05). In vitro, thoracic aortas from CKD and non-CKD rats with low tissue phosphate levels (0-15 mmol/mg) were placed in a high phosphate media. At day 4, the calcium content in vessels from the high K groups were significantly lower than both warfarin and low K treatments ( p<0.05). Assessment of the data from in vitro studies, with a linear regression analysis, indicates that for a given tissue phosphate, CKD vessels accrued more calcium than healthy non-CKD vessels ( p<0.0001). Conclusions: Our research clearly demonstrates that within control ranges of tissue phosphate, therapeutic warfarin causes aberrant calcium accrual, which can be completely prevented with vitamin K supplementation. Further, the in vitro evidence suggests that non-calcified CKD vessels have a unique susceptibility to VC compared to healthy controls.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Patients with chronic kidney disease have a marked increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Non-traditional risk factors, such as increased phosphate retention, and deficiencies in vitamins D and K metabolism, likely play key roles in the development of vascular calcification during CKD progression. Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K dependent protein that inhibits vascular calcification and calcitriol is a key transcriptional regulator of MGP. In this study we looked at the effect of calcitriol in the presence of enhanced vitamin K status or in the presence of vitamin K deficiency in an in vitro model of vascular calcification. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats at 12 weeks of age were treated for a total of 14 days with warfarin (0.25-0.3 mg/kg/day), normal dietary vitamin K (0.5-1 mg/kg diet), or daily gavage of vitamin K1 (2 mg/day). The thoracic aorta was harvested, cut into 3mm rings, and incubated in DMEM at 37°C for 4 days. The media contained 3.8 mM phosphate, warfarin (10 uM), no added vitamin K1 or added vitamin K1 (10 uM) either with or without calcitriol (10-10, 10-8, or 10-6 M). Carboxylated and uncarboxylated osteocalcin was measured using the Gla/Glu Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Set (Clontech Laboratories Inc, CA, USA). Vascular calcium levels were assessed in segments of thoracic aorta using the calcium-O-cresophthalein assay. Calcitriol metabolites were analyzed in the media using LC-MSMS on aWaters BEH-C18 column (1.7 micron, 2.1x50), and aWaters Acquity-Xevo-TQ-S in MRM mode (with a MeOH/H2O gradient system). Results: Rats treated with warfarin had a significant decrease in the serum % of carboxlated osteocalcin (4 ± 2.4%) compared to control (87 ± 0.5 %) or high dietary K1 (81 ± 7 %) ( p<0.01). In control rats, Calcitriol (10-10, 10-8, and 10-6 M) inhibited the development of vascular calcification at the two higher concentrations (p<0.05). 1,24,25-(OH)3D3 the CYP 24A1 generated metabolite of calcitriol was found in the incubation media. In the presence of control or high vitamin K1 calcitriol (10-8M) inhibited vascular calcification by 40-50% (p<0.05). However, in the presence of warfarin, calcitriol (10-8M) did not inhibit vascular calcification Conclusions: Calcitriol, in the presence of sufficient vitamin K, inhibits vascular calcification in an in vitro model of aortic calcification. Generation of the calcitriol metabolite confirmed the vascular tissue responded via CYP24A1-mediated metabolism. Optimizing the combination of vitamins K and D treatment could provide a useful new therapeutic approach.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Whereas the poor prognosis effect of the presence of vascular calcifications (VC) has been clearly defined in dialysis patients, their impact in the earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not well established. The present study evaluated the prevalence of the VC in non-dialysis CKD patients, its correlation with other known cardiovascular risk factors, and its value for the prediction of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Methods: OSERCE-II is a multicenter, observational, prospective, study, which enrolled 722 non-dialysis CKD subjects (3-stage: 40%; 4-stage: 46%; 5-stage: 14%; mean age: 66±13 years; women: 35%; diabetes mellitus: 37%) attending 39 hospitals in Spain from 2009 to 2012. At baseline, VC were assessed by the Adragao score (simple vascular calcification score) (AS; X-ray pelvis and hands) and the Kauppila score (KS; X-ray lateral lumbar spine). Results: VC were present in 79% of the patients, being prominent in 47% (AS ≥3: 30%; KS >6: 31%). During an observational period of 3 years there were 74 deaths (10%), 174 patients (24%) needed hospitalizations and 154 patients (21%) started dialysis treatment. Cardiovascular was the most common cause of death (42%). By multivariate analysis (adjusted by age), the factors independently associated with all-cause mortality were: Age [OR:1.091 (1.051-1.132); p<0.001], AS ≥3 [OR:2.131(1.171-3.880); p=0.013], Diabetes [OR:1.975 (1.050-3.7131); p=0.03], and phosphate [OR:1.569(1.078-2.283); p=0.018]. The independent factors associated with cardiovascular mortality were: Age [OR:1.075 (1.018-1.135); p=0.010], AS ≥3 [OR:2.772(1.078-7.126); p=0.034], Diabetes [OR:2.908 (1.131-7.477); p=0.027], and phosphate [OR:2.009 (1.108-3.639); p=0.021]. When we included in the model the presence of hands vascular calcification (digital or radial) the independent factors for mortality were: Age [OR:1.091 (1.055-1.131); p<0.001], hand calcification ≥1 [OR:1.226 (1.000-1.505); p=0.049], and phosphate [OR:1.775 (1.233-2.547); p=0.018]. The analysis for cardiovascular mortality showed: Age [OR:1.086 (1.016-1.161); p=0.015] and hand calcification ≥1 [OR:1.573 (1.124-2.202); p=0.008]. Conclusions: VC detected by plain radiography is highly prevalent in CKD patient. AS and hand calcification represent a reliable and inexpensive tool for the assessment of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in these patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification is common and progressive in chronic kidney disease, and vascular calcification increases the risk of cardiovascular events. However, in CKD patients, the extent to which vascular calcification is advanced with regards to the progression of renal failure remains to be further elucidated. The aim of the present study was to quantitatively examine factors associated with aortic calcification in predialysis CKD patients. Methods:We quantitatively investigated presence or degree of aortic calcification in 149 predialysis CKD patients (58±16 years; 96 males and 53 females, 48 diabetics; eGFR 40.3±29.3 ml/min), and measured Agatston scores using a 64-slice CT scanner (Somatom Sensation 64; Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany), in which images were obtained with a 3 mm single slice thickness. The aorta distal to the renal artery to the bifurcation was examined. Aortic calcification was defined as the volume of 2 adjacent pixels with a CT density of > 130 Hounsfield units within the distribution of the abdominal aorta. Results: Of 149 patients, aortic calcification was present in 117, and absent in 32. In patients with aortic calcification, age (p<0.001), C-reactive protein (p<0.001), and intact-PTH (p < 0.001) were significantly higher, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly lower ( p<0.001), and diabetes was observed more often ( p<0.05). In regards to the degree of aortic calcification, the Agatston scores correlated significantly and positively with age (ρ=0.438, p<0.001) and serum phosphate (ρ=0.208, p=0.024), and correlated significantly but negatively with e-GFR (ρ=-0.353, p<0.001). Agatston scores increased according with advances in the CKD stages. In multiple regression analysis, eGFR and serum phosphate were associated significantly with log [Agatston score] (β = - 0.261, p = 0.003; β = 0.147, p = 0.046, respectively) after the adjustment of several confounders (R2 = 0.333, p < 0.001; R2 = 0.295, p < 0.001, respectively). However, log [intact PTH] was not associated with log [Agatston score] after the adjustment. eGFR was associated significantly and independently with the log [Agatston score] (β=-0.346, p<0.01), after adjustment for several confounders including age, gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, log [CRP], smoking, serum phosphate, and log [intact-PTH] (R2 = 0.301, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Hyperphospatemia, chronic inflammation, diabetes, and decreased GFR are associated significantly with the presence of aortic calcification in predialysis CKD patients. Decreased eGFR was associated significantly and independently with advancement of the quantitative degree of aortic calcification.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is an important component of chronic kidney disease - mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) associated to adverse hard outcomes, such as mortality. The aims of this study were to assess (i) the prevalence of VC in a cohort of hemodialysis (HD) patients and (ii) the risk factors associated to this condition. Methods: In this cohort study, 81 HD (age: 57.2 ± 13.8 years; 61% males; 50% of diabetics; length on HD: 18 ± 8 months) patients were submitted to simple X-rays of hands and hips to evaluate VC (Adragao score) and to laboratorial measurements (calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25-OH-vitamin D, intact-PTH, albumin and lipid profile). Results: VC was present in 45% of the patients. Patients with VC were older (62±10 vs 53±19 yrs; p=0.002), most of them were diabetics (64%; p=0.01) and had significantly higher levels of calcium (9.2±0.9 vs 8.7±0.6 mg/dL; p=0.005) when compared to patients without VC. Notably, in patients with calcium levels above the median (8.9 mg/dL), a value below the upper limit of the reference range (8.4 - 10.2 mg/dL) there was a significantly higher prevalence of VC (58%; p=0.04). Calcification score was directly associated with age (r=0.27;p=0.01) and calcium levels (r=0.27;p=0.01) and inversely associated with iPTH (r=-0.22;p=0.04), total cholesterol (r=-0.22;p=0.04) and albumin (r=-0.21;p=0.05) levels. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that VC was independently associated with calcium (β coefficient= 2.36; p=0.03; 95% confidence interval= 0.393 - 4.771) and diabetes status (β coefficient=3.06; p=0.05; 95% confidence interval= 0.566 - 3.903). Conclusions: VC was highly prevalent in this population. In conjunction with traditional risk factors, such as age and diabetes status, and mineral metabolism derangement, inflammation and altered lipid metabolism may also play a part on VC development. The independent association between VC and calcium reinforces the concept that therapeutic strategies to control CKD-MBD should avoid calcium overload and suggests that calcium levels should be kept below the upper limit of the reference range.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vertebral Fractures (VFs) are common in the general population and in Chronic Kidney Disease patients. VFs are associated with vascular calcifications (VCs) and to an increased risk of mortality. The Spine Deformity Index (SDI) is a summary measure of the VFs status, incorporating both the number and severity of VFs in a score. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between the classic SDI, laboratory parameters of bone metabolism, and vascular calcifications within the context of the EVERFRACT study. Methods: In 387 hemodialysis patients, aged 64.2 ± 14.1 years, we determined routine biochemical parameters and: 25(OH)vitamin D, total Bone Gla Protein (BGP), undercarboxylated BGP (ucBGP) and total Matrix Gla Protein (MGP).We performed laterolateral x-Rays of the spine (T5 to L4) to evaluate both VFs (defined as reduction > 20% in vertebral body height) by Quantitative Vertebral Morphometry and VCs, aortic (AoVC) and iliac (IaVC), byWitteman's method.We divided the SDI score by the number of fractures, in order to obtain a more precise index of fracture severity (corrected-SDI: c-SDI). Results:We found a high prevalence (55.3%, n=214) of VFs. The mean SDI was 1.4 ± 1.74. The mean c-SDI was 0.74 ± 0.75. VFs had a grade of severity that was low through T5-T10 and higher through T11-L3. The severity of fractures was highlighted only by c-SDI (see Table).We found 80.6% of AAoC and 55.6% of IAC. SDI was significantly associated with AAoC (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.30, p=0.023). A SDI >1 was significantly associated with: sex (male OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.20-2.91, p=0.007), age (OR 1.03, 95% 1.01-1.05, p=0.0003) and albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31-0.93, p=0.026). c-SDI score was significantly associated with AAoC (OR=1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.98, p=0.0009) and with IAC (OR=1.54, 95% CI 1.06-2.24, p=0.025). A c-SDI >1 was significantly associated with: age (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.07, p<0.0001), LDL Cholesterol ≥ 90 mg/dL (OR 1.74, 95% 1.04-2.92, p=0.0354) and ucBGP ≥ 17.2 mcg/L (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18-0.70, p=0.0025). Conclusions: SDI and c-SDI score associated with bone and vascular markers. c-SDI score performed better in the evaluation of the grade of fracture severity and it showed a stronger association with VC and vascular markers. This is the first time that the association of SDI with bone biochemical parameters and VC has been reported. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is an important physiological regulator of osteoclastogenesis and marker of atherosclerosis. Increased serum OPG levels were reported in patients with chronic kidney disease and severe vascular calcifications, which are a well-known factor participating in the development of left ventricle hypertrophy (LVH). This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate whether OPG is a marker of LVH in stable kidney transplant recipients. Methods: Echocardiography, carotid ultrasound (intima media thickness - IMT) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were performed in 112 kidney transplant recipients with a mean time after transplant of 8.0±1.8 years. OPG, parathormone (PTH), inflammatory markers, adhesion molecules and N-terminal prohormone of the brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations were measured. LVH was diagnosed in patients with left ventricle mass index (LVMI) >110 g/m2 for women and >134 g/m2 for men. Results: In 64 patients (57%) LVH was diagnosed. Patients with LVH were older by 4 years, had 8 months longer dialysis vintage, greater IMT, higher serum PTH, OPG, CRP, and NT-proBNP concentrations, but lower eGFR. Serum OPG level was significantly related to LVMI (r=0.280, p=0.005) and NT-proBNP (r=0.226, p=0.02), but not to eGFR. Additionaly, serum NT-proBNP concentration was proportional to LVMI (r=0.416, p<0.001) and inversely related to eGFR (r=-0.251, p=0.01). In backward stepwise multivariate regression analysis, the LVMI variability was independently explained by NT-proBNP (β=0.358), OPG (β=0.203) and eGFR (β=-0.104). Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis showed that OPG concentration over 4.8 pmol/l is more sensitive marker of LVH than NT-proBNP concentration over 429 pg/ml (78.1% vs. 62.5%), however with lower specificity (47.9% vs. 66.7%). Conclusions: OPG is a potential, more sensitive than NT-proBNP, marker of LVH in stable kidney transplant recipients, however its usefulness in clinical practice is restricted by its low specificity.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Pyrophosphate (PPi), an endogenous molecule that inhibits hydroxyapatite crystal formation, has been shown to prevent the development of VC in animal models of CKD. However, the possibility of harmful effects of exogenous administration of PPi on bone requires further investigation. To this end, we examined by histomorphometry the bone of CKD mice after intraperitoneal PPi administration. Methods: After CKD creation or sham surgery, 10-week-old female apolipoprotein-E knockout (apoE-/-)mice were randomized to one non-CKD group or 4 CKD groups (n = 10-35/group) treated with placebo or three distinct doses of PPi, and fed with standard diet. Eight weeks later, the animals were killed. Serum and femurs were sampled. Femurs were processed for bone histomorphometry. Results: Placebo-treated CKD mice had significantly higher values of osteoid volume, osteoid surface and bone formation rate than sham-placebo mice with normal renal function. Slightly higher osteoid values were observed in CKD mice in response to very low PPi dose (OV/BV, O.Th and ObS/BS) and, for one parameter measured, to high PPi dose (O.Th), compared to placebo-treated CKD mice. Treatment with PPi did not modify any other structural parameters. Mineral apposition rates, other parameters of bone formation and resorption were not significantly different among the treated animal groups or control group. Conclusions: In conclusion, PPi does not appear to be deleterious to bone tissue in apoE-/- mice with CKD, although a possible stimulatory PPi effect on osteoid formation may be worth further investigation.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The altered bone and mineral metabolism in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) contributes to vascular calcification (VC). Recent prospective studies report on an inverse relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and VC in CKD patients. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bone specific ALP (BALP) are predictors of increased mortality in patients with CKD. BALP has shown higher sensitivity and specificity than total ALP in reflecting histological alterations in bone. However, associations between ALP, BALP and BMD in previous studies are inconsistent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relation of total ALP and BALP with measurements of total BMD in CKD patients during 24 months. Methods: This observational prospective study followed 194 patients with CKD stage 5 (median age 57 years, 66% male, 32% diabetes mellitus, mean BMI 24.8 kg/m2) during their first 24 months on dialysis treatment. Serum total ALP and BALP (by routine and ELISA-techniques, respectively) and total BMD (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were measured at dialysis start and after 12 and 24 months. Results: At baseline, patients had mean total ALP of 75.7 ± 33.5 U/L, BALP 15.6 ± 9.1 μg/L and BMD 1.14 ± 0.13 g/cm2. Total ALP correlated with total BMD at baseline (rho=-0.20, p=0.005) and at 12 and 24 months after the start of dialysis. A similar correlation was found between BALP and total BMD at baseline (rho=-0.30, p=<0.001) and at 12 and 24 months. During the study period, the serum concentrations of ALP and BALP increased significantly ( p<0.001), whereas BMD values remained stable. Conclusions: These results suggest that ALP and BALP are associated with total BMD in CKD patients. Further studies to elucidate the value of longitudinal assessments of ALP and BALP in CKD patients are warranted.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The presence of albumin in the urine (albuminuria) and the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) are traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. A good predictor of the incidence of CVD is found to be carotid atherosclerosis, which is being evaluated by the Intima-Media-Thickness of the carotid artery wall (cIMT). The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between the cIMT and the stage of CKD based on the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) as well as the presence of diabetic nephropathy graded by the urinary albumin excretion in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: In this study 151 Diabetes Mellitus type 2 patients (79 males and 72 females) with mean age of 68±9 years and 15.5±13 years of diabetes duration were included. Traditional risk factors (Body Mass Index, blood pressure, smoking, serum lipids) as well as more recent (cIMT measurements using B-mode ultrasonography) were assessed and correlated to the stage of CKD and the presence of albuminuria. Associations between cIMT, albuminuria and eGFR and between albuminuria and lipid values were determined by Spearman's nonparametric correlation analysis. Results: The median carotid IMT in stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 was 0.76mm (0.55-1.61), 0.905mm (0.63-1.61), 0.93mm (0.66-1.78), 0.95mm (0.66-1.66) and 0.98mm (0.60-1.60) respectively, and in 35% of the patients the presence of a carotid plaque was revealed. The carotid IMT was significantly elevated as the stage of CKD was progressing (p<0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) and was significantly correlated to the eGFR (r=-258, p=0.002) and the presence of albuminuria (r=301, p=0.004). However, it was not significantly correlated to the glycemic control (assessed by HbA1c). Additionally, hypertriglyceridemia was significantly negatively correlated to the deterioration of eGFR (r=-282, p=0.001) and positively correlated to the presence of albumin in the urine (r=373, p<0.001). Conclusions: Increased levels of urinary albumin excretion and reduced eGFR are associated with atherosclerosis of the carotid artery and elevated serum triglyceride levels in type 2 diabetic patients.This study attenuates the importance of ultrasonography of the carotid Intima-Media Thickness as a way of recognition and prediction of eGFR's deterioration besides a classic indicator of vascular calcification.

N2  - Introduction: Vascular calcification is thought to be associated with a significant mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease. It is well recognized that the prevalence of vascular calcification increases with progressively decreasing kidney function. Although the KDIGO recommended that a lateral abdominal radiograph be used to detect the presence or absence of vascular calcification, the risk factors for progression of calcification are not clearly elucidated. Therefore, we investigate the predictors of vascular calcification progression in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Methods: This study was prospective observational study. Lateral lumbar radiography of the abdominal aorta was used to evaluate the overall abdominal aorta calcification (AAC) score, which is related to the severity of calcific deposits at lumbar vertebral segments L1-L4. Lumbar radiography was performed at baseline and after 1 year, respectively. The progression of AAC score was defined by any increase in Δcalcification (the change of AAC score). Results: The subjects were 124 patients on maintenance hemodialysis. 68 (58.1%) were female. The mean age was 57.2 ± 10.9 years, and the vintage of dialysis was 56.7 ± 53.8 months. The underlying renal diseases were diabetes mellitus in 66 (56.4%) patients. The mean baseline AAC score of the study population was 6.2 ± 6.0. The independent risk factors of AAC were age, presence of cardiovascular diseases, and dialysis vintage. Sixty-five patients (53%) showed AAC progression after 1 year. In a multivariate analysis, the presence of AAC at baseline (p = 0.017) was an independent risk factors for AAC progression in hemodialysis patients. No significant association with AAC progression was found between the baseline and follow up clinical parameters, including gender, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and dialysis vintage. Conclusion: This study identified that the risk factor related with AAC progression in hemodialysis patients was the presence of AAC at baseline. Patients should be carefully evaluated and managed from early stage to prevent development and progression of AAC.

N2  - Introduction: Previous studies have investigated using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to treat damaged kidneys. However, the effect of adipose-derived MSCs (ADMSCs) on vascular calcification in adenine-induced kidney disease is still poorly understood. In the present study, we explored the potential of ADMSCs as an alternative source for the treatment of kidney disease and vascular calcification. Methods: Chronic renal failure was induced in 12-week-old male Sprague- Dawley rats (n = 16) by feeding a diet containing 0.75% adenine for 4 weeks. Time course changes in serum inorganic phosphorus (iP), calcium, and creatinine were measured. Rats were randomized into two groups: control (phosphate buffered saline, n = 9); and ADMSC (intravenous transplantation of 5 × 105 autologous ADMSCs on Days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 following adenine-feeding, n = 7). At the end of the study, vascular calcification was evaluated by Von Kossa-stained sections and calcium and P content in the aorta. Results: Histopathology of the kidney (hematoxylin & eosin) showed a greater dilation of tubular lumens in the control group than the ADMSC group. Creatinine clearance rate in the ADMSC group is higher than the control group (P < 0.05). ADMSC transplantation significantly reduced serum iP compared with control (P < 0.05). Calcium and P content of the aorta in the ADMSC group was lower than the control group (P < 0.05). Von Kossa staining of the thoracic aorta media also revealed that ADMSC transplantation suppressed vascular calcification compared with the control group. Conclusion: This study found that autogenic ADMSC transplantation improved kidney function and suppressed the progression of vascular calcification, suggesting that autogenic transplantation of MSCs is a novel approach for preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease and vascular calcification.

N2  - Introduction: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in patients with CKD, and vascular calcification serves as a key modifier of disease progression. ONO-1301 (ONO) is a novel sustained-release prostacyclin analog possessing thromboxane (TX) synthase inhibitory activity. We recently reported the renoprotective effects of ONO in experimental models of diabetic nephropathy and obstructive uropathy. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacies of ONO on progressive CKD and vascular calcification in a rat model of adenine-induced CKD. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats at 13 weeks of age were fed with the diet containing either 0.75% (CKD) or 0% (control) adenine along with 2.5% protein. After 3 weeks, serum creatinine levels were measured and animals were divided into one of two treatment groups with equivalent kidney dysfunction. For the following 5 weeks, animals were fed with standard rat chow, and ONO (6 mg/kg/day) or vehicle buffer was orally administered. Urine, serum, kidneys and thoracic aorta were obtained and subjected to evaluation. Results: Treatment with ONO did not significantly improve adenine-induced renal functional deterioration (BUN and S-Cr) and renal histological alterations. However, vascular calcification (von Kossa staining), the Ca and Pi content of the thoracic aorta and serum osteocalcin levels were significantly decreased by treatment with ONO compared with the control CKD animals. Treatment with ONO significantly recovered the levels of matrix Gla Protein and Fetuin-A suppressed by adenine-induced CKD, and suppressed the overexpression of RUNX2 in the VSMC of the thoracic aorta (immunohistochemistry). In addition, DHE expression, a marker of oxidative stress, was highly expressed in the VSMC of the thoracic aorta by adenine-induced CKD, and was significantly reduced by treatment with ONO. Conclusion: Taken together, these results suggest the protective role of ONO on vascular calcification via regulating the factors involved in calcification and oxidative stress in the experimental CKD model.

N2  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with arterial medial calcification which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in this population. Several factors are known to promote soft tissue and accelerated arterial calcification in CKD including systemic inflammation, altered calcium and phosphate homeostasis, hypertension, and deficiency of endogenous calcification inhibitors. The ABCC6 transporter (ATP-binding cassette subfamily C number 6), also known as multidrug resistance-associated protein 6 (MRP6), is highly expressed in the liver and kidney. Mutation of ABCC6 results in pseudoxanthoma elasticum, an inherited disorder characterized by arterial and soft tissue calcification. Given the prevalence of arterial medial calcification in CKD, the present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that CKD may lead to acquired ABCC6 deficiency. Methods: CKD was induced via 5/6 nephrectomy in male Sprague-Dawley rats and by adenine-containing diet to cause chronic interstitial nephropathy in female DBA/2J mice. Sham-operated rats and mice fed regular diet served as controls. Liver and kidney tissues were harvested and processed for ABCC6 protein and mRNA analysis. Results: ABCC6 protein levels were significantly reduced in the liver and kidney tissues from CKD rats and mice. However, ABCC6 mRNA levels were unchanged, pointing to post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms for the observed ABCC6 deficiency. Additionally, plasma levels of the calcification inhibitor fetuin-A were significantly decreased in CKD animals compared to controls. Conclusions: CKD results in acquired ABCC6 transporter deficiency. To our knowledge this abnormality has not been previously reported and may contribute to CKD-associated vascular and soft tissue calcification. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Introduction: Calciphylaxis is a rare but dreadful complication of chronic kidney disease. It is characterized by nodular subcutaneous calcification and painful tissue necrosis which often results in ulceration and secondary infection, leading to a high rate of mortality. Pathogenesis of this disease is not well understood and there are very few, poorly studied treatment options for this disease. Case presentation: We report a case of 60 year old Caucasian female with history of long standing diabetes and chronic kidney disease stage 5 who presented with a very high calcium phosphorous product, markedly elevated intact PTH levels and X-ray changes consistent with diagnosis of calciphylaxis. Patient was initially managed by parathyroidectomy and later on was also treated with intravenous sodium thiosulfate thrice weekly with each hemodialysis session for duration of 10 weeks. Conclusion: Patient had rapid and dramatic relief of her symptoms of pain. Treatment with sodium thiosulfate was well tolerated without any side effects, accompanied by significant symptomatic relief but without any effect on disease progression. So the role of sodium thiosulfate in calciphylaxis is unknown and need further studies.

N2  - Case Report: A 62 year old man with a history of chronic kidney disease stage 5, diabetes mellitus, gout and hypertension, presented to the hospital after running out of solution for his chronic peritoneal dialysis. He had lost his insurance after an extended trip to his home country of Mexico, and thus was hospitalized for peritoneal dialysis. Initial labs were notable for hypercalcemia (12.0mg/dL) and hyperphosphatemia (7.4mg/dL). On review of systems he complained of mild right knee pain. Physical examination revealed firm, fixed, non-tender nodules on the right elbow and bilateral metacarpal joints with tenderness over the right olecranon bursa on flexion and extension. Additional labs were notable for normal parathyroid hormone and vitamin D levels as well as negative parathyroid hormone related peptide levels. Imaging of right knee showed vascular calcification, wrists and right elbow showed findings consistent with periarticular calcinosis as well as chronic olecranon bursitis with marked calcium deposition. On further investigation, the patient endorsed taking high dose calcium acetate presumably to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism. While holding calcium acetate, his calcium levels normalized and his joint pain was stable. Tumoral calcinosis involves the deposition of calcium within periarticular soft tissue or larger joints forming lobular, radiodense masses. It is a rare, benign condition that is usually familial but in some instances can result from metabolic abnormalities including secondary hyperparathyroidism from chronic kidney disease or, as this patient demonstrated, high supplemental calcium intake.

N2  - Increased bone loss has been associated with the development of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease patients and postmenopausal woman. Development of calcifications in the aorta was increased in mouse with osteoporosis induced by ovariectomy (OVX) compared to intact mouse undergoing sham procedures (Sham) while estrogen replacement (OVX/E2) attenuated OVX-mediated aortic calcification. DNA microarray analysis was performed to characterize the alterations of gene expression in aorta from OVX, OVX/E2 and Sham. We found that OVX resulted in decrease in expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene concomitant with up-regulation of expression of genes involved in osteogenic differentiation and inflammation compared with Sham. In addition, the level of CD26 mRNA and protein expression was increased in OVX compared to Sham and OVX/E2. To investigate the effect of eNOS deficiency on aortic calcification, we utilized eNOS-deficient mouse. Indeed, aortic calcification was prevalent and CD26 expression was up-regulated in eNOS-deficient mouse, suggesting the involvement of CD26 in the progression of vascular calcification. The expression of CD26 was increased in vascular smooth muscle cells of eNOS-deficient mouse and nitric oxide (NO) administration reduced the expression of CD26, indicating that NO may regulate CD26 expression. Moreover, NF-κB activity was associated with regulation of CD26 expression. Taken together, these results suggest that osteoporosisSUNDAY-ORAL PRESENTATIONS mediated reduction of eNOS and induction of CD26 expression may contribute to aortic calcification.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD patients have more than a 20-fold higher risk of developing CVD. More than 80% of men and 50% of women with CKD develop vascular calcification, leading to death. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which CKD accelerates cardiovascular disease are still poorly understood. Our previous study showed that FXR activation inhibited vascular calcification in tissue culture and in animal models using ApoE knockout (KO) mice with 5/6 nephrectomy (nx). In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism by which FXR activation attenuated CKD-dependent vascular calcification. We found that CKD increased levels of circulating bile acids such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). FXR agonists (INT-747 and Px20606) significantly reduced hepatic CYP8B1 expression, resulting in the specific reduction of CA metabolites such as deoxycholic acid (DCA). In contrast to FXR activation, FXR deficiency accelerated vascular calcification in both ApoE KO mice and LDLR KO mice with 5/6 nx, and also increased circulating bile acids such as DCA. In addition, DCA but not other major bile acids induced the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP signaling of the ER stress in vascular smooth muscle cells, resulting in vascular calcification. CHOP and ATF4 knockdown attenuated DCA-induced vascular calcification. These results demonstrate that increased DCA contributes to CKD-dependent vascular calcification.

N2  - Vascular Calcification (VC), a severe complication increasing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity in ageing, diabetic and chronic renal failure patients. VC occurs as vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) differentiate into osteoblast- like cells or undergoing apoptosis, resulting in arterial stiffness, elevated pulse pressure (PP) and left ventricular hypertrophy. Yet, molecular mechanisms modulating VSMC differentiation and viability are unclear. Our previous findings demonstrate that T-cell death associated gene 51 (TDAG51, pleckstrin homology-like domain family member) deficiency protects against atherosclerotic lesions. This study provides evidence that TDAG51 contributes to VC by regulating osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2 expression and VSMC survival. To study aortic calcification (AC), male C57Bl/6 wild-type (TDAG51+/+) and TDAG51 deficient (TDAG51-/-) mice were injected subcutaneously with Vitamin D3 (VD3, 50,000 IU/kg) or vehicle (0.9% Saline) for 10 days, an established model of VC. AC was assessed by plasma Pi and Ca2+ levels and aortic valve, thoracic and abdominal aorta segments stained with von Kossa. Osteogenic differentiation and TDAG51 levels were assessed by immunoblot, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. TDAG51-/- mice are protected against osteogenic differentiation in aortic artery. Hallmark features of VC including elastinolysis, collagen deposition and RUNX2 expression were significantly reduced in TDAG51-/- mice compared to control. TDAG51-/- mice maintained PP levels. Microarray analysis revealed ENPP1 (inhibitor of VC) was increased 15-fold in cultured TDAG51-/- aortic smc. The results were verified by qRT-PCR and immunoblots showing elevated ENPP1 expression in TDAG51-/- in presence or absence of VD3 compared to control. Also plasma pyrophosphate remained elevated in TDAG51-/- mice in presence of VD3, indicating increased endogenous ENPP1 activity. ENPP1 transient knockdown in TDAG51-/- vsmc lead to VC, elevated RUNX2, alkaline phosphatase activity and apoptosis. Our data demonstrate TDAG51 is a novel and key promoter of VC by regulating RUNX2 and ENPP1 levels in VC. TDAG51 loss confers protection against VC, apoptosis and PP elevation thereby reducing CV injury risk.

N2  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with vascular calcification and this is the main cause of death in these patients. The adenine rat model develops CKD along with vascular calcification. Sodium thiosulfate (STS) prevents vascular calcification in this model, but mechanism has not been elucidated yet. Our hypothesis is that STS prevents calcification via its anti-oxidative properties. Methods: Male wistar rats (n = 50, 8-weeks old, 5 groups) were fed an adenine (Ad) diet for 4 weeks followed by a phosphate diet for 6 weeks. NaCl (NNaCl and AdNaCl group) or STS (Ad STS group) were injected i.p. 6 times per week for 6 weeks. The antioxidants apocynin (AdAPO group) or taurin (AdTAU group) were added to the drinking water and food, respectively. Kidney function was determined at week 0, 4 and 10. Histology, tissue calcium and TEM ultra-structural analyses were performed after sacrificing the animals at week 10. Results: Renal function declined in all Ad-treated animals. Medial aortic calcification and calcium content were vastly decreased in STS-treated animals when compared to untreate uremic controls, as well as APO- and TAU-treated animals. Like in the aorta, calcium conten in heart and kidney tissue was significantly decreased in the AdSTS group. TEM of aortic tissue showed the abundance of calcium- and phosphate-containing matrix vesicles in AdNaCl, AdAPO and AdTAU groups but not in the AdSTS group. Conclusion: STS prevents vascular calcifications by preventing medial matrix vesicle formation. This finding was not observed in animals treated with the anti-oxidants APO or TAU, but was unique to STS.

N2  - Introduction: Vascular calcification is associated with a huge burden of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from chronic renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism. To further evaluate the heterogeneous effect of phosphorus-rich diet on media calcification in different vascular beds, we used DBA/2 mice that have a natural splice variant in the Abcc6 gene and are prone to develop ectopic calcifications. Materials and methods: Female eight-weeks old DBA/2 mice were either set on a standard chow (n=5) or on a phosphorus-rich diet ad libitum (n=5), respectively. After twelve days, vascular calcification was assessed by histopathological evaluations using Alzarin Red stainings and by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, respectively. Results: Phosphorus-rich diet, but not standard chow induced calcification of the abdominal aorta within twelve days. Stainings with Alzarin Red confirmed that these vascular calcifications in the abdominal aorta were restricted to the Tunica media. Abdominal aortas of DBA/2 mice on phosphorus-rich diet displayed a significantly higher calcium (57.3±16.3 vs. 1.5±0.8 μg/mg dry weight; p=0.00013) and phosphorus content (30.5±5.7 vs. 4.7±0.9 μg/mg dry weight; p=0.00002) when compared to standard chow fed controls. The impact of phosphorus-rich diet on vascular calcification was much more pronounced in the abdominal than in the thoracic aorta (p<0.0005). Interestingly, these vascular calcifications of the abdominal aorta were also associated with a significantly higher accumulation of magnesium within the arterial wall (p<0.00005). Discussion: In summary, our data suggest that thoracic and abdominal aortic segments have different intrinsic propensities to develop media calcification upon phosphorus-rich diet depending on the diverse embryonic origin of their smooth muscle cells. Moreover, the significantly increased amount of magnesium within the vascular wall indicates that this aortic media calcification is not confined to calcium hydroxyapatite precipitation.

N2  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Pathogenic vascular calcification (VC) in CKD, likely resulting from altered phosphate and calcium metabolism, is a critical harbinger of CVD in these patients. A growing body of evidence suggests a protective role for magnesium in attenuating VC. In this study, the objective was to elucidate the stoichiometry of mineral accumulation in the vascular media, particularly with regard to the relative abundance of magnesium, phosphate and calcium, during the various stages of progression of VC in male Sprague Dawley rats (n=40) with adenine-induced CKD (0.25% in diet) for up to 7 weeks. The adenine protocol generated a range of CKD severity (creatinine, 234 to 650 μmol/L, mean 353 ± 91 μmol/L) and we further modified the susceptibility to VC by altering vitamin K status. Specifically, we increased vitamin K intake (K1 @ 100 mg/kg diet) or decreased availability (warfarin, ∼0.1 mg/kg/day) to induce a decreased and increased VC, respectively. Calcium, phosphate, and magnesium contents were analyzed in the thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta and pudendal arteries. Accumulating tissue phosphate (∼2.5 to 1100 nmol/mg) positively correlated with both tissue calcium and magnesium levels (r2=0.99, p<0.0001; r2=0.86, p<0.0001 respectively). However, stoichiometric analysis revealed the relative magnesium abundance decreased markedly with progressing VC (∼20% to <2% Mg when PO4 greater than 30 mmol/mg tissue), indicating a trajectory away from the more soluble magnesium containing crystal, whitlockite. Our research suggests that perturbations in Mg homeostasis can mediate changes in the microenvironment that facilitate the progression of VC. Specifically, a relative decrease of magnesium within the vascular media could reduce the protective capacity and potentiate the calcification process.

N2  - Introduction: Calciphylaxis(CPX) a potentially life-threatening condition seen in chronic kidney disease and some other conditions. The cause of CPX is multifactorial, but its precise mechanisms are unclear. Some patients who are at risk of developing CPX may require warfarin therapy for thromboembolic disease. Case report: A 61 year old female with near ESRD secondary to diabetic nephropathy presented with a 4 weeks of nodulo-papular rash to the arms, trunk and face and a 2 weeks of bilateral painful ulceration in calves. The pain associated with the ulcers was disproportionate to the lesions. Her comorbid conditions included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity and hypercholesterolemia. On examination, there was typical CPX ulceration with surrounding erythema in both calves, and nodulo-papular rash to the arms, shoulder and face. Her creatinine, eGFR, corrected calcium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone were 663 micromol/L, 6 ml/min, 2.41 mmol/L, 2.77 mmol/L and 565 pg/ml respectively. Haemodialysis and phosphate binder were commenced. Doppler ultrasound revealed right below knee deep vein thrombosis, complicated by pulmonary embolism and new onset atrial flutter. The patient received heparin infusion initially and then was commenced on warfarin with a two day cross-over period. On the sixth day of warfarin therapy the patient developed bilateral skin necrosis and extension of the lower limb ulcers. Right leg ulcer biopsy showed microvascular thrombosis with probable early infarction.Warfarin was ceased and enoxaparin commenced with anti-Xa level monitoring. Unfortunately, our patient died of bilateral cerebral infarct whilst awaiting sodium thiosulphate supply for her ulcers. Conclusion: Calciphylaxis and warfarin induced skin necrosis in practice may be difficult to distinguish. Warfarin use may precipitate or exacerbate calciphylaxis and ischaemic stroke by accelerating vascular calcification via inhibition of Matrix GIa protein and Gas-6.

N2  - Vascular calcification and hemodynamical abnormalities lead to reduced arterial elasticity in end stage renal disease. Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) predicts cardiovascular mortality in advance stages of renal failure possibly indicating more advanced vascular calcification. The relation of FGF23 to arterial stiffness in chronic kidney disease is currently under investigations. The aim of our cross sectional study was to assess the potential associations between FGF23 and arterial distensibility. FGF23 (ELISA), pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI) and central pulse pressure (CPP) (PulsePen), were measured in patients with different stages of renal insufficiency (n = 103, 64.8±13.3 years, 50 males, eGFR 40±21 mL/min/1.73m2). Univariate and multiple linear regression models were used for the statistical analysis. According to our results, logFGF23 showed significant relation with serum phosphate, PTH levels and renal function. There were no significant correlations between FGF23 and PWV or CPP. AI, however, correlated negatively with logFGF23 (r= -0.24, p<0.05). By multiple regressions, serum phosphate, logFGF23, systolic blood pressure and heart rate proved to be the individual predictors of AI. (R2 = 0.31, β = 0.31, -0.33, 0.21, -0.27, p<0.05). In the subgroup of patients with <45 mL/min/1.73m2 eGFR, serum phosphate and logFGF23 remained the significant predictors (R2 0.21, β = 0.31, -0.39, p<0.05) FGF23 may be a determinant of peripheral arterial elasticity independently of serum phosphate level especially in advanced stages of chronic kidney disease.

Stainings with Alzarin Red confirmed that these vascular calcifications in the abdominal aorta were restricted to the Tunica media. Abdominal aortas of DBA/2 mice on phosphorus-rich diet displayed a significantly higher calcium (57.3±16.3 vs. 1.5±0.8 µg/mg dry weight; p=0.00013) and phosphorus content (30.5±5.7 vs. 4.7±0.9 µg/mg dry weight; p=0.00002) when compared to standard chow fed controls. The impact of phosphorus-rich diet on vascular calcification was much more pronounced in the abdominal than in the thoracic aorta (p<0.0005). Interestingly, these vascular calcifications of the abdominal aorta were also associated with a significantly higher accumulation of magnesium within the arterial wall (p<0.00005). Discussion: In summary, our data suggest that thoracic and abdominal aortic segments have different intrinsic propensities to develop media calcification upon phosphorus-rich diet depending on the diverse embryonic origin of their smooth muscle cells. Moreover, the significantly increased amount of magnesium within the vascular wall indicates that this aortic media calcification is not confined to calcium hydroxyapatite precipitation.

N2  - Objective: Bone fragility and vascular calcifications are the two main morbidities of mineral and bone disorders associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), resulting from a combination of abnormalities such as impaired growth hormone axis, vitamin D deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, increasedFGF23 levels, hypogonadism, denutrition and drug toxicity. Methods: In a single-centre ancillary study of the longitudinal prospective European 4Cstudy (Cardiovascular Comorbidities in Children with CKD), we evaluated bone and cardiovascular status in 22 teenagers with pre-dialysis CKD. We used the tridimensional noninvasive high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT, SCANCO?), as well as pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM). Statistical analyses were performed with nonparametric tests (SPSS). Results are presented as mean+/-SD in case of parametric distribution or as median (range) for skewed distribution. Results: At a mean±SD age of 14.1±2.7 yrs (bone age 12.8±2.5 yrs, 16 boys), average height and BMI were 152±15 cmand 18.9±2.5 kg/m2 corresponding to SDS of -0.8±1.2 and 0.0±1.0, respectively. Median serum phosphate was 1.41(0.90-2.58) mmol/L for an average GFR of 32±10 mL/min per 1.73m2. PTH and 25OH-vitamin D levels were 107(29-359) pg/mL and 66±18 nmol/L, respectively. Bivariate analyses between bone and cardiovascular findings showed positive associations between trabecular density/thickness and BP (24-hr and daytime ABPM results for systolic, diastolic and mean BP), the Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.46 to 0.65 (p<0.05). Trabecular thickness was also associated with PWV (r= 0.598, p=0.003). In contrast, IMT results were not associated with any bone parameter. Conclusion: These results suggest a significant interplay between trabecular bone and BP in teenagers with pre-dialysis CKD: the greater the trabecular thickness, the greater the PWV and ABPM parameters, and thus the greater the arterial stiffness. One may hypothezise that in pediatric CKD, the use of calcium supplements may be able to improve bone quality while being deleterious for vessels.

N2  - Objective: Vitamin D receptor activators (VDRA's) are used to treat and prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Paricalcitol suppresses PTH and is less hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic than calcitriol. Anti-inflammatory activity, inhibition of the renin angiotensin system, retardation of renal failure progression and reduction of albuminuria are all potential beneficial effects of selective VDRA's in CKD. Information on the use of paricalcitol in children is insufficient. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of paricalcitol and calcitriol on renal damage, vascular calcification and osseous structure in uremic young rats. Three groups (n=5) of weaning female rats. Nx = 5/6 nephrectomy; NxP = Nx + 1 ug oral paricalcitol/48h, 7 doses; NxC = Nx + 0.25 ug oral calcitriol/48h, 7 doses. All animals received high phosphorus (0.9%) diet. Methods: At sacrifice, serum biochemistry and proteinuria were measured. Vascular calcification and osseous structure were analyzed by micro-CT. Results: Both, paricalcitol and calcitriol, reduced PTH levels (mg/dl) significantly and at a similar degree (Nx: 7854+/-2379 vs NxP: 4871+/-3078 and NxC: 3373+/-2095). There were no differences in proteinuria (mg/100g/day) (Nx 254+/-36, NxP 347+/-70, NxC 293+/-65). Paricalcitol and calcitriol treatment were associated with greater extension of aorta calcification (Nx 0.51+/-0.18, NxP 16.50+/-6.67, NxC 10.95+/-6.74 %). In tibiae, bone volume, bone mineral density, as well as other trabecular and cortical histomorphometric features were not significantly different between the two treated groups. Conclusion: In comparison with calcitriol, treatment with oral paricalcitol did not show differences in proteinuria, vascular calcification or bone structure in an experimental model of marked secondary hyperparathyroidism in young uremic rats.

N2  - We report a case of a 41-year-old male with end-stage renal disease receiving chronic hemodialysis who was referred to this hospital because of dyspnea. He had been on a regular dialysis for 20 years due to chronic glomerulonephritis. His transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), and cardiac catheterization confirmed this diagnosis. From clinical examination and review of the chest X-ray and computed tomography images, we thought PH was due to multifactorial mechanisms typical of hemodialysis patients. However, microscopic examination of lung tissue from autopsy specimen revealed extensive calcium deposits not only in alveolar septal wall but also in alveolar capillaries and small vessels, which had diffuse intimal thickening causing the narrowing of the lumens. These pathological findings suggest that pulmonary vascular calcification contributed to the PH in this patient. Learning objective: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is prevalent and associated with mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, the pathogenesis of PH with ESRD remains uncertain. Here we report a PH case receiving long-term hemodialysis, and whose pathological findings revealed extensive calcification in small pulmonary vessels and alveolar capillaries. This case will provide evidence indicating the causative role of pulmonary calcification for the development of PH in dialysis patients. © 2013 Japanese College of Cardiology.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In 2006, Price et al. reported that low protein diet exacerbates VC in adenine-induced uremic rats [Kidney Int. 2006;70(9):1577-83]. The results of this report prompted us to hypothesize that supplementation of certain amino acid would ameliorate VC. Because L-lysine is the first-limiting amino acid in the most of cereal grains, we examined whether L-lysine supplementation ameliorates VC. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats at age 13 weeks were divided randomly into four groups; low protein (LP) diet (group LP), LP diet + 0.75% adenine (group Ade), LP diet + 0.75% adenine + 2.5% glycine (group Gly), or LP diet + 0.75% adenine + 2.5% L-lysine.HCl (group Lys). Glycine served as an amino-acid-control because it is the amino acid that has the simplest structure. Results: At age 18 weeks, rats in group LP had no VC, whereas those in groups Ade and Gly had comparable levels of severe VC. L-lysine supplementation almost completely ameliorated VC. Because VC often coexists with bone loss, we also examined the bone morphology and found that L-lysine protected the femora from osteoporotic changes. Body weight, food intake, water intake, serum levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen, and phosphate were not different among groups Ade, Gly, and Lys. Intriguingly, serum calcium level in group Lys was slightly but significantly higher than those in groups Ade and Gly.We further analyzed plasma levels of amino acids.We confirmed that plasma levels of L-lysine-metabolites, such as alpha-aminoadipic acid and homoarginine, were elevated in group Lys, but the concentrations of plasma lysine were not different among the three adenine-loaded groups. Plasma glycine was also at the comparable level among these groups. Because plasma levels of alanine, proline, arginine, and homoarginine in group Lys were significantly higher than those in groups Ade and Gly, we performed in vitro analysis using these amino acids. In a solution of supersaturated calcium/phosphate, arginine and homoarginine attenuated spontaneous precipitation of minerals, thus suggesting that the elevation of plasma arginine and homoarginine explains the mechanism, at least in part, how VC was attenuated in group Lys. Conclusions: L-lysine ameliorated vascular calcification in adenine-induced uremic rats. Our findings provide a novel approach for the treatment of VC in CKD.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) is common, and is both a marker and a cause of increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, especially so in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Renal transplantation is the cornerstone of the long-term successful management of CKD, and in order to satisfy transplantation needs, more use is made now of living kidney donors (LKD). Prior to selection for transplantation, much clinical screening of potential LKD takes place, including for cardiovascular conditions. It is not known however how much these potentially healthy LKD may be prone to clinically silent VC, and what the implications of VC might be. Methods:We identified 103 living kidney donors from 2011 renal transplant records. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was assessed using existing abdominal CT imaging using multi-channel CT aortograms (used primarily to assess renal vascular anatomy). Using these CT scans, manual calcium scoring was undertaken to calculate total aortic calcium load (AAC severity score). The prevalence, severity and associations of AAC between calcified and non-calcified donors were then compared. Results: 103 donors were identified from records. 93 of these had detailed clinical records to complement their CT scans. 50/93 donors were male, and the mean age was 45.9±1.8 years. Mean MDRD eGFR was 88.73±2.97 ml/min/1.73m2. 7.14±3.07% of the aorta in these donors was calcified with a mean AAC severity score of 0.98±0.56. In kidney donors > 50 years of age there was significantly more AAC than in those < 50 : 2.47±1.56 vs. 0.31±0.29, p<0.001. There was no relationship between the presence or severity of aortic VC and donor GFR, systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, calcium-phosphate product or smoking. Conclusions: AAC prevalence, patterns and severity in this important donor population have not previously been described in the literature. There was relatively little VC in what would be regarded as a “healthy” donor population - present in about a third of patients. VC was more common with age, but the other possible risk factors for the presence or severity of VC did not impact on overall AAC scores. VC did not influence vascular stiffness as represented by pulse pressure. Following the evolution of AAC over time in those who have donated a kidney, and lost some global renal function as a consequence, would be of considerable interest.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: It is still a matter of debate when we should start treatment of disturbed mineral metabolism in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Enhanced vascular calcification has been reported already in CKD stage 4 patients, but an increase of serum phosphate levels is usually observed not before glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreases below 30 ml/min.We studied the association between GFR on the one hand, and serum levels and 24h urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate on the other hand in a large cohort of patients with different CKD stages. Methods: Data on GFR and serum calcium and phosphate levels were available from 26.097 CKD patients; 60.4% were male with a mean age of 69±14 years (range 19-99 years). In addition, 24h urine samples were available in 2.758 patients (59.4% males, mean age 56±14 years [range 15-96 years]). GFR was calculated using the MDRD formula. Biochemical analyses were performed with routine laboratory methods. Results: Mean serum calcium and phosphate concentrations remained within normal range in CKD patients as long as GFR was above 30 ml/min. When GFR decreased below 30 ml/min, mean serum phosphate level increased (p<0.0001) and mean serum calcium level decreased (p<0.0001). Across the spectrum of CKD stages (GFR from 120 to 10-20 ml/min) there was a continuous decrease in 24h urinary calcium excretion from 5.3±3.0 to 1.2±1.0 mmol/24h (p<0.0001) and of phosphate from 27.2±9.5 to 15.4 ±6.8 mmol/24h (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Whereas 24hurinary calcium and phosphate excretions decline already in early CKD stages, serum calcium and phosphate levels remain constant until GFR drops below 30 ml/min. It is unclear whether this gap between urine and blood calcium and phosphate content may contribute to soft tissue calcification in CKD patients, eventually necessitating earlier start of phosphate-binder treatment.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Cardiovascular disease is associated with high mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vascular calcification (VC) is a frequent complication and a strong predictor of mortality in these patients. Hyperphosphatemia is a major pathogenic factor for VC. Recent clinical studies indicate that magnesium (Mg) containing phosphate binders are effective in controlling serum phosphate. A moderate increase in serum Mg concentration has been observed in patients treated with Mg containing phosphate binders. The impact of a moderate increase in serum Mg in VC is not clear. Previous experimental works have shown that high Mg concentration reduces calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro. However, there are no in vivo studies where the effects of high concentrations of Mg were evaluated. The present study was designed to evaluate whether a dietary supplementation of Mg can revert VC in rats with renal failure induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) + calcitriol (CTR) and high phosphorous (P, 1.2%) diet. Methods: VC was generated in male wistar rats through Nx, CTR administration (80 ng/kg) and high P diet (1.2%) for 2 weeks (control group). The effect of dietary Mg on VC was evaluated by dietary supplementation (0.6% Mg). Rats were distributed in the following groups Nx + CTR + P 1.2% and Nx + CTR + P 1.2% + 2 additional weeks of 0.6% Mg diet . Calcium (Ca) and P contents in plasma, aorta, lung and stomach were analyzed. Plasma levels of creatinine, Mg and PTH were also measured. Finally, van Kossa staining was performed in aorta. Results: Aortic Ca levels as well as aortic, stomach and plasmatic levels of P decreased after 2 additional weeks with 0.6% Mg supplementation vs. rats without Mg. These levels were similar or lower than in the control group. Mg and CTR levels increased in rats fed with 0.6% Mg diet while PTH levels decreased significantly with respect to the control group. Van Kossa staining and plasma levels of P were also lower than those of rats fed without Mg diet or control group. Finally, mortality decreased drastically (50%) after 0.6 %Mg supplementation treatment. Conclusions: An increase in dietary of Mg promotes the reversion of vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism. (Table presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Hyperphosphatemia (HyperPO4) and chronic kidney disease- metabolic bone disease (CKD-MBD) is common in end stage renal disease (ESRD). Untreated hyperPO4 can lead to cardiovascular calcification and calciphylaxis. It is a recognised risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in CKD patients. Controlling hyperPO4 is paramount in retarding CKD-MBD & reducing CVD. Several phosphate (PO4) binders are approved to treat hyperPO4. Calcium-based PO4 binder is the most commonly used, however it can cause hypercalcaemia & exacerbate vascular calcification. Sevelamer, calcium-free PO4 binder is frequently associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sevelamer Carbonate (SC) compared to Calcium Carbonate (CaCO) in Asian ESRD patients. Methods: Fifty two (52) Asian ESRD patients were enrolled in this prospective randomized open-labelled crossover trial. After 2 weeks washout, subjects were randomly assigned to either SC or CaCO for 6 weeks. This followed by another 2 weeks washout & a crossover to the other drug for another 6 weeks. The dosage was titrated at week 2 & 4 with target phosphate ≤ 1.78 mmol/L. Results: Mean age was 52 ± 13.81 years; Male:Female= 28:24. Race; Malay: Chinese: Indian= 26(50%): 22(42.3%): 4 (7.7%). Mean RRT duration was 7.96 ± 5.51 years. Mean maximum daily dosage for SC & CaCO were 4.13 g (5.2 tablets) & 2.97 g (6 tablets) respectively. Significant reduction in phosphate was observed at week 2 in both treatment groups (P < 0.02) & remained so at week 6. Phosphate reduced from 2.01 ± 0.65 at baseline to 1.63 ± 0.52 mmol/L at week 6 with SC (P < 0.001), 1.96 ± 0.59 at baseline to 1.42 ± 0.37 mmol/L at week 6 with CaCO (P < 0.001). Calcium increased from 2.15 ± 0.28 to 2.23 ± 0.21 mmol/L during CaCO (P= 0.029), however no significant changes was observed during SC (2.16 to 2.14 mmol/L). Serum albumin increased significantly from 35.47 to 36.63 g/L during SC (P 0.008) but not with CaCO. Calcium-phosphorus product reduced from 3.93 to 3.01 mmol2/L2 (P< 0.001) during SC, 3.63 to 2.75 mmol2/L2(P< 0.001) during CaCO. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) reduced from 332 to 279 pg/ml during SC however increased from 296 to 344 pg/ml during CaCO. These were not significant. Three patients (5.8%) developed mild GI side effect (epigastric pain and bloated) during SC. All were resolved spontaneously and did not required any treatment. Conclusions: Sevelamer Carbonate was well tolerated & effective in controlling hyperphosphatemia as well as reducing calcium-phosphorus product in Asian ESRD patients. Increased in serum albumin could be related to reduce inflammatory markers that was noted in other studies.

N2  - Aim: The mortality in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients is higher than that in normal population. Cardiovascular events are the major contributors in increased mortality rate in CRF patients since more than 50% of deaths are due to cardiovascular events. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) has recently been implicated in the regulation of vascular calcification since it inhibits RANKL-mediated osteoclastic bone resorption. Arterial calcification is a prominent feature of atherosclerosis and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. CRF patients are among high risk patients for the development of atherosclerosis with vascular calcification. In the present study we investigated the level of OPG and it's relation with some cardiac parameters in CRF patients. Methods: A total of 51 CRF patients (21 female, 30 male, mean age: 50.9±16.5 years) and 41 healthy control subjects (22 female, 19 male, mean age: 45.7 ± 11.6 years) were included in the study. Serum levels of OPG (ELISA method), NTProBNP and hsTnT (ECLIA method), CRP (turbidimetric method) and albumin (spectrophotometric method) were measured in all study subjects. Correlations of OPG levels with ejection fraction, CRP and albumin levels and it's relation with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertension (HT) were also investigated. Results: CRF patients had significantly higher serum levels of OPG (105.98 ± 33.76 vs 28.20 ± 3.78 pg/mL, P= 0.045), NTProBNP (5382.00 ± 1115.00 vs 77.00±9.99 pg/mL, P<0.00001), hsTnT (0.070 ± 0.010 vs 0.004 ± 0.001 pg/mL, P <0.00001), CRP (1.13±0.21 vs 0.15±0.08 mg/dL, P <0.00001) and significantly lower serum levels of albumin (3.93±0.08 vs 4.48 ± 0.03 g/dL, P=0.0015) than control subjects. In CRF patients serum OPG levels correlated significantly with CRP (r= 0.506, P <0.0001), albumin (r= -0.332, P=0.016) and ejection fraction (r=-0.657, P <0.0001) values. CRF patients with LVH or HT had significantly (P < 0.05 for both) higher levels of OPG compared to patients without LVH or HT. Conclusion: The findings of higher OPG levels and it's significant relations with some clinical parameters of cardiovascular function suggested that serum OPG level might be a promising parameter in evaluation and follow up of cardiovascular function in CRF patients.

N2  - Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a fibrosing disorder seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients following exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) during imaging procedures. It is extremely rare to see NSF in absence of GBCA exposure (only four cases reported so far). NSF is chronic, often progressive and none of treatment options have shown consistent benefit. Risk factors for developing NSF include exposure to GBCA and presence of renal dysfunction, either acute or chronic. Exposure to GBCA produce pro-fibrotic cytokines causing dermal and visceral fibrosis. Microscopic calcification has been reported in biopsies of rare cases of NSF. Two cases have been described where vascular calcification resembled calciphylaxis. NSF may predispose to or develop in the vicinity of lesions of calciphylaxis. We report a unique presentation of NSF where patient had no prior exposure to GBCA and lesions mimicked calciphylaxis. A 74 yr old female with history of ESRD ( on Hemodialysis for 3 years ), Afib (on Coumadin), DM, presented with bilateral tender ulcerative skin lesions with progressive patchy necrosis over lateral aspect of thigh. Lesions were symmetrical measuring 10X4 inches. Patient's phosphorus and PTH were 6mg/dl and 425 pg/ml respectively. Her Calcium x Phosphorus product was 50. Biopsy of lesions showed dermal fibrosis with interstitial cells demonstrating positivity for CD-34, factor XIII a and CD-68, features consistent with NSF. Patient received local wound care, 5 cycles of plasmapheresis along with sodium thiosulphate for 3months. After 7 months patient has achieved complete closure and recovery of wounds. In the absence of studies validating the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this potentially fatal entity, we propose that NSF be considered in the differential of skin lesions in patients with CKD even in absence of GBCA exposure and that biopsy should preferably include the deep dermis and subcutis, in order to assess for possible vascular calcification.

N2  - Background: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is characterized by vascular calcification, thrombosis, and intense inflammation. Association between statin use and CUA risk has not been investigated. Methods: This matched case control study included 62 adult maintenance hemodialysis patients with biopsy confirmed CUA diagnosed during the years 2002 to 2011 (cases). Controls (n = 124) were hospitalized maintenance hemodialysis patients without CUA (matched by gender and calendar month). Subjects were identified from a research registry. Logistic regression models were applied to compute odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CUA in statin users, and also to examine previously described CUA risk factors. Annual incidence of CUA per 100 hospitalized maintenance hemodialysis patients was calculated. Results: Mean age of cases was 58.3 years. Most were females (68%), and of Caucasian race (64%). Stain use was more common in controls than in cases (39 vs. 19%). Statin use was associated [FIGURE PRESENTED] with lower odds of CUA in unadjusted (0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.79), and adjusted (0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.88) analyses (Figure 1). Hypercalcemia (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.14-4.43), hypoalbuminemia (OR 5.73, 95% CI 2.79-11.77), calcitriol use (OR 5.69, 95% CI 1.02-31.77), and warfarin use (OR 4.30, 95% CI 1.57-11.74) were associated with higher CUA risk in adjusted analyses whereas selective VDAs were not (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.54-3.27). Possible rise in the CUA incidence was noted over the study period (r = 0.84, p = 0.002) (Figure 2). Conclusion: Statin use is associated with reduced CUA risk. Further large prospective data are needed to confirm these findings.

N2  - Vascular calcifications (VC) are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and fracture. Methods typically used to quantify severity of VC are associated with considerable radiation doses, which limits clinical investigation of bone-vascular interactions. High-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT, SCANCO Medical AG) measures true volumetric BMD (vBMD) and trabecular and cortical microarchitecture at the distal radius and tibia with low radiation dosages (3 μSv per scan), and can also detect VC. We hypothesized that peripheral arterial calcifications detected by HR-pQCT would be inversely associated with vBMD and microarchitecture in patients with CKD. We enrolled patients with CKD stages 2+3 (n=18), 4+5 (n=14), hemodialysis (HD, n=16) and an age-, sex- and race- matched reference group with normal kidney function (n=21). Tibia HR-pQCT scans were reviewed for lower leg arterial calcifications (LLAC) and a semi-automated, image-processing algorithm was applied. This included image downscaling, removal of bone volume, and detection of remaining focal hyperdense areas by dual threshold seed-point segmentation. LLAC mass was expressed in mg hydroxyapatite (mgHA). Relationships between LLAC and eGFR, cortical and trabecular vBMD and microarchitecture, PTH, and markers of bone formation (BSAP, osteocalcin, P1NP) and resorption (CTX, TRAP5b) were assessed. Analyses were adjusted for kidney function. Mean age was 65±9 (±SD) years, 57% were male and 45% were Black. Compared to the reference group, LLAC was 3.2 mgHA higher in patients with CKD stages 4+5 and 8.8 mgHA higher in patients on HD (both p<0.05). LLAC was inversely associated with total density (r= -0.30, p<0.05) and trabecular thickness (r= -0.30, p<0.03) at the radius, and with total (r= -0.30, p<0.05) and cortical density (r= -0.30 p<0.05), and cortical thickness (r= -0.20, p<0.05) at the tibia. LLAC was positively associated with BSAP (r= 0.40, p<0.05). In summary, LLAC measured by HR-pQCT was higher in patients with advanced CKD, was inversely associated with vBMD at both radius and tibia, and was directly associated with the bone formation marker, BSAP. These findings suggest that HR-pQCT may prove to be a useful technology to investigate the pathogenesis of associations between the cardiovascular system and the skeleton in CKD and other diseases.

N2  - Background: The relationships between development of vascular calcification and bone micro-architectural disorders, in chronic kidney disease (CKD), are poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the anomalies of bone micro-architecture and mineralisation in uremic rats with vascular calcification as compared to non CKD rats. Methods: CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in male Wistar rats. Vascular calcification was induced by high Ca/P diet and 1.25 (OH)2D (Ca/P/Vit D). Four groups were studied: (1) CTL + standard diet; 2) CTL + Ca/P/Vit D; 3) CKD + standard diet; 4) CKD + Ca/P/Vit D. After 4-6 weeks, the animals were sacrificed for blood biochemistry, bone specimens and thoracic aorta analysis. Von Kossa quantification was used for aorta calcification and left tibiae of each rats were imaged with high resolution Micro-CT for architectural analysis and further bone histomorphometry analysis. Results: Von Kossa analysis showed a significantly higher thoracic aorta calcification in CKD + Ca/P/Vit D as compared to CKD + standard diet and CTL group (Figure 1). Bone micro-architectural analysis by Micro-CT showed a significantly lower cortical BMD in CKD vs CTL and a lower cortical thickness in CKD + Ca/P/Vit D vs CTL due to a decreased outer perimeter. Cortical thickness is also significantly lower in CKD + Ca/P/Vit D vs CKD + standard diet (Figure 2) while trabecular bone volume fraction was higher, although non significantly. The thoracic calcification was inversely correlated to the cortical bone thickness (Figure 3). Conclusions: CKD has a negative effect on bone micro-architecture as shown by decreasing bone cortical thickness and mineral density. Vascular calcification is linked to bone micro-architectural disturbance as bone cortical thickness is even lower in CKD rats with vascular calcification, and that the extent of aortic calcification is negatively correlated to cortical bone thickness of tibiae. This study underlines the interrelationship between vascular calcification and bone micro-architecture in uremic state.

N2  - The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between changes in FGF-23/Klotho levels in serum and diffuse arterial calcification in the patients with different stages of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).Materials and Methods: 70 patients with CKD 1-5D stage were included in the study: 41-with chronic glomerulonephritis, 22-tubulointerstitial nephritis and 7-hypertensive nephrosclerosis (30 men and 40 women, aged 20-65 years, mean age at enrollment was 41 ± 6,7 years). Serum FGF-23 levels (Human FGF-23 ELISA kit using monoclonal antibodies to the full FGF-23 molecule) and Klotho (Human alpha-Kl ELISA using anti-Klotho antibodies) were studied in these patients. The state of blood flow in the heart and large vessels (Doppler ultrasound), pulse wave velocity, calcifications presence (echocardiography) and vascular wall functional ability were studied. Results:In hypertensive CKD patients (n = 49), the degree of increasing Blood Pressure (BP) correlated positively with FGF-23 serum levels (r = 0,452; p <0,01 ) and inversely with Klotho levels (r = - 0,687; p <0,01). In addition, in hypertensive patients (n = 49) was found the feedback between enhanced serum FGF-23 levels, reduced serum Klotho levels with increased left ventricular mass index ( r=0,552; p<0,01 and r = -0,587 ; p <0,01). We also established the strong straight relationship of FGF-23 serum levels [r =0,492;p<0,01] and the reverse relationship of Klotho serum levels [r= -0,537; p<0,01] with the peripheral vascular resistance indices. In these patients increased FGF-23 levels and reduced Klotho levels have been associated with a higher frequency of calcification identification in the heart and large arteries [r=0,625;p<0,01 and r= -0,584;p<0.01].These correlations were strongest in the hypertensive patients who failed to achieve adequate blood pressure correction (n= 27). The patients who was a success to achieve and maintain target blood pressure level (120-130 mm Hg) had higher Klotho levels [r=0,509;p <0,01] and less pronounced degree of myocardial remodeling then those having uncorrected hypertension .This effect was more expressed in the patients who took nephroprotective means - angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for the hypertension correction. Conclusion.It was found the clear link between increased serum FGF-23 and decreased Klotho levels as increasing CKD severity, and diffuse arterial calcification, independent of traditional risk factors.

N2  - Objective: To discuss the management of renal secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) due to recurrent disease in the forearm autograft and neck. Case: A 34 yo man with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis failed medical therapy for SHPT with phosphate binders and vitamin D, and was intolerant to cinacalcet. Preoperative labs were Ca++ 10.4 mg/dL, PO4 4.4 mg/dL, and PTH 1299pg/mL. Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation in the forearm was performed, with a decrease in intraoperative PTH from 1400 to 41pg/mL. Over the next 3 years he developed recurrent disease with Ca++10.8 mg/dL, Ca++-Phos product 58-81, and PTH 3948pg/mL. The forearm graft increased in size to a 4 cm palpable soft mass. Sestamibi scan showed forearm and right (R) lower neck uptake. Residual disease in the R neck was also evident on ultrasound, likely due to inadvertent transection of the R lower gland at the initial operation. Casanova test (R arm occlusion) confirmed hypersecretion of the forearm graft (PTH fell from 4357 to 1129 pg/mL). A staged operation was planned. The forearm graft was excised en bloc, and a new autograft created. Intraoperative PTH decreased from 2500 to 259pg/mL. Cervical exploration is planned for a later date. Discussion: In chronic kidney disease, decreased phosphate clearance, decreased activity of 1-α hydroxylase, andhypocalcemia are inciting factors for SHPT. Recurrent HPT after parathyroidectomy can be treated medically with phosphate binders, vitamin D and calcimimetics. If medical management fails, indications for surgery include persistent hypercalcemia with PTH > 800, elevated Ca++ -PO4 product, bone loss, bone pain, vascular calcification, calciphylaxis and uremic pruritus. Our patient developed recurrent disease in both the forearm graft and neck. Surgery was indicated for hypercalcemia with PTH > 800pg/mL, and an elevated Ca++-PO4product. Conclusion: This case holds many lessons for endocrinologists. A minority of patients with renal SHPT will fail medical therapy and require subtotal parathyroidectomy. Patients are at high risk for recurrence unless the underlying pathology is corrected (i.e. renal transplant). All sites of recurrent disease should be identified before re-operation. Post-operatively, care must be taken to avoid severe hypocalcemia due to hungry bone syndrome. Endocrinologists, nephrologists and endocrine surgeons can work together to offer a multidisciplinary approach in the management of these high risk patients.

N2  - Purpose: Arterial media calcification (AMC) is often the only vascular calcification (VC) present in young patients with chronic renal failure and its presence is associated with higher mortality rates. Currently, X-ray imaging (as a standard approach) is able to show AMC in areas without diffuse overlapping arterial intimal calcification (AIC), but X-ray imaging only allows us to identify this lesion when the vessel is widely calcified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using ultrasonography as opposed to X-rays to visualize AMC in patients with chronic renal failure. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we examined 105 patients (chronic kidney disease stage IV: 19 patients, hemodialysis: 48 patients, renal transplant: 26 patients; mean age: 54 ± 14 years; 65 males and 40 females); B-mode ultrasonography was performed to detect AMC or AIC on the superficial femoral artery (SFA). As a control, plain radiography of the thigh was performed in all patients. Results: Upon ultrasonography investigation, 12 subjects were excluded due to diffuse VC on the SFA that did not permit a distinction between AMC and AIC. In the remaining 93 patients, AMC was detected on the SFA in 43 patients using ultrasonography and in 20 patients using the standard approach. The sensitivity and specificity of the standard approach for the detection of AMC on the SFA were 47 and 100%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the standard approach were 1 and 0.68, respectively. Conclusion: Ultrasonography is able to detect AMC better than the X-ray approach, focusing on individuals at higher risk. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG.

N2  - Background: Chronic inflammation is frequently noted in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. Monocytes are heterogeneous populations of cells, and they can be divided into subtypes with different phenotypes and functions based on CD14 and CD16 positivity. This study examined whether the proinflammatory CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocyte subset expands in predialysis CKD patients, and also whether the expansion of these cells is closely associated with systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: The percentages of proinflammatory CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes were analyzed in 111 predialysis CKD patients using a flow cytometer, and they were compared with brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity as well as the cytokine plasma levels and other clinical parameters. Results: The proportion of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes was significantly higher in patients with advanced stages of CKD than in patients with the early stages. Interleukin-6 levels were also high in patients with advanced stages of CKD. The expansion of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes showed significant positive correlations with the high-sensitive C-reactive protein levels, and negative correlations with the levels of serum albumin, hemoglobin, and 25(OH)-vitamin D. In addition, the expansion of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes was an independent factor correlated with brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity in diabetic CKD patients. Conclusion: Expansion of the proinflammatory CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocyte subset partially accounts for chronic inflammation, malnutrition, and atherosclerosis in CKD. © 2013.

N2  - Background/Aims: Ferric citrate hydrate (JTT-751) is being developed as a treatment for hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease patients, and shows serum phosphorus-reducing effects on hyperphosphatemia in hemodialysis patients. We examined whether JTT-751 could reduce phosphorus absorption in normal rats and prevent the progression of ectopic calcification, secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone abnormalities in chronic renal failure (CRF) rats. Methods: Normal rats were fed a diet containing 0.3, 1 or 3% JTT-751 for 7 days. The effects of JTT-751 on phosphorus absorption were evaluated with fecal and urinary phosphorus excretion. Next, a CRF model simulating hyperphosphatemia was induced by feeding rats a 0.75% adenine diet. After 21 days of starting the adenine diet feeding, 1 or 3% JTT-751 was administered for 35 days by dietary admixture. The serum phosphorus levels and mineral parameters were measured. Calcification in the aorta was examined biochemically and histopathologically. Hyperparathyroidism and bone abnormalities were evaluated by histopathological analysis of the parathyroid and femur, respectively. Results: In normal rats, JTT-751 increased fecal phosphorus excretion and reduced phosphorus absorption and urinary phosphorus excretion. In CRF rats, JTT-751 reduced serum phosphorus levels, the calcium-phosphorus product and calcium content in the aorta. Serum intact parathyroid hormone levels and the incidence and severity of parathyroid hyperplasia were also decreased. JTT-751 reduced femoral bone fibrosis, porosity and osteoid formation. Conclusions: JTT-751 could bind with phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract, increase fecal phosphorus excretion and reduce phosphorus absorption. JTT-751 could prevent the progression of ectopic calcification, secondary hyperparathyroidism and bone abnormalities in rats.

N2  - Introduction: Serum phosphate independently predicts cardiovascular mortality in the general population and in chronic kidney disease (CKD), even when levels are in the normal range. Phosphate has been implicated in the development and progression of vascular calcification and increased arterial stiffness, which is a driver of structural heart disease. We hypothesised that the non-calcium-based phosphate binder sevelamer carbonate would reduce left ventricular (LV) mass, reduce arterial stiffness and improve LV systolic and diastolic function in patients with stage 3 non-diabetic CKD. Methods: This was a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (figure). All patients received sevelamer carbonate for four weeks before randomisation to sevelamer or placebo for a further 36 weeks. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography were used to assess LV mass and systolic and diastolic function. Arterial stiffness was determined by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). Results: A total of 120 patients were recruited. Mean age was 55 ± 14 years with 55% male and mean glomerular filtration rate 50 ± 13ml/min/1.73m2. Mean baseline LV mass, function and volumes were normal. After 40 weeks there were no significant changes in LV mass (-1.0 ± 7.2 vs. -0.2 ± 6.6 grams, P=0.6), LV systolic and diastolic function or PWV between sevelamer and placebo groups (table). Despite regular monitoring only 56% of subjects took 80% of prescribed therapy. Conclusion: In patients with stage 3 non-diabetic CKD, 40 weeks of treatment with sevelamer carbonate did not improve LV mass, LV systolic and diastolic function, or arterial stiffness.

N2  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, and it has been observed that more of deaths in dialysis patients could be attributed to atherosclerotic complications. In this study we determined the most important markers of mineral-bone metabolism in elderly CKD patients in order to detect any metabolism changes that could lead to the vascular calcification frequently observed in these patients. Methods: The analysis was realized in 94 CKD patients (52 males and 42 females) on haemodialysis for >12 months and in 72 controls (32 males and 32 females), with an age range of 55-70 years in both groups. No participants were receiving treatments related to mineral metabolism. Fasting blood samples were obtained in all subjects. In patients, blood was drawn immediately before initiation of hemodialysis. Serum was separated from cells by centrifugation, and stored at -80° C until analysis. Calcium and phosphorus were determined using the analyzers Roche/ Hitachi Modular CAN 679. Intact PTH (iPTH) was measured by using the N-tact PTH, (IRMA, Diasorin), with intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variance (CVs) of <8%. 1,25(OH)2 D3 was measured after extraction by using the 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 125I RIA Kit (Diasorin), with an intra- and inter-assay CVs of 6.8% and 13.5%, respectively. 25(OH)D3 was measured by using LIAISON 25OH Vitamin D TOTAL (Diasorin), with intra- and inter-assay CVs of <3% and <9%, respectively. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) was measured by a specific enzyme immunoassay (Biomedica Medizinprodukte) with intra-and inter-assay CVs of 4% and 8%, respectively. Total soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (sRANKL) was measured with an enzyme immunoassay (Biomedica Medizinprodukte) with intra- and inter-assay CVs of <3% and <9%, respectively. Osteocalcin (OC) was measured with an ELISA kit (Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics), with intra-and inter-assay CVs of <5%. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) was measured by using the Ostase BAP immunoenzymometric assay ((IDS) with intra- and inter-assay CVs of 3.7% and 7.35%, respectively. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP-5b) was measured using a bone TRAP immunoenzymometric assay (IDS), with intra-and inter-assay CVs of 4.7% and 9%, respectively. Statistical analysis Means and standard errors were calculated for each group. After Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit tests, Student's t test was used for comparison among groups. Significance level was set at p<0.05. Results: No differences in sRANKL (1,1±0.2 vs 0,9±0,2 pm/l) TRACP-5b (2,1±03 vs 1,8±0,2 U/l) and Calcium (9,1±0,1 vs 8,9±0,1 mg/dl) were found between CKD patients and controls. CKD patients had significantly higher levels of Phosphorous (5,0±0,07 vs 2,1±0,01 mg/dl), OPG (11,8± 0,2 vs 2,8 ±0,1 pm/l ), BAP (20,1±0,3 vs 9,5±0,1 ug/dl), iPTH (380±1,2 vs 64±0,2 pg/ml) and OC (86 ±0,5 vs 16 ±0,2 ng/ ml) and significantly lower levels of sRANKL/OPG ratio (0,07±0,02 vs 0,32 ±0,01), 25(OH)D3 (14,1±0,8 vs 29±0,9 ng/ml ) and 1,25(OH)2D3 (10,1±0.6,2 vs 41,6±0.8 pg/ ml) compared with controls. Conclusions: Our results indicate that bone formation and resorption parameters are alterered in CKD patients. The elevated OPG levels and the low levels of vitamin D, may lead to vascular calcifications and cardiovascular complications, in these patients.

N2  - Medial vascular calcification (MVC) is a pathological condition common to variety of diseases, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, obesity, generalised arterial calcification of infancy, arterial calcification due to deficiency of CD73, Kawasaki Disease and Keutel Syndrome. While the genetic and physiological causes of MVC differ between these diseases, several of them share the common feature of tissuenonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) upregulation. To investigate whether TNAP expression is sufficient to cause MVC, we developed a conditional knockin mouse model that overexpresses human TNAP under the control of the vascular smooth muscle cell specific Tagln promoter. As early as seven days of age, male mice showed strong alkaline phosphatase activity in the aorta and, by 14 days, distinct aortic calcification was visible by X-ray. Further X-rays and micro-computed tomography at 30 days showed extensive calcification of the aorta and renal, carotid and coronary arteries. Heart weight measurements showed cardiac hypertrophy at 14 days that became progressively worse at 30 days. Survival curves showed that most male mice died between 25 and 60 days of age. Serum alkaline phosphatase activity was approximately five and 22 times normal at days 14 and 30, respectively. No change in serum phosphate was detected at either age, and while serum calcium was normal at 14 days, it was slightly lower than controls at 30 days of age. No difference in serum pyrophosphate levels were detected at either age, implying that it is the local rather than systemic levels of pyrophosphate that are important for inhibition of calcification. Gene expression analysis showed upregulation of classical markers of MVC (Bmp2 and Opn) and osteoblast markers, (Runx2, Alpl, Phospho1, PiT-1, Enpp1, Ank and Col1a1) and a decrease in expression of the smooth muscle marker Tagln. This data indicates that altering the local Pi/PPi balance is sufficient to initiate the transdifferentiation of smooth muscle cells, a hallmark of MVC. The expression levels of a variety of genes related to phosphate and pyrophosphate metabolism and/or transport were also altered. Overall, the data from this mouse model indicate that TNAP overexpression is sufficient to cause calcification and suggest that TNAP may be a critical mediator in a variety of ectopic calcification disorders.

N2  - Introduction: New Vitamin D receptor activators (VDRA's) are used to treat and prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Paricalcitol is effective in PTH suppression with lower hypercalcemic and hyperphosphoremic effect than calcitriol, which is a determinant factor in vascular calcification risk. VDRA's selectivity carries other beneficial properties like anti-inflammatory activity, inhibition of the renin angiotensin system and reduction of progression of CKD. Our aim was to compare the effect of paricalcitol and calcitriol on mineral metabolism and renal function in an experimental model of young rat. Material and methods: Weaning female Sprague Dawley rats, were kept 32 days with high phosphorus diet (0.9 %). Nx (n=8): nephrectomy 5/6; NxP (n=7): nephrectomy 5/6+1 μg oral paricalcitol/48 h, 7 doses; NxC (n=8): subtotal nephrectomy 5/6+0,25 μg oral calcitriol/48 h, 7 doses. Renal function, Ca/P metabolism and renal histology were evaluated. Results: Both paricalcitol and calcitriol reduced PTH levels (mg/dl) with no differences between groups (Nx: 7854.2± 2378.8 vs NxP: 4871.3±3078.0 vs NxC: 3373.0±2094.7). BUN (mg/dl) was lower in paricalcitol group (Nx: 53.6± 10.91 vs. NxP: 42.3±10.92) while calcitriol treated group showed improved renal clearance (ml/min/100 g) (Nx: 18.98±4.51 vs NxC: 27.46±7.93) and decreased serum creatinine (Nx: 1.1±0.26 vs. NxC: 0.8±0.23). There were no differences in proteinuria. CaxP was similar in all groups, but CaU/CrU and CaU/100 g was higher in paricalcitol group (CaU/CrU: Nx: 0.13±0.052; NxP: 0.23±0.069 and NxC: 0.19±0.126) (CaU/100 g weight: Nx: 2.07±0.62, NxP: 3.84±1.08 and NxC:3.14±2.18). An increase in tubular, arterial and interstitial calcification was detected by semiquantitative score (z-score 0-3) in NxP group compared with control group and those with calcitriol (Nx: 1.37, NxP: 1.86, NxC: 0.28). Conclusions: Our study shows that in a group of young rats paricalcitol failed to improve CKD progression and, although it is less hypercalcemic, has a greater hypercalciuric effect than calcitriol, resulting in tubular, arterial and interstitial renal calcification.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is a predictor of cardiovascular disease. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer from severe vascular calcifications (VC). Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a central calcification inhibitor of the arterial wall. Its activity depends on vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamate carboxylation. Recent studies pointed towards poor vitamin K status in CKD. We therefore aimed to investigate whether vitamin K supplementation improves the bioactivity of vitamin K-dependent proteins and alters vascular disease in a murine model of CKD. Methods: Twenty-eight 5/6-nephrectomized male Wistar rats were supplemented with high VK (“CKD/K”) or with low VK (“CKD”), whereas 20 sham-operated rats served as controls (“Con” “Con/K”). All animals were followed longitudinally up to 12 weeks for vital parameters, serum chemistry, creatinine clearance and cardiac function. After 12 weeks tissue calcium content and mRNA expression of calcification regulating proteins was analyzed. Results: After 12 weeks all CKD-rats developed significant renal insufficiency with increased creatinine serum levels and typical functional cardiovascular alterations (hypertension ncreased interventricular septal wall dimensions). Moreover, we detected profound calcification (von Kossa staining) in kidneys of all CKD-rats, while cardiovascular tissues remained predominantly healthy. Nevertheless, we detected significant CKD- and VK-induced alterations in aortic gene regulation, even before calcification became macroscopically evident: CKD itself induced reduction of SM22-alpha mRNA levels (-3.0-fold; p<0.01∗), reduced MGP-expression (-2.2-fold; p=0.114) and a trend towards increased periostin mRNA levels. Controverse effects in the aortic mRNA repertoire could be induced by VK-supplementation in Con/K-rats, mirrored by induction of MGP (11.4- fold; p<0.05∗), a trend to increased levels of SM22-alpha (3.6-fold; p=0.2) and downregulation of periostin (-6-fold; p<0.05∗) compared to controls. As a matter of fact, CKD-induced procalcific mRNA alterations were abolished by VKsupplementation. Conclusions: CKD induces procalcificatory cardiovascular mRNA alterations even before macroscopic calcification arises. We demonstrated for the first time that VK-supplementation rescues CKD-mediated mRNA alterations of VKdependent proteins involved in calcification (MGP) and remodeling (periostin).

N2  - Aim: To examine the prevalence and epidemiology of vascular calcification (VC) assessed by lateral abdominal x-ray in patients undergoing kidney and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplants. Background: VC and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 5-5D. However, most are elderly, with CKD often caused by vascular pathology. Patients undergoing transplantation are younger than other dialysis patients and their CKD is infrequently vascular in origin. The prevalence and epidemiology of VC in these patients has not previously been characterised. Methods: 607 consecutive patients receiving kidney or SPK transplants from 2000-2012 were assessed with laboratory values immediately before transplantation and lateral abdominal x-ray for VC plus bone mineral density (BMD) within 4 weeks. Calcification scores were determined using a validated 24-point scale. Results: The median patient age was 42 years (16-71), 59% were male and diabetes was present in 40%. Median time on dialysis was 18 months (0-402), 67% were undergoing kidney and 33% SPK transplantation. X-rays were available for 475 (78%). The VC score was ≥1 in 228 (48%) with the median score 5 (1-24). By stepwise regression analysis, predictors of VC were age (p < 0.001), time on dialysis (p < 0.004) and serum phosphate (p = 0.001). Smoking was associated with VC only in bivariate analysis. VC was not associated with gender, transplant type, presence of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, serum calcium, PTH, ALP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D or calcitriol. There was no inverse relationship to BMD at the hip, spine, forearm or wrist. Conclusions: Vascular calcification is common in younger, fitter kidney and SPK recipients. Nevertheless, similar to older patients, VC is associated with age, dialysis vintage and phosphate levels.

N2  - Objective High serum phosphorus levels have been associated with mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease. In addition, high phosphorus levels have been shown to induce vascular calcification and endothelial dysfunction. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relation of phosphorus and coronary stenosis in diabetic patients. Methods The study included a retrospective analysis of 1011 stable coronary artery disease patients who were admitted to fuwai hospital from January 2008 to May 2008. The severity of coronary artery stenosis was quantified by Gensini score. Age, sex, previous diabetes and hypertension, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum concentrations of creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, glucose etc. were recorded. we divided subjects into 4 groups on the basis of their serum phosphorusconcentrations (≤3.3, >3.3 to ≤ 3.6, > 3.6 to ≤ 3.9, and > 3.9mg/dL). Data are expressed as mean ± SD or frequency. Baselineclinical characteristics were compared by the chi-square test for categorical variables and the analysis of variance test for continuous variables. The unadjusted association between groups of serum phosphorus and coronary Gensini score was tested with the variance test. All p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. Analyses were done using the statistical software SPSS 17.0. Results We studied 1011 stable coronary artery disease patients, of which DM are 324 cases (32%), and non-DM are 687 cases. Serum phosphorus in DM Group is 3.8 ± 0.6 (mg /dL), while mean serum phosphorus in non-DM group is 3.6 ± 0.5(mg /dL). Higher serum phosphorus was significantly associated with coronary Gensini score (P = 0.02) in diabetes, but not in non-DM patients (P = 0.73). And Women (P = 0.004) and old age (P = 0.021) had significantly higher serum phosphorus concentrations. A linear relationship between serum phosphorus and coronary Gensini score was analyzed by bivariate pearson correlation analysis. And the result showed that a positive correlation between serum phosphorus and coronary Gensini score existed in diabetic patients. Conclutions Higher concentrations of serum phosphorus within the normal range could be associated with more serious stenosis of the coronary artery in diabetic patients. And there is a positive correlation between serum phosphorus and coronary Gensini score in diabetic patients.

N2  - Introduction: Abnormalities of bone metabolism and increased vascular calcification are common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are important causes of morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence over the last decade suggests a molecular link between the dysregulation in bone metabolism and the process of VC, although the mechanistic pathways involved are still incompletely understood. The Wnt signalling pathway may play a role in the bone and vascular disturbances seen in CKD, termed collectively CKD-MBD. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible association between circulating concentrations of the secreted Wnt signalling inhibitors; DKK1 and sclerostin with BMD and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD. Material and method: Seventy-seven patients (48 M, 29 F) aged (mean [SD]) 57 [14] years with CKD stages 3B (n=32) and 4 (n=45) were studied. Sclerostin, DKK1, PTH, 1, 25 (OH)2 vitamin D were analysed. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH) and fore-arm (FARM). Arterial stiffness was determined by contour analysis of digital volume pulse (SI DVP). Discussion: There was a positive correlation between sclerostin and age ( r00.47, p <0.000). Sclerostin was higher in men than women (p=0.013). Following correction for age and gender, there was a negative association between GFR and sclerostin (p=0.002).We observed a positive association between sclerostin and BMD at the LS (p=0.0001), FN (p=0.004), TH (p=0.002). In contrast, DKK1 was negatively associated with BMD at the FN (p=0.038). A negative association was seen between DKK1 and SI DVP (p=0.027). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the Wnt signalling pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of CKDMBD. Further larger, prospective studies are needed to establish the clinical relevance of sclerostin and DKK1 as serological markers in CKD-MBD.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Calcium-based phosphate (P) binders are widely used to control hyperphosphatemia however go along with hypercalcemia and accelerated progression of VC. We compared the effect of 2 doses of the magnesium-based phosphate binder CaMg (2/3 Ca-acetate and 1/3Mg-carbonate, Osvaren) to that of sevelamer carbonate (sevelamer) on the development of vascular calcification (VC) in rats with chronic renal failure (CRF). Methods: 56 male rats were divided in 4 groups: vehicle, 375mg/kg CaMg, 750mg/kg CaMg, 750mg/kg sevelamer. CRF was induced by feeding 0.75% adenine-2.5% protein diet for 4 weeks. After 1 week of CRF, rats were gavaged with P-binders or vehicle (7d/week) until sacrifice at week 6. Results: Renal function was significantly impaired after 4 weeks of adenine treatment and comparable in all groups. Vehicle treated CRF rats developed severe hyperphosphatemia which was well controlled in the groups receiving P-binders particularly those receiving CaMg even at the lowest dose (Cmax serum P: vehicle: 20.3-CaMg375: 11.5-CaMg750: 9.9-sev: 16.3mg/dl). AUC0-6wks of serum calcium did not differ significantly between groups. Serum Mg AUC0-6wks dose-dependently increased in CaMg treated groups (vehicle: 15.0-CaMg375: 20.8-CaMg750: 27.16-sevelamer: 16.0 mg.wk/l). Induction of CRF went along with a significant increase in serum PTH. Treatment with CaMg dose-dependently prevented this increase whilst sevelamer did not. Based on tissue calcium measurements, aortas of CaMg treated rats were significantly less calcified compared to vehicle. Sevelamer had no significant effect on aortic calcifications although a clear reducing trend was seen. In contrast, calcifications in arteria femoralis and arteria carotis were significantly reduced by sevelamer and showed a clear trend for CaMg, indicating a possibly different mechanism of calcification in these arteries. Results were confirmed on Von Kossa stained sections, showing that both CaMg and sevelamer significantly reduced the area% calcification in the aorta. Conclusions: Treatment with the Mg-based phosphate binder CaMg effectively controlled serum P and PTH levels resulting in reduced VC in uremic rats.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcifications, due to traditional and non-traditional risk factors (including mineral metabolism abnormalities), are highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Although lumbar aortic calcification score (ACS) provides a simple and inexpensive method to evaluate vascular disease, little is known about its determinants in pre-dialysis stages of CKD. Thus, we aimed to assess ACS relationships with certain uremia-related factors in adults with or without CKD. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, single-center study on 106 stable patients with non-dialysis CKD (60% male; 62 [51-72] years, 55% over 60 year-old; 49% - stage 3, 35% - stage 4, 16%- stage 5) and 34 age- and gender-matched patients without CKD (47% male; 59 [46-66] years, 50% over 60 year-old) was conducted. Only 4% of CKD subjects were treated with calcium salt and none with vitamin D derivatives. Medical history and blood pressure measurement were obtained. Abdominal aortic calcification score was evaluated according to Kauppila on a plain lateral lumbar X-ray. Automatic waveform analyzer measurements and carotid artery ultrasonography were performed to assess the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), ankle-brachial index (ABI) and carotid intimae-media thickness (IMT). Some nontraditional risk factors (serum calcium - tCa, phosphate - PO4, intact parathyroid hormone - iPTH, 25 hydroxy-vitamin D - 25OHD, C-reactive protein - CRP) and serum albumin (sAlb) were measured. Results: The proportions of patients with diabetes mellitus, obesity, and active smoking were similar (26% in CKD group vs. 18% in controls, p=0.35, 32% vs. 26%, p=0.54, and 13% vs. 18%, p=0.71, respectively). Higher ACS was found in CKD (1 [0-5.8]) vs. non-CKD patients (0 [0-1]), p=0.003, especially in those with stages 4 (4 [1-7]), p<0.001, and 5 (7 [3-11]), p<0.001. Univariate linear regression showed strong positive associations of ACS with CKD duration (rs=0.32, p<0.001), PO4 (r=0.26, p=0.002), iPTH (rs=0.35, p<0.001), and CRP (rs=0.32, p<0.001), while glomerular filtration rate (GFR, rs=-0.50, p<0.001), sAlb (r=-0.18, p=0.04) and gender (r=-0.18, p=0.04) were inversely associated. No relationships with age, 25OHD, IMT, and indices of arterial stiffness (CAVI, ABI) were found. However, in a model of multiple linear regression that accounts for 30% of ACS variation ( p<0.001), only GFR (t ratio=2.55, p=0.01), tCa (t ratio=2.57, p=0.01) and male gender (t ratio=2.15, p=0.04) were independent predictors of the aortic calcification score. Conclusions: Abdominal aortic calcifications are more prevalent in non-dialysis CKD patients as compared to their Control counterparts matched for the main traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In adults with and without CKD, lower GFR and higher serum calcium are determinants of ACS. Thus, the decline of kidney function below 30mL/min/1.73 m2 appears as an independent risk factor for vascular calcifications. Among mineral metabolism parameters, only calcium burden seems involved.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The association between vascular calcifications, cardiovascular risk factors, and impaired bone mineral metabolism (MBD) in Chronic Kidney Disease stage 5(CKD-5) is well known. However, little is known on the prevalence and progression of cardiovascular calcifications in the early and intermediate stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 2-3-4). In this crosssectional study prevalence and degree of aortic vascular calcification (AVC) have been assessed in patients with CKD stage 2-3-4 using the Kauppila index (KI) defined on lateral view of Rx abdomen. Methods: All patients with CKD stage 2-3-4 seen in our outpatient clinic between March and December 2011 were studied. The IK was calculated on a Rx abdomen in lateral view, in all patients ( pts). Other variables recorded were: age, diabetes mellitus, smoking, presence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), serum calcium (Ca, mg/dl), serum phosphorus (P, mg/dl), intact serum parathyroid hormone (PTHi; pg/ml), 25OHVitD3 (ng/ml). Results: 115 patients (76 males), mean age 73.4±9.2 years, were evaluated; 13 (11%) CKD2, 72 (63%) CKD3, 30 (26%) CKD4. Forty five pts (39%) had diabetes (7% in CKD2, 62% in CKD3, 31% in CKD4). 33 pts (29%) had PVD (6% in CKD2, 67% in CKD3, 24% in CKD4). 29 pts (25%) had IHD (7% in CKD2, 59% in CKD3, 34% in CKD4). The average values of serum Ca, P, and PTHi were respectively: 9.4±0.68 mg/dl, 3.5±0.58 mg/dl, 132±94.4 pg/ml with no difference among the three stage of CKD. The median and I and III quartiles of KI were 4.0 (1.0-0.8) in all patients, 2.0 (0.0-5.0) in CKD2, 4.0 (0.0-8.5) in CKD3 and 4.5 (2.0-10.0) in CKD4 (p: NS). Twenty five out of 115 pts (22%) had KI= 0; 4/13 (31%) in CKD2, 19/72 (26%) in CKD3 and 2/30 (7%) in CKD4 (CKD3 vs CKD4 p<0.024). KI correlated significantly with age (p <0.001) and was significantly higher in pts with diabetes: 5,0 (1,0-11,0) vs 3.0 (1.0-7.0)(p=0.041) and marginally not significant in those with PVD 7.0 (2.0-10.0) vs 3.0 (0.2-7.0) (p = 0.053). No statistically significant association were found with IHD, smoke, serum Ca, P, PTHi, and 25OH vitD3. Conclusions: AVC is present since the early stages of chronic kidney disease and shows a significant progression according to CKD stage from CKD2 and CKD3 to CKD4 in spite of not significantly different values in calcium phosphate and PTH.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are extensively used for the chronic treatment of common gastrointestinal disorders. Chronic PPI use is associated with increased risk of fractures. The primary endpoint was the extent of aortic and iliac calcifications, in relation to PPI use. Methods: Multicenter, cross-sectional study in hemodialysis patients, 18 hospital based dialysis centers. We included 387 hemodialysis patients (76.2% on chronic PPI treatment). Vascular (aortic and/or iliac) Calcification (VC) assessments were centralized. Witteman's method (Lancet, 1994) was used for blinded assessments in duplicate. VC were quantified by measuring the length of calcific deposits along the anterior and posterior wall of the aorta (mild 0.1-5 cm, moderate 5.1-10 cm and severe >10 cm). They also evaluated the presence or absence of calcifications of the iliac arteries in the same radiograph (mild 0.1-3 cm, moderate 3.1-5 cm and severe > 5 cm). Any differences were resolved by consensus. Results: Bone markers were: Ca 9.15±0.68 mg/dl, P 4.8± 1.28 mg/dl, median ALP 83 U/L, median PTH 244, median 25(OH)D 28.9 nmol/L, median BGP 175 mcg/L, median ucBGP 10.95 mcg/L, median MGP 19.36 nmol/L, median PCR 1.6 mg/L. Prevalence of VC was 80.6% (mild 20.1%, moderate 30.8%, severe 29.7%) in the aorta and 55,1% in the iliac arteries. We found Arterial calcifications were significantly more common in the PPI group : 57.0% vs. 41.3% (p=0.0086). Also the rates of aortic and iliac calcifications considered separately were higher (+12.2% p=0.0254 and +13.6% p=0.0211, respectively). The proportions of patients suffering from angina and atrial fibrillation were significantly higher in the PPI group (+11.7% p=0.0083 and +8.8% p=0.0306, respectively). Severe aortic calcifications, as well as moderate and severe iliac calcifications, appeared to be significantly related to age, male gender, hypertriglyceridemia, warfarin treatment and also to PPI treatment, the latter with an odd ratio of 2.15-2.66 depending on calcification site. Conclusions: In hemodialysis patients chronic treatment with PPIs is associated with vascular calcification, a known risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality in hemodialysis patients, and for cardiovascular events in non renal elderly subjects. Additional studies are warranted to explore the association among chronic PPI treatment, vascular calcifications and cardiovascular events.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: In addition to bleeding, other risks have been associated with the use of warfarin, including an increased susceptibility to vascular calcifications and fractures caused by a reduction in the levels of vitamin K dependent carboxylated enzymes, matrix Gla-protein (MGP) and bone Gla-protein or osteocalcin (BGP), respectively. Indeed, warfarin acts as a vitamin K antagonist reducing Vitamin K levels. The Aim was to evaluate in hemodialysis patients the prevalence of Vertebral Fractures (VF), Vascular Calcifications (VC) and mortality in relation to warfarin use. Methods: Multicenter, cross-sectional study in patients treated in 18 hospital based dialysis centers. We included 387 hemodialysis patients (11.9% on warfarin treatment). We evaluated VF with a computerized analysis, of scanned latero-lateral vertebral X-rays (T4 to L5). Reduction of >20% of vertebral body height was considered a VF, while reductions between 15% and 20% were considered borderline fractures (BF). VF severity was estimated as mild, moderate or severe (reduction: 20- 25%, 25-40% or >40%, respectively). VC assessments were centralized. Witteman's method (Lancet, 1994) was used for blinded assessments in duplicate. VC were quantified by measuring the length of calcific deposits along the anterior and posterior wall of the aorta (mild 0.1-5 cm, moderate 5.1-10 cm and severe > 10 cm). They also evaluated the presence or absence of calcifications of the iliac arteries in the same radiograph (mild 0.1-3 cm, moderate 3.1-5 cm and severe > 5 cm). Any differences were resolved by consensus. Follow up 2.7±0.5 years. Results: Bone markers were: Ca 9.15±0.68 mg/dl, P 4.8± 1.28 mg/dl, median ALP 83 U/L, median PTH 244, median BGP 175 mcg/L, median ucBGP 10.95 mcg/L, median MGP 19.36 nmol/L, median PCR 1.6 mg/L. We found that 55% of patients had VF and 30.9% of patients had BF. Prevalence of VC was 80.6% (mild 20.1%, moderate 30.8%, severe 29.7%) in the aorta and55,1% in the iliac arteries. VF were significantly associated with warfarin use in males (6.1% vs 14.4%, p=0.044) but not in females. Severe aortic calcifications appeared to be significantly related to age, male gender, hypertriglyceridemia, PPI treatment and also to warfarin treatment, the latter with an odd ratio of 3.04 (95% CI 1.52-6.07, p=0.0016). Also, severe iliac calcifications were significantly related to age, PTH and warfarin, the latter with an odd ratio of 3.30 (95% CI1.59-6.85, p=0.0013). Furthermore, during follow-up (2.7 ±0.5 years) overall mortality was19.9% (on 387 total patients), but significantly increased in warfarin treated patients (37%; Log rank test p=0.0009). Conclusions: Hemodialysis patients treated with warfarin show a higher prevalence VF (in men), VC and increased mortality. Additional studies are warranted to explore the association among warfarin treatment, VF, VC and mortality.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification (VC) and CKD-MBD are common findings in patients with CKD and are major causes of morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence over the last decade suggests a molecular link between the dysregulation in bone metabolism and the process of VC, although the mechanistic pathways involved are not completely understood. Evidence derived mainly from animal models also suggests that the Wnt signalling pathway may be implicated in the pathogenesis of VC. Msx2-expressing cells promote vascular calcification, via the activation of Wnt signals. Canonical Wnts signal via the heterodimeric LDL receptor -related proteins, LRP5 and LRP6 to stimulate osteogenic gene expression via nuclear β- catenin-dependent transcription. We theorised that a common regulatory pathway may involve the soluble Wnt signalling inhibitors, sclerostin and DKK1. The aim of the study was to investigate for the first time the possible link between circulating concentrations of DKK1 and sclerostin with BMD and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD. Methods: Seventy-seven ambulant pre-dialysis patients, free from known bone pathology and with no history of any bone-related therapies (48 M, 29 F) aged (mean [SD]) 57 years with CKD stages 3B and 4 were recruited into this cross-sectional study over 9 months. Serum iPTH was measured by Roche 2010 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). 25- hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) vitamin D) and 1,25 Di-OH Vitamin D by Radioimmunoassay (RIA). Sclerostin and DKK-1 was measured using commercially-available ELISAs. Arterial stiffness (SIDVP) and DEXA-derived bone mineral densities (femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS)) were also measured. Results: In univariate analyses, serum sclerostin correlated positively with age (r = 0.47, p < 0.0001). Sclerostin was significantly higher in men compared to women (M : 50.5[30], F : 34 [15.8] pmol/L, p =0.015). Following correction for age and gender, sclerostin was negatively correlated with eGFR. We found that sclerostin was positively associated with BMD at the FN ( p= 0.004) and LS (p=0.0001). In contrast, DKK1 was inversely associated with BMD at the FN (p=0.038). In univariate analyses of the study population, a significant inverse correlation was observed between SIDVP and DKK-1 (r = - 0.287, p = 0.013). SIDVP correlated significantly with age (r = 0.276, p = 0.017), systolic BP (r = 0.242, p = 0.038), diastolic BP (r = 0.270, p = 0.021) and total cholesterol (r = 0.227, p < 0.05). Following correction for age, gender, e GFR, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, CRP, HDL, DKK1 remained a significant negative predictor of SI DVP (p=0.027). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that sclerostin is positively associated with BMD at the hip and lumbar spine in CKD stage 3B and 4, confirming a similar finding shown recently in haemodialysis patients. In contrast, we observed for the first time a negative association between DKK1 and BMD at the femoral neck. Further, DKK1 was negatively associated with SI DVP . Thus we have shown that the recently-reported positive relationship between circulating sclerostin with age and bone mass is also seen in patients with pre-dialysis CKD (this being reported for the first time). Circulating sclerostin is higher in men and is affected by renal clearance. In contrast, DKK1 was negatively associated with bone mass and arterial stiffness, suggesting an important role for this Wnt inhibitor in CKD-MBD.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: It has recently been found that both estrogens and testosterone may inhibit vascular calcification but the role of sex hormones in the development of cardiovascular complications in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still unclear. The aim of the study was to assess the relations between sex hormones, coronary artery calcification (CAC) and atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women with CKD stage 3-5. Methods: In a cross-sectional study serum estradiol, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA), 25-hydroksyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D3), mineral parameters and lipids were measured in 36 Caucasian, non-dialysed amenorrheic women (mean age 56.8 ± 11.4 yrs), with CKD stage 3-5 (mean eGFR 30.8 ± 17.1 ml/min/m2), without any history of cardiovascular event. CAC were measured with multidetector computed tomography and common carotid artery intima media thickness (CCA-IMT) with ultrasound. Results: The prevalence of CAC (CAC score > 30 Agatson units) was 44.4%. Mean CAC score in women with detectable calcification was 132 ± 99. The women who did not develop vascular calcification had also lower CCA-IMT (0.68 ± 0.14 vs 0.88 ± 0.11 mm, p < 0.01). In women with CAC serum estradiol was significantly higher than in those without CAC (28.5 ± 14.3 vs 17 ± 10.6 pg/mL, p < 0.01). Similarly testosterone level in women with CAC was higher than in those without CAC 5.4 ± 4.2 vs 2.3 ± 1.3 pg/mL, p < 0.006 and the same was observed in case of DHEA-s (125 ± 71.5 vs 69.4 ± 59.6 μg/dL, respectively; p < 0.02). Serum 25-OH-D3 was similar in both groups. There was a correlation between serum level of estradiol and CAC score (R = 0.547, p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our results do not support the inhibitory effects of endogenous sex hormones on vascular calcification in postmenopausal women with advanced chronic kidney disease.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Heart rate (RR interval) variability (HRV) is a noninvasive assessment of autonomic cardiac dysfunction and is a predictor of cardiovascular and arrhythmic death in general population and in dialysis patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and the predictor factors of low HRV in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Methods: We studied 81 CKD patients not on dialysis (74% males; 28% diabetic; 43%, 50% and 7% of the patients were respectively in CKD stages 3, 4 and 5). HRV was evaluated in a 24h Holter monitoring, using SDNN (standard deviation of NN, normal to normal RR intervals). A SDNN <100 ms and <70 ms were the cut-off values for moderately or extremely reduced HRV and were detected, respectively in 42% and 14% of the analyzed patients. Results: In univariate analysis SDNN was directly correlated with eGFR (p<0.001), Hb levels(p=0.003), Ca levels (p=0.005) and was inversely correlated with iPTH (p=0.001), fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP) (p=0.005) and NTproBNP levels (p=0.022). Prevalence of diabetes was higher in patients with SDNN <100 (p=0.030) and <70 ms ( p=0.005). HRV was not associated with age, lipid profile, vascular calcifications or left ventricular mass index. In multivariate analysis, Hb (p=0.008) and Ca levels (p=0.001) were positively correlated and diabetes (p=0.003) and FEP (p=0.033) were negatively associated with SDNN. Diabetes (p=0.007) was a positive predictor and calcium levels (p=0.006) and eGFR (p=0.001) were negative predictors of SDNN <100 ms; Hb (p=0.015) was a negative predictor and diabetes (p=0.028) and 24 h mean heart rate (p=0.013) were positive predictors of SDNN < 70 ms. Conclusions: Low HRV, which is a recognized predictor of cardiovascular death, was present in 42% of these CKD patients not on dialysis. Diabetes and lower eGFR were independent predictors of low HRV. Non-traditional risk factors such as lower Hb levels, lower calcium levels and higher FEP were also independently associated with low HRV. Low HRV is an additional cardiovascular risk factor of CKD patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Translational studies demonstrate that hyperphosphatemia promotes atherosclerotic vascular calcification. However, the association of serum phosphorus (P) with parameters of atherosclerosis (AT) remains controversial in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients Methods: This multicenter observational study included 1279 CKD patients from the Spanish Multicenter Study NEFRONA (54, 33 and 14% at CKD stages III, IV and V, respectively), 60.12 years, 63% males, 28% diabetics. We applied a standardized protocol including carotid- intima media thickness, ankle-brachial index and presence/abscense of carotid plaques to determine the AT score (Coll B et al, NDT 2010). The influence of study variables was evaluated applying uni- and multivariate logistic regression model, and using AT score as the dependent variable Results: Patients were classified in 2 groups: 1) no or mild AT (44%); 2) moderate to severe AT (56%). The presence and severity of AT was significantly associated with older age (HR 1.087 [CI95% 1.073-1.102], p<0.001), male sex (1.361 [1.007-1.841], p=0.045), higher P (1.354 [1.135-1.616], p=0.001), systolic blood pressure (1.010 [1.004-1.016], p=0.002),smoking (2.056 [1.535-2.754], p=0.001), and diabetes (1.554 [1.148-2.102], p=0.004) in the multivariate model. The level of renal failure, serum calcium, PTH, and dislipidemia were not associated with AT score. In subsequent analysis, the risk for moderate to severe AT is multiplied by a factor of 2.8 for patients <63 years with P>3.6 mg/dl (2.761 [1.639-4.649], p<0.001). Conclusions: We verified that high P represent a risk for AT in CKD patients with GFR<60 ml/min. This association is more consistent in younger patients even with P levels within normal range.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Atherosclerosis and vascular calcification are the most frequent causes of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial hypertrophy, restenosis post percutaneous coronary angioplasty, circulatory insufficiency and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of the study was to prove an interrelationship between atherosclerotic changes in the structure of carotid artery walls expressed as common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) and classical cardiovascular risk factors like: age, BMI, total cholesterol, LDL- cholesterol, triglycerides; as well as with selected inflammatory markers in patients with CKD treated by peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods: The study included 67 patients (31 females, 36 males), aged 19-75 years, who were treated by PD for 4-100 months (mean dialysis vintage 30.4 months). We assessed the following circulating parameters: albumin, fibrinogen, lipids, procalcitonin, IL-6, IL-18, hs CRP, TGF- β, hs TNF-a and HGF. CCA-IMT was evaluated by ultrasonography examination. Results: We found association between CCA-IMT and age (R = 0.54; p < 0.0001), as well as with BMI (R = 0.39, p = 0.003). Furthermore, positive correlations were found between IL-6 and CCA- IMT (R = 0.35; p = 0.009) as well as TGF-β and CCA- IMT (R = 0.31; p = 0.023). No statistical correlation was noted between the CCA- IMT and the other proinflammatory cytokines (table 1). In multiple regression model, TGF-β, age and BMI were independently associated with CCA-IMT values, age being the strongest predictor. Conclusions:Increased concentration of TGF-β may be a biomarker of the development of cardiovasculardiseases in PD patients; as well as a prognostic factor for the evaluation of atherosclerosisprogression in this group of patients. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Patients with high cardiovascular risk have relatively high probability of both extreme forms of renal osteopathy (RO) based on bone resorption. The targeted therapy, however, differs substantially. Complex bone histomorphometry in individual forms of RO with the determination of different bone components may faciliate a targeted and safe treatment of MBD-CKD (mineral bone disease in chronic kidney disease). Methods: An open prospective pilot study was aimed at a cohort of 12 patients undergoing chronic diaysis (N = 12, females = 8, males = 4, average age 74 years, average dialysis treatment = 38 months). All the patients had severe progressive vascular calcifications. They underwent trephine biopsy with the acquisition of bone tissue followed by histomorphometric assessment of static parameters- relative volume (V) of the bone structure, relative V of osteoid, V of trabecular bone, fraction of osteoid and bone mineral V, surface of the bone structure covered by osteoid, thickness of the beam as well as osteoid component, and the relative V of trabecular bone to spongy bone. We assessed also the dynamic parameters of RO, based on tetracycline lines (TTC). Laboratory evaluation included serum levels of markers related to bone formation and resorption. We determined the volumes of parathyroid glands (PT) and the Z-score using the densitometry (DEXA). Results: Based on the histomorphometry, we identified the mixed form of RO in eight patients. Six of them had high-turnover form of MBD. The last four patients had ABD (adynamic bione disease). Positive correlations at 0,01 significance level were identified between the volume of the bone beam and procollagen 1 (-0.345) and calcitonin (0.224), and between trabecular bone V and serum level of osteocalcin (0,721). Statistical relationship was also between cross- laps, C-telopeptide of collagen 1 and Z-score based on DEXA (-0.681, respectively -0.747). There was a relationship between TTC lines, bone tissue V (0.705) and bone beam thickness (-0.742) and between osteoid and bone mineral V (0.665) with the length of dialysis treatment. We found also the relationship between the volume of PT and procollagen 1 (0.830). Conclusions: We found out that the thickness of TTC lines best correlates with the extent of bone tissue turnover and is the best parameter discriminating hypersostosis and ABD. We confirmed the relationship between osteoblast activity and the increase of trabecular bone V. In complicated cases and in risk patients, the histomorphometry of the bone maintains its pivotal role for complex evaluation of bone changes in MBD-CKD (recommendation of K/DOQi, ERA/EDTA).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Uremic tumoral calcinosis (UTC) is a rare complication in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and its clinical manifestations are poorly understood. This study aimed to analyze a series of UTC and investigate its clinical manifestations and pathological features. Methods: A series of 8 HD patients (1 male and 7 females; age, 41 - 75 years) with UTC, who visited our hospital between 1999 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical fetures, such as sex, etiology of chronic kidney failure, duration of dialyasis, location and size of UTC, and clinical evolution were analyzed. Pathogenesis of UTC was evaluated on the basis of serum calcium and phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH). Histological examination was performed in all cases. Results: HD duration was 6 years or shorter in 87.5%. The primary disease was chronic glomerulonephritis in 75%. Calcification was observed in about 75% of large joints, such as hips, wrist and shoulders. Mean serum adjusted Ca and P were 10.7 ± 0.6 mg/dl and 7.0 ± 1.1 mg/dl, and the mean Ca x P was 72 ± 11.7 mg2/dl2. Mean serum CRP was 1.46 ± 2.1 mg/dl. Intact-PTH (iPTH) was 247 ± 325 pg/ml, and iPTH higher than 500 pg/ml (high iPTH) was observed in 3 cases suggesting secondary hyperparathyroidism. Low iPTH (iPTH < 100 pg/ml) was seen in 3 cases (2 cases were post-parathyroidectomy, and another was diabetic). All cases with high iPTH showed positive CRP. Clinically, in cases with high PTH, large symptomatic tumors of 5 to 10 cm were seen in the soft tissues near major joints, such as the hip, shoulder, elbow. On the other hands, in cases with low PTH, bilateral small tumors of less than 1 cm were found in the phalangeal joint and Achilles' tendon. Massive vascular calcification was seen in all cases with low PTH, while no vascular calcification was seen in cases with high PTH. In cases with high iPTH, parathyroidectomy with Ca x P control eliminated UTC and CRP became negative. Biopsy revealed only amorphous calcified material were observed in 75%, while the remaining two cases showed ectopic bone tissue with positive CRP and fibrous bone. Of the 5 cases undergoing right iliac bone biopsy, there were 2 high iPTH cases with osteitis and 3 low iPTH cases with adynamic bone. Conclusions: UTC was observed around large joints in cases with short HD duration and high Ca x P with hyperphosphatemia, not necessarily related to hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid hyperfunction may contribute to large tumoral calcinosis. Serum CRP was positive in cases with secondary hyperparathyroidism, which suggested that tumoral calcinosis induced an inflammatory reaction that in turn led to ectopic bone formation. It is conceivable that different onset mechanisms and factors other than Ca x P and iPTH are involved in UTC.

N2  - Introduction and Aims:Vascular calcifications as a manifestation of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders (CKD-MBD) consists a strong predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the coronary artery calcification (CAC) in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing regular hemodialysis (HD) and determine the effect of renal transplant (RT) in the progression of CAC. Methods: The study included 20 patients with ESRD undergoing a regular HD treatment (16 males, 4 females) 54.1 ± 9.5 years old who had just received a RT and 16 more HD patients (11 males, 5 females) of 54.4 ± 13.8 years old as control group. At the time of the study all patients were on HD 4 hours thrice a week for 56 ± 34 months. Initially, for the evaluation of CAC, all patients underwent a baseline multislice spiral coronary computed tomography (MSCT) using the Agatston technique for calcium scoring (CS). Baseline MSCT in the RT group was performed immediately after transplantation. Parathyroid hormone, Ca, P, Ca x P, Mg, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and CRP were measured in all patients. After a mean follow up of 16 ± 4 months, 18 RT patients and 14 HD patients underwent a second MSCT in order to evaluate the progression of CAC. Results: Nearly all patients suffered from severe CAC. The baseline CS which was very high, was positively correlated with age (p < 0,001) and CRP (p = 0.03) but no significant association was found between baseline CS and the measured laboratory values. In HD patients, follow-up CS was significantly increased (p = 0.028), whereas RT group did not show significant change. The rate of CS progression was significantly slower in RT group than in HD group (p = 0.05). Conclusions: The prevalence of CAC in these HD patients was very high and progressed during time and mostly associated with age and CRP. Renal transplantation and recovery of renal function considerably halted CAC progression, probably because of the elimination of uremic burden, a significant factor in CKD-MBD disorder that promotes vascular calcifications.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MDB) is an important complication of dialysis population. However, few studies have evaluated this disorder in the peritoneal dialysis (PD) setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate CKD-MBD profile (laboratorial abnormalities, vascular calcification and renal osteodysthrophy) in PD patients Methods: Twenty-nine patients (15 males; age: 48.3 ± 10 years; time on PD 20 ± 18 months) were submitted to (i) laboratorial evaluation, (ii) plain x-rays of hands and hips to evaluate vascular calcification and (iii) iliac crest bone biopsy. Results: The main biochemical and histomorphometric (TMV parameters) characteristics of the study population were: ionized calcium 4.84 ± 0.35 mg/dl; phosphorus 4.9 ± 1.74 mg/dl; alkaline phosphatase: 108 ± 37.8 U/L; iPTH: 355 (75-2435) pg/ml; sclerostin: 1667.6 ± 1181.3 ng/ml; FGF-23: 494.5 (76-7122) pg/ml; 25(OH)vitamin D 12.4 ± 7.3 ng/ml. TMV Parameters: Turnover: BFR/BS 0.01 (0.001-0.1) μm3/μm2/d; Mineralization: OV/BV 3.32 ± 3.82 %; Mlt: 66.8 (83-1098) days; Volume: BV/TV: 23.1 ± 8.3 %. Vascular calcification was present in 24% of the sample. High and low turnover bone diseases were detected in 48.3% and 51.7% of the patients, respectively. Low turnover bone disease was associated to older age, shorter time on PD, lower PTH levels and vascular calcification. Bone formation rate was negatively correlated to sclerostin levels (r: -0.45; p: 0.01). All patients presented vitamin D deficiency (31 %) or insufficiency (69%) and mineralization defects. The trabecular bone volume was preserved in 70% of the patients. Conclusions: The prevalence of low and high turnover bone disease was similar in this PD population, being the former associated to vascular calcification. Sclerostin might play a part in the development of low turnover bone disease. Trabecular volume seems to be preserved in PD.

N2  - Background: Because bone remodelling and vascular calcification appear closely linked in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients, there is interest in applying therapeutic strategies that infl uence this interaction. Bisphosphonate administration has been reported to decrease the progression of extra osseous calcification and recent reviews suggest Bisphosphonates (BP) are a potential treatment to decrease the progression of vascular calcification in CKD. This would appear to be a therapeutic advantage in the treatment of the complications of CKD. The literature on BP nephrotoxicity is mainly concerned with populations of CKD stage 1 to 3. There is a paucity of data regarding the effects of BP on more advanced CKD (i.e. CKD stage 4, stage 5) BP clearly provide fracture protection for patients with osteoporosis in the general community. The presence of renal disease has been a general exclusion criterion in studies of BP efficacy, but on the basis of calculated levels of glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR), considerable numbers of these patients with CKD 1-3 would have participated in these studies. One pooled analysis of nine clinical trials (8996 post-menopausal women) suggested that when blood levels of calcium, phosphate, PTH, ALP and vitamin D are normal, BP administration in CKD 1 to 3 is safe and results in bone fracture reduction (1). The value and risks of BP treatment in more severe forms of CKD is unknown because there is virtually no data for CKD 4 to 5. Aim/Objective: To examine the effects of Bisphosphonates on renal function across the spectrum of CKD Methods: Data relating to all BP infusions dispensed from the pharmacy department of the Royal Hobart Hospital (RHH) in 2010 was obtained. Patient's Creatinine clearance and GFR prior and post-BP dose was recorded from examination of hospital pathology records and from private pathology services. Patients were allocated to one of six stages of CKD based o pre-BP dose recorded renal function. The mean GFR in each stage pre-dose was calculated and then compared to the mean GFR for the same stage post-dose. The respective means were then compared for statistical significance. Findings and conclusions: BP are known nephrotoxic drugs, yet renal function is not being monitored in at least 15% of patients at RHH. Eleven and a half per cent of BP doses had corresponding >20% decline in renal function. This audit suggests prescribing units need to improve renal function monitoring practices associated with BP administration, and that prescribing doctors should be cautious with the use BP at all levels of renal function.

N2  - Calcium-based phosphate (P) binders are widely used to control hyperphosphatemia to however go along with hypercalcemia and accelerated progression of VC. We compared the effect of 2 doses of the magnesium-based phosphate binder CaMg (2/3 Ca-acetate and 1/3 Mg-carbonate, Osvaren) to that of sevelamer carbonate (sevelamer) on the development of vascular calcification (VC) in rats with chronic renal failure (CRF). 56 male rats were divided in 4 groups: vehicle, 375 mg/kg CaMg, 750 mg/kg CaMg, and 750 mg/kg sevelamer. CRF was induced by feeding 0.75% adenine-2.5% protein diet for 4 weeks. After 1 week of CRF, rats were gavaged with P-binders or vehicle (7 d/ week) until sacrifice at week 6. Renal function was significantly impaired after 4 weeks of adenine treatment and comparable in all groups. Vehicle treated CRF rats developed severe hyperphosphatemia which was well controlled in the groups receiving P-binders particularly those receiving CaMg even at the lowest dose (Cmax serum P: vehicle: 20.3-CaMg375: 11.5-CaMg750: 9.9-sev: 16.3 mg/dl). AUC0-6 wks of serum calcium did not differ significantly between groups. Serum Mg AUC0-6 wks dose-dependently increased in Ca Mg treated groups (vehicle: 15.0-CaMg375: 20.8-CaMg750: 27.16-sevelamer: 16.0 mg.wk/l). Induction of CRF went along with a significant increase in serum PTH. Treatment with Ca Mg dose-dependently prevented this increase whilst sevelamer did not. Based on tissue calcium measurements, aortas of CaMg treated rats were significantly less calcified compared to vehicle. Sevelamer had no significant effect on aortic calcifications although a clear reducing trend was seen. In contrast, calcifications in arteria femoralis and arteria carotis were significantly reduced by sevelamer and showed a clear trend for CaMg, indicating a possibly different mechanism of calcification in these arteries. Results were confirmed on Von Kossa stained sections, showing that both CaMg and sevelamer significantly reduced the area% calcification in the aorta. Treatment with the Mg-based phosphate binder CaMg effectively controlled serum P and PTH levels resulting in reduced VC in uremic rats.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the differentially expressed genes in rat in the process of regression of vascular calcification using the suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH). Methods: 24 SD male rats which aged 6 weeks and specific pathogen free grade were selected and randomly allocated into 3 groups, control group (n=8), calcification group(n=8) and regression group (n=8) respectively. Vascular calcification model (vitamin D3 plus nicotine, VDN) were made from rats in calcification group and regression group, and rats in control group were intragastric administered with normal saline and lavaged with peanut oil. Rats were bred for 8 weeks in calcification group and control group, while rats in regression group were fed for 16 weeks. All rats were killed to measure concentration of calcium in the arterial tissue and examine the pathological lesion changes. Subtractive hybridization among vascular cDNA sequences from calcification group and regression group were established. The cDNA fragments which expressed higher or lower in regression group than in calcification group were isolated. Differentially expressed genes with cDNA fragment were inserted into PMD18-T plasmid vector and transformed competent DH-5α, cDNA libraries of differentially expressed gene between calcification group and regression group were then constructed. Recombinant vectors were analyzed by colony PCR, positive genes were randomly selected for sequencing and analyzed by BLAST. 4 genes were randomly selected for RT-PCR certification combined with semi-quantitative analysis of DNA bands. Results: VDN model of rats were successfully constructed. Concentration of tissue calcium in calcification group (15.34 mg/g ± 2.51 mg/g) was significantly increased compared to that in control group (5.20 mg/g ± 0.75 mg/g).

N2  - Introduction: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Phosphate (P) levels are consistently linked with cardiac calcification, carotid intima-media thickness, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death in CKD patients and have been extended to general populations. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is independently associated with left ventricular hypertrophy and enhanced at early stages of CKD, and has been involved in atheromatosis process. Material & Methods: We analyzed, in cross-sectional study, the role between P levels and carotid atheromatosis in 426 CKD patients stage 2-5 (mean age 68.08 ± 12.5 yr, 31.1% women, 27.7% diabetic status, GFR-MDRD 51.62 ± 23.69 ml/min/1.73 m2). Patients were examined for carotid atheromatosis by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography (USBM) with a 7.5 MHZ linear array probe (LogiQ PRO, GEE, USA). Body composition assessment was performed by whole tetrapolar bioelectrical vectorial impedance analysis (BIVA) (EFG, Akern Firenza, Italy). Biochemical nutrition, inflammation and mineral bone disease markers were analyzed. ABI test was performed on 56 patients (12 non-CA, 44 CA). Results: 113 ( 26.5%) pts did not have CA; 313 (74.4%) had CA and compared with non-CA, were older (68.66±10.1 vs. 54.34±10.5 years, p<0.001), male gender (65% vs. 49%, p<0.05), diabetic (36.1% vs. 17.3%, p<0.001), serum (P 3.35±.55 vs. 3.47±0.57, p<0.001, P excretion index 0.79±34 vs. 0.94±39, p<0.001), ABI test (1.01±0.23 vs. 0.84±0.09, p<0.001). Conclusions: CA is associated with older, lower GFR, diabetic and cellular damage expressed by increased Na-K exchange, lower PA, increased TBW by increasing ECW, increased C reactive protein, and serum P and P excretion index. The latter reflects the role of FGF23, which is increased at early stages CKD, and it is a direct inducer of vascular calcification. Further studies are needed to clarify whether a P excretion index is a marker or a potential mechanism for atherosclerosis in patients with CKD.

N2  - Background: Chronic kidney disease related mineral and bone disease (CKD-MBD) is a worldwide challenge in hemodialysis patients. In Senegal, number of dialysis patients is growing but few data are available about their bone disorders. Objectives: To describe patterns of CKD-MBD in Senegalese dialysis patients. Patients and Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study including patients from three dialysis centres in Senegal. Diagnosis of different types of CKD-MBD relied on clinical, biological and radiological data collected from medical records in dialysis. Results: We included 118 patients and 79 of them presented CKD-BMD (prevalence of was 66.9 %). Mean age of CKD-MBD patients was 47.8 ± 15.7 years (16-81 years) and sex-ratio (Male/Female) was 1.15. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was the most frequent disorder (57 patients) followed by adynamic bone disease (21 patients) and osteomalacia (1 patients). The main clinical manifestations were bone pain (17.5% of cases), pruritus (36.8% of cases) and pathological fractures (2.5% of cases). Bone biopsy was not available. Valvular and peripheral vascular calcification were present in 24.5% and 21.2% of patients respectively. Management of CKD-MBD included optimization of dialysis, calcium bicarbonate, sevelamer, vitamin D analogues and calcimimetics. The NKF/DOQI recommended levels of serum calcium, phosphate and parathormone PTH were not achieved in one third of patients. Six patients presented major cardiovascular events during their dialysis period. Conclusions: CKD-MBD are frequent in Senegalese hemodialysis patients and they are dominated by high turn-over disease. Clinical and biological manifestations are unspecific and accurate diagnoses are often difficult in absence of histomorphometry. Treatment is suboptimal for many patients in a context of limited resources. © 2012 Nephrology and Urology Research Center and Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences.

N2  - Background: Arteriosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are strongly associated with vascular calcification. Hyperphosphatemia is an essential risk factor for increased vascular calcification. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients could serve as an in vivo model for accelerated calcification. This study focuses on the most likely protective effects of magnesium ion (Mg 2+) on phosphate-induced vascular calcification ex vivo/in vitro. Furthermore, plasma Mg2+ concentrations of ESRD and healthy controls were investigated for association with surrogate parameters of vascular calcification in vivo. Methods: Aortic segments of male Wistar-Kyoto rats were incubated and the phosphate concentration of the medium was elevated. The aortic segments were incubated in the absence and presence of MgCl2; tissue calcification was quantified by different methods. Serum Mg2+ concentrations of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 5; ESRD) and patients without CKD (controls) were associated with carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) as surrogate parameter for arteriosclerosis and arterial stiffening. Results: Incubation of aortic segments in the presence of β-glycerophosphate and NaH2PO4 caused an increased tissue Ca2+ deposition compared to control conditions. This increased amount of Ca2+ in the aortic rings was significantly decreased in the presence of Mg2+. In CKD patients, but not in controls, magnesium serum concentration was associated with the IMT of the carotid arteries. In addition, CKD patients with higher magnesium serum concentration had a significantly lower PWV. Discussion and Conclusion: Elevated phosphate concentrations in the culture media induce ex vivo/in vitro medial calcification in intact rat aortic rings in the presence of alkaline phosphatase. Mg2+ ions reduced ex vivo/in vitro vascular calcification despite increased phosphate concentration. This hypothesis is additionally based on the fact that CKD patients with high Mg2 serum levels had significantly lower IMT and PWV values, which may result in a lower risk for cardiovascular events and mortality in these patients. Therefore, Mg2+ supplementation may be an option for treatment and prevention of vascular calcification resulting in a reduction of cardiovascular events in CKD patients. Copyright © 2011 S.

N2  - Vascular calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This calcification starts to develop in the early stages of chronic kidney disease and is present in over 50% of patients at the time of dialysis commencement. The aim of these study is to assess the degree of calcifications that may involve the main arteries (carotid, aorta, coronary) in Egyptian patients with chronic kidney disease and whether there is significant correlation between the age, Parathormone hormone (PTH), serum calcium, serum phosphorus, Ca x Ph product, cholesterol and triglycerides and these calcifications. The study was conducted on 81 individuals classified into three groups: 41 patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease on regular hemodialysis for at least one year (group A), 30 CKD patients in predialysis period (group B) and 10 persons of normal individuals as control group (group C). All patients and control were subjected to full medical history, full clinical examination and laboratory investigations including serum calcium, Ph, (intact Parathormone hormone iPTH, Ca x Ph product, total cholesterol and triglycerides. Also radiological investigations include CT abdomen (computed tomography of the abdomen) to assess the degree of calcification of abdominal aorta, Duplex study on the main common carotid arteries and echocardiography to assess the degree of aortic valve calcification if present were done. The results of abdominal aorta calcification (2.12± 1.44 vs 0.43± 0.63vs 0.10± 0.32) showed a highly statistical significant difference between group A and B& A and C (P< 0.0001) while being significant between B and C (P<0.05), common carotid artery calcification (0.73± 1.00 vs 0.57± 0.73vs 0.20± 0.42) showed a significant difference only between group A and C (p<0.05), while aortic valve calcification (0.46± 0.60vs 0.23± 0.43vs 0) showed a high significant difference between A and C& B and C. In dialysis patients abdominal aorta calcification &common carotid artery calcification and aortic valve calcification showed a significant correlation with iPTH, Cholesterol, Triglycerides (p<0.01). In predialysis patients, common carotid artery calcification &abdominal aorta calcification and aortic valve calcification showed significant correlation with age (p<0.01). This study suggested increased incidence of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease Egyptian patients in comparison to the same age and gender of the healthy individuals and vascular calcification is present in CKD patients even in stages before the start of renal replacement therapy. Vascular calcification in CKD patients is a very complicated multifactorial process which needs further studies. © IDOSI Publications, 2011.

N2  - The development of vascular calcification (VC) significantly increases cardiovascular risk. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) the VC process occurs much more rapidly. Matrix-Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin-K dependent protein that inhibits calcification. Warfarin attenuates the activity of MGP by blocking the recycling of vitamin K. We sought to determine whether warfarin treatment or a diet high in vitamin K could modify VC and its hemodynamic consequences. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a diet containing either 0.25% adenine (CKD) or 0% adenine (control). Animals were given a diet containing either high vitamin K (100mg/kg), low vitamin K (0.2 mg/kg), or warfarin (0.08 mg/kg/day) (n>8/group). After 7 weeks, rats were anesthetized and fluid filled catheters inserted into the carotid and femoral arteries were used to measure pulse pressure (PP), and pulse wave velocity (PWV). Kidney function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine. VC was assessed using the calcium-O-cresophthalein assay. Creatinine levels were significantly elevated in the CKD group (345±117 juM) compared to controls (51 ±10 juM). PP and PWV in CKD + warfarin animals (60±33 mmHg, 1128±877 cm/s) were significantly elevated compared to controls (37±5 mmHg, 533±72, p<0.05) but were not significantly elevated in CKD + low K animals (44±19 mmHg, 611 ±144 cm/s) or CKD + high K animals (36±5.8 mmHg, 549±148 cm/s). Left ventricle/body weight (LV/BW) was significantly elevated in CKD + warfarin animals (2.01 ±0.19 g/kg) and CKD + low K animals (2.18±0.39 g/kg) compared to control (1.84±0.12 g/kg, p<0.05) but was not elevated in CKD + high K animals (1.98±0.12 g/kg). The calcium content was analyzed in the thoracic and abdominal aorta, renal artery and carotid artery. CKD + warfarin animals had significantly more vessels calcified (26β0) compared to CKD + low K (29/85) or control (1/66, Z>4). CKD + high K animals had significantly less vessels calcified (4β1) than CKD + low K (29/85, Z>2)andwas not significantly different than controls (1/66). Taken together, these results indicate that alterations in dietary vitamin K or therapeutic warfarin treatment can modify the development of VC in a rat model of CKD. Further investigation into the mechanism underlying these alterations is required.

N2  - Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and erectile dysfunction (ED) share common risk factors (e.g. aging, hypertension). ED has been shown to precede CVD by an average of 2-5 years, acting as a sentinel of future cardiovascular events. Vascular calcification, which is increased in CKD, further accelerates the CV risk. We examined the impact of CKD on the susceptibility of the pudendal artery, the main resistance vessel regulating penile arterial inflow, to calcification. Methods: Dietary adenine (0.25%, 7 wks) was used to generate CKD in male Sprague-Dawley rats (15 wks). Severity of CKD was assessed by changes in serum creatinine. Pudendal arteries segments were assayed for calcification using the calcium-O-cresolphthalein complexone assay. Von Kossa staining of fixed pudendal arteries was used to visualize and photograph the calcified regions. Erectile responses were assessed using a central acting dopaminergic agonist (apomorphine 80μg/kg, s.c.) to initiate the signal. Results: Creatinine levels (juM) were rank ordered and grouped to establish severity of CKD: no CKD (53.5±12.1), mild-moderate (244.1 ±59.3) and severe CKD (383.1 ±74.0). Calcium (nmol Ca/mg) levels in the pudendal arteries were significantly elevated with increasing levels of creatinine: no CKD (5.0±1.6), mild-moderate (43.3±58.1), severe (108.9± 116.8). Positive Von Kossa staining in the pudendal artery was most evident in animals with severe CKD. Furthermore, the distal portions of the pudendal, closer to the penis, were more calcified than the proximal sections. The calcification was limited to the medial smooth muscle layer and was accompanied by alterations in the smooth muscle phenotype. Erections were significantly decreased (>40%) in animals with both CKD + pudendal calcification. Conclusions: These data provide the first evidence of accelerated pudendal artery calcification in animals with progressively increased severity of CKD. The finding of increased susceptibility of distal portions of the pudendal is novel and warrants further investigation in order to elucidate the mechanism(s) behind this process.

N2  - Background: Metabolic bone changes from chronic kidney disease can have a wide range of presentation. Clinical presentation can be mild or at the extreme end is severe renal osteodystrophy which can present with osteoporosis, osteitis fibrosa cystica, bone resorption, soft tissue and vascular calcification, and the rarely seen uremic leontiasis ossea. This patient illustrates dramatic bony deformities from severe renal osteodystrophy. Case: We report a case of the most severe form of renal osteodystrophy in a 40 year old female with a 7 year history of undertreated ESRD due to glomerulonephritis. At age 38, she experienced occasional gum bleeding with increase in palate size. At 39, the gum bleeding became frequent, her palate expanded gradually, the gaps in-between her teeth became wider, and she started to have difficulty in eating resulting in weight loss. Her height decreased as she developed a pigeon breast due to compression deformity of the spine. Her Intact PTH then was at 4,444 pg/ml, with normal ionized calcium (1.18 meq/L), increased phosphorus (8 mg/dl) and sestamibi scan showed right parathyroid mass. BMD with T scores of -6.4 spine, -5.2 hip, and -6.9 wrist. She was offered parathyroidectomy but refused. She was seen in the endocrine clinic at age 40. At this time, she had lost 20 cms in height, 25 kgs in weight. Her palate has expanded downward almost occupying 3/4 of her oral cavity. Likewise, her maxilla and mandible had expanded forward and downward with looks similar to leontine facies. Her AV fistula was tortuous, severely calcified and enlarged. Her PTH was at 1,508 pg/ml, with normal ionized calcium (1.18 meq/L), more elevated phosphorus ( 8.54 mg/dl), high alkaline phosphatase (2,604 mg/dl) and creatinine(7.9mg/dl), low vitamin D (12.5 mg/dl). Skeletal survey showed skull with granular deossification, lamina dura of the teeth is gone, massive thickening of the facial bone, C5 and C6 with brown tumors, compression deformity with rugger-jersey spine of thoracolumbar, subperiosteal erosions of bilateral humerus, radius, ulna, and phalangeal bones. Extensive calcific deposits in the soft tissue of the left arm and calcified interdigital vessels. MRI showed generalized thickening of the calvarium, upper and lower jaws, with loss of the lamina propria around the roots of the teeth. Neck ultrasound showed 4 parathyroid masses. Parathyroid scintigraphy shower right parathyroid adenoma. A multi disciplinary team of doctors discussed approach of treatment. The general consensus was she is high risk for surgery due to poor nutritional status and high anesthesia risk (Mallampati 4). The decision was to defer surgery, treat her with cinacalcet, paricalcitrol, sevelamer and improve her nutritional status in preparation for surgery. However, intake of medications was erratic due to economic issues. The patient expired from hemorrhage from her palatal mass Conclusion: This case describes a classic severe case of renal osteodystrophy with a marked and progressive growth in the palate and severe bone deformities.

N2  - Vascular calcification (VC) is a strong prognostic marker of mortality due to cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.Plasma inhibitors of calcification such as pyrophosphate (PPi) are important in inhibiting VC. Measurement of PPi in blood can be cumbersome or technically difficult. One of the problems in measuring plasma PPi is its release from platelets. Since platelets are a rich source of PPi, standard methods for measuring plasma PPi require removal of platelets by ultracentrifugation. The purpose of this study was to devise a simple method to prepare platelet-free plasma that can be used for the measurement of in vivo PPi levels in circulation. Approximately 2 - 2.5 ml of the plasma was placed into a pre-cooled Centrisart I tube (13279-E ,Sartorius AG, Germany) and prepared according to manufacturer instructions. The Centrisart I filtration tube contains a polyethersulfone (PES) filter with a 300,000 molecular weight cutoff. The tubes were centrifuged at 2000g for 20 min at 4oC. Absence of platelets was confirmed by fluorescent flowcytometry (Sysmex XE 5000). PPi was measured by an enzymatic assay using uridine-disphosphoglucose (UDPG) pyrophosphate. PPi was measured in plasma from 20 subjects requiring hemodialysis. Subjects were 59 ±7.3 years of age (mean ±SEM) range 48 -75 yrs, 75% male, 70% diabetic, and 90% Hispanic. Platelet free PPi was significantly lower than traditional plasma samples; 1.39 ±0.68 vs 2.74 ±0.27 μM (mean ±SEM), p< 0.01, paired t-test. This data supports the assertion that a significant pool of PPi exists in platelets and presents a practical method of measuring PPi in plasma without platelets.

N2  - Case Presentation: This is a 65-year-old woman with history of Crohn's disease and prolonged surgical hospitalization 14 weeks prior to admission for perforated colon secondary to diverticulitis requiring lower anterior resection with end-ileostomy. Her course was complicated by iatrogenic bladder laceration with repair and pulmonary embolism, for which she received warfarin. She improved and was transferred to a rehabilitation center. She was subsequently readmitted with urosepsis, for which she received antibiotics and heparin anticoagulation bridging back to warfarin. She was again discharged to rehabilitation. Four weeks after warfarin reinitiation she presented with painful skin lesions. Physical exam revealed morbid obesity and exquisitely tender, firm, indurated, violaceous plaques with areas of necrosis extending from the abdominal flanks to the proximal lateral thighs bilaterally. Laboratory analysis was notable for leukocytosis, INR 2.3, serum blood urea nitrogen 145 mg/dL, serum creatinine 3.4 mg/dL (baseline, 0.5 mg/dL), hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and muddy brown urinary casts. Serum PTH was normal, protein S activity was decreased (26%), lupus anticoagulant was positive, and ANA and anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. The differential diagnosis included late-onset warfarin-induced skin necrosis, calciphylaxis, and catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.Warfarin was discontinued, and vitamin K was administered. Skin biopsy showed subcutaneous vascular congestion and thrombosis with focal vascular calcification. Intravenous Sodium thiosulfate was initiated. Triple-phase bone scanning with technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate showed normal vascular flow and blood pool images but delayed radiotracer uptake in the subcutaneous tissues of the thighs, consistent with calciphylaxis. Sodium thiosulfate was continued thrice weekly, and the patient received pamidronate, sevelamer, and opiate pain medication. A low-phosphate diet was initiated. Serum creatinine improved to 0.9 mg/dL with fluid resuscitation. Discussion:Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening condition and may be confused with other disorders causing skin necrosis. It almost always occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease but can occur in acute renal failure and in the absence of kidney disease. Morbidity and mortality are estimated at 50%-80% and are the result of pain, opiate pain medication, and sepsis. Empiric treatment is often necessary. Sodium thiosulfate is a relatively new treatment option for calciphylaxis. Conclusions: The purpose of presenting this case is to increase awareness of this rare condition, which may occur in patients without chronic kidney disease, and to highlight its evaluation and treatment. To our knowledge, this is the third reported case of the use of sodium thiosulfate to treat calciphylaxis in a patient without chronic kidney disease.

N2  - Background: High concentrations of phosphorus, often detected in patients with chronic renal failure, are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, increased risk of sudden death and the presence of extensive vascular calcification. The pathogenic mechanisms responsible for this association are not entirely clear, however they do not seem to be related to traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 60 patients with chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis treatment 3 times a week (mean age 59 years, GFR <30 ml/min, mean dialysis age 9 years, 66% male), divided into 2 groups according to the serum phosphorus level (Group A: phosphorus ¡Ý5 mg/ dl, Group B: <5 mg/dl). Patients underwent physical examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, 24 h Holter ECG monitoring. We analyzed echocardiographic parameters (diameter and thickness of the left ventricle, left ventricular ejection fraction, presence of valvular disease) and electrocardiographic data (heart rate, atrio-ventricular and intraventricular conduction intervals, QTc interval, ventricular premature contractions-VPCs- and ventricular arrhythmias). Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups regarding demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors and previous cardiovascular events. None of the echocardiographic parameters and electrocardiographic data analyzed resulted to be statistically relevant. Only the number of VPCs per patient resulted to be higher in a significant mode (group A: 7.86¡À5,8 VPCs/pt; group B 27¡À18,9 VPCs/pt, p=0.02). Conclusions: The results of our study show no correlation between hyperphosphatemia and cardiovascular events. We did not observe correlation with sustained ventricular arrhythmias or sudden death in this high risk population. Low serum phosphorus level correlates only with a higher frequency of VPCs.

N2  - Purpose of Study: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) predisposes to calcification of the medial layer of arteries but the prevalence and clinical significance are unknown because imaging techniques currently used cannot distinguish it from the neointimal calcification. We have previously shown that breast arterial calcification (BAC) is exclusively medial, correlates with medial calcification in peripheral arteries, and has a 4-fold higher prevalence in dialysis patients. The goal of this study is to use mammography to determine the stage of CKD at which the risk of medial calcification increases, which will be critical in targeting preventive and therapeutic strategies. Methods Used: From a computerized search of women undergoing screening mammography between 2006 and 2009, we identified 102 women with CKD (defined as eGFR <60 ml/min, derived from the four variable MDRD formula), and age- and diabetes-matched controls without CKD. BAC was scored as present or absent based on visual inspection. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare the prevalence of BAC in stage 3 and stage 4 CKD to the matched controls. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the independent effects of age, diabetes, and CKD. Summary of Results: The mean age of patients and control was 69.79 + 1.2 (SEM) and 69.11+ 1.24 respectively. There were 66 patients with CKD III and 36 patients with CKD IV and age did not differ between the groups. The prevalence of BAC in CKD versus controls was 33.3% vs. 26.6% in CKD III (p > 0.1) and 38.8% vs. 21.6% in CKD IV (p = 0.088), yielding relative risks of 1.25 and 1.80. A multivariable logistic model showed p values of <0.0001 for age, 0.11 for CKD, and 0.82 for diabetes. Conclusions: The risk of BAC was increased in both CKD III and CKD IV subjects, and was greater in CKD IV, but it was not statistically significant due to the small samples sizes. The results suggest that the risk of medial vascular calcification may begin early in CKD, which should be confirmed with the ongoing inclusion of additional subjects. However, in light of our previous study showing a 4-fold risk of BAC in ESRD, it appears that medial calcification is often a late occurrence in CKD. Diabetes does not appear to be a risk factor for BAC in this population.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) and arterial stiffness (AS) are major contributors to cardiovascular disease, and a correlation exists between VC and AS in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Disorders of calcium and phosphate metabolism contribute to progression of VC and increases in AS. It is uncertain whether cinacalcet (CIN) reduces arterial stiffness or not in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Methods and Subjects: In the present study, 19 patients (12 females, 7 males; mean age 62.2 ± 3.6 years) on CAPD with serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) > 500 ng/dL were selected (average values; 675±106 ng/ dL). Oral treatment with CIN 25 mg daily was started. If administration of CIN for three months failed to reduce the levels of iPTH to less than 300 ng/dL, the dose of CIN was increased up to 50 mg daily. Before the start of CIN and at three years after the start of CIN, pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined. Results: The levels of iPTH of 11 patients were reduced to less than 300 ng/dL and those of the rest of the patients remained high. There were no significant differences in PWV between the starting values and at three years (1856 ± 98 vs. 1726 ± 87 cm/sec). Multiple regression analysis of the PWV demonstrated that both systolic blood pressure and changes in serum levels of phosphate contributed to decreases in PWV. Conclusions: Vascular stiffness in patients receiving CAPD might be the result of higher systolic blood pressure and the increased serum levels of phosphate.

N2  - Introduction: ED is a sentinel event in cardiovascular disease (CVD), and shares similar etiologies, pathologies, and risk factors. However, the impact of circulatory pathologies such as vascular calcification (VC) on ED are not well studied. Aortic and coronary VC is greatly accelerated in various diseases, but most particularly in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The pudendal artery is a dominant controller of total penile vascular resistance (70%) and yet its susceptibility to calcification has never been studied. In this study we sought to determine the impact of progressing CKD on calcification of pudendal arteries and erections. Methods: Dietary adenine (0.25%, 7 wks) was used to generate CKD in male Sprague Dawley rats (15 wks). Erections were induced by a dopaminergic agonist (apomorphine 80 ug/kg, s.c.) and counted by videomonitoring. Severity of CKD was assessed via serum creatinine. The pudendal artery was excised and assayed for calcification by the calcium-O-cresolphthalein complexone assay. Results: After 7 wks of adenine, results were rank ordered and grouped by severity according to creatinine levels (uM): no CKD (53.5 ± 12.1), mild-moderate (244.1 ± 59.3) and severe CKD (383.1 ± 74.0). Calcification (nmol Ca/mg) in pudendals was significantly elevated with increasing creatinine: 5.0 ± 1.6 (no CKD), 43.3 ± 58.1 (mild-moderate CKD), 108.9 ± 116.8 (severe CKD). Erections were significantly decreased (>40%) in animals with both CKD + pudendal calcification. Conclusion: This is the first evidence that VC of pudendal arteries may play a key role in the onset of ED, particularly in CKD patients.

N2  - Calciphylaxis, or calcific uremic arteriolopathy, commonly affects people with end-stage renal disease and carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Here, we present the unusual case of a 56-year-old woman, with extensive medical problems, who developed calciphylaxis in the presence of primary hyperparathyroidism. Our patient initially presented with bilateral, exquisitely tender thigh lesions. The diagnosis of calciphylaxis was rendered histologically by extensive calcification of the subcutaneous blood vessels. Subsequent parathyroidectomy identified the presence of a hyperactive mediastinal parathyroid adenoma, weighing 0.62 grams. Postoperatively, the patient had normalization of hypercalcemia and parathyroid hormone levels, with subsequent healing of her thigh wounds. Currently, there have been sixteen cases described in the English literature, with only nine being offered a potentially therapeutic parathyroidectomy. It is contingent upon the vigilant physician to diagnose and properly manage this difficult yet treatable condition. © 2010 Jennifer Bishop et al.

N2  - We present the case of a 44-year-old man under replacement therapy with hemodialysis since 1995 and stable hemodynamic and analytical parameters for more than 11 years. Vascular calcifications followed the expected course for this type of patient. In September 2007, after an episode of clinical hyperthyroidism and secondary atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, warfarin treatment was started. Impairment in bone and mineral metabolism disorders in chronic kidney disease (BMM-CKD) biochemical parameters was also observed, with elevated intact parathyroid hormone (PTHi) and phosphorus levels. Despite treatment intensification, these parameters were not adequately controlled for more than 1 year. During this period, vascular calcifications rapidly progressed, with severe consequences to the aortic valve, leading to surgical valvular substitution. Other factors were probably involved in the poor and torpid clinical course of this patient, such as a poor control of BMM-CKD parameters and warfarin treatment. These factors may have been intensified by hemodynamic alterations. © 2010 SEDYT. Published by Elsevier España, S.L. All rights reserved.

N2  - Vascular calcification (VC) significantly increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) accelerates the VC process. There is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the factors which predispose the vasculature to calcification. in the present study we sought to determine, in an adenine model of CKD, whether phosphate, as well as modifying vitamin K dependent proteins (using warfarin and changes in dietary vitamin K) altered the magnitude of VC. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a diet containing either 0.25% adenine (CKD) or 0% adenine (control), both diets containing high phosphate (1%) and low vitamin K(0.2 mg/kg). Animals began the diet at either 9 (young) or 14 (old) weeks of age. After 6-7 weeks on the diet kidney function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine and calcification was assessed using the calcium-O-cresophthalein assay. Creatinine levels were significantly elevated in the CKD group (young, 245.7±43 μmol/L; old, 280±77 μmol/L) compared to controls (67±19 μmol/L). Serum phosphate levels were also elevated in CKD animals (1.5x) and linearly correlated with increases in creatinine (r2=0.73, p<0.0001). Although itwas confirmed that the warfarin treatment altered the regulation of vitamin K dependent proteins (2-fold increase in prothrombin time) it did not alter the severity of CKD (creatinine) or the serum phosphate levels. Despite the similar CKD stimulus the magnitude of the VC was markedly enhanced in the group with further decreases in vitamin K regulation (e.g. warfarin treatment) and VC was only observed in the older group. After 7 weeks of CKD the calcium content of the thoracic aorta (31 ±26 ng/mg tissue) was more than 100 fold higher than in controls (0.22±0.02 ng/mg tissue). Taken together, these results indicate that alterations in the microenvironment of the aorta may be key to predisposing this tissue to a greater risk of vascular calcification.

N2  - CVD and erectile dysfunction (ED) share common risk factors, including aging, hypertension and obesity. The onset of ED is now considered to be a harbinger of impending cardiovascular events. Although the link to ED is not established, the development of vascular calcification (VC) further accelerates cardiovascular risk. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) greatly accelerates the process of VC process. Methods: In the present study we sought to determine the impact of progressing CKD, using dietary adenine (0.25%, with high phosphate 1%), on erectile function in male Sprague Dawley rats. The capacity for erectile responses was assessed using a centrally acting dopaminergic agonist (apomorphine 80ug/kg) at 3 and 7 weeks of CKD. Kidney function was assessed by measuring serum creatinine levels. Vascular calcification was assessed using the calcium-O-cresophthalein assay. Results: Creatinine levels correlated with erectile function, such that an increase in creatinine resulted in a decrease in function. The values were rank ordered and grouped by severity of CKD. Creatinine levels (umol/L) were as follows 67±20 (control), 152±55.7 (mild-moderate), 304±85.4 (severe). Average erectile responses for each group during the half hour bioassay were: 1.9± 1.0 (control), 1.1 ±0.3 (mild-moderate), 0.6±0.5. After CKD was fully developed (@ 7 weeks), more than 90% the animals also had VC, whereas none of the controls did. Conclusions: These results suggest that CKD can accelerate the progression of ED in the aging male rat. Furthermore, this increase in ED is dependent on the severity of CKD. Vascular calcification may play a key role in this rapid onset of ED and further investigation is warranted to examine the mechanistic link.

N2  - Aim: To assess the prevalence of abdominal aortic calcification (ACC) using simple radiological imaging in dialysis patients. Background: Vascular calcification is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. Plain X-rays can detect AAC, although AAC is less well documented in anatomical distribution and severity compared to coronary calcification. This study is an analysis of AAC in prevalent Australian haemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: Lateral lumbar X-ray of the abdominal aorta was used to determine the overall AAC score, which is related to the severity of calcific deposits at lumbar vertebral segments L1 to L4. Semi-quantitative measurement, using a validated 24-point scale, was determined by two radiologists on HD patients from 7 satellite dialysis centres. Results: A lateral lumbar X-ray was obtained in 134 patients. Patients were aged 67 ± 12 years, 67% were male, 36% diabetic with mean duration of HD 54 ± 48 months. Calcification (AAC score ≥ 1) was present in 94.4% of patients. The mean AAC score was 11.0 ± 6.4 (median 12). Independent predictors for the presence and severity of calcification were age (P < 0.0001) and duration of dialysis (P = 0.003). There was no significant association between AAC and time-averaged serum markers of mineral metabolism, lipid status, CRP levels or the presence of diabetes. Vertebral fractures were noted on 7% of X-rays. Conclusions: AAC detected by lateral lumbar X-ray is associated with increasing age and duration of HD. This semi-quantitative method of determining vascular calcification is more widely available and less expensive than current procedures and could form part of cardiovascular risk stratification.

N2  - Introduction: Uremic vasculopathy including vascular calcification increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with vasculopathy in children undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) in a single center. Material and methods: Common carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and its relation with demographics, biochemical parameters and medication was analyzed in 60 patients (age of 12.9±3.4 years; 27 girls) who had been treated with PD (n=31) or HD (n=29) for 34±34 months. Patients were divided into two groups: normal cIMT and increased cIMT. Results: The mean levels of calcium, phosphate, and calcium/phosphate product were in the normal range, but the level of parathyroid hormone, 729±670 pg/mL, was higher than recommended by K/DOQI. Twenty-nine patients had increased cIMT and this was associated with time on dialysis > than 2 years, hypercalcemia, higher daily dose of calcitriol and HD (vs. PD) as modality of treatment. In multivariate analysis, accounting for time on dialysis, HD persisted as a risk for increased cIMT. Conclusions: The prevalence of increased cIMT in children on dialysis was similar to that reported in adults with CKD, and increased with time on dialysis. HD was associated with increased cIMT, independently of the time on dialysis; however, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the possible impact of other confounding factors. These results underline the need to monitor and, if possible, prevent and treat increased cIMT in children on dialysis.

N2  - Introduction: The concept of CKD MBD is traditionally based on studies conducted in developed countries. Aim of our study is to analyze the spectrum of CKD-MBD in other ethnic population like Indian patients. Methods: Prospective study from 2007 to 2009. Inclusion criteria - Age > 18 years & on MHD for 1 year. Analysis did, included: clinical examination, labs, DEXA & X-rays for vascular calcification (VC). We used DOQI/KDIGO guidelines for definitions & management. Results: 56 patients were analyzed (Average age 51 years; Males 71.45%; Diabetics 64.5%). Labs: PTH (pg/ml), <150 - 62.53%; 150-300 - 21.4%; >300 - 16.07% & normal (10-69) - 33.92%. Hypocalcemia, normophosphatemia, normal total ALP, & Ca++ × PO4 product of <55 (mg/dL) 2 were noted in 71.4%, 64.3%, 83.92%, & 96.4% respectively. DEXA (distal radius) showed severe osteoporosis in 86.65% (87.5% with PTH > 300; 85.7% with PTH < 150.). VC was noted in 71.4% (>55 years-82%; <55 years-12%). 14.28% had fractures [Asymtomatic 75% (rib/vertebral); symptomatic 25%]. None, had femur/collie's. Bone biopsy was indicated in 3.58%. Calcitriol/non-calcium based phosphate binders (CPB) and cinacalcet were indicated in 10.7% &1.73% respectively. Conclusion: Hypocalcaemia, normal serum phosphorous/ALP, adynamic bone disease, severe osteoporosis and VC with low Ca++ × PO4 product is the most common pattern seen, compared to western studies. No increased prevalence of fractures. Calcium supplementation ± CPB is the most appropriate cost effective treatment in our patients (88%). Indication for non-CPB/calcitriol is uncommon and that of cinacalcet/bisphosphonates is extremely limited.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: In a previous multivariable analysis of baseline characteristics in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) from ADVANCE (A Randomized Study to Evaluate the Effects of Cinacalcet Plus Low Dose Vitamin D on Vascular Calcification in Subjects With Chronic Kidney Disease Receiving Hemodialysis), the extent of baseline coronary artery calcification (CAC) was associated with plasma PTH concentrations, as well as male sex, older age, longer dialysis vintage, and diabetes mellitus. Once established, CAC tends to progress rapidly; however, factors associated with CAC progression have not been definitively established. We sought to extend previous analyses of risk factors associated with CAC among hemodialysis patients by identifying baseline demographic and biochemical features associated with progression of CAC. Methods: Adult hemodialysis patients (N=360) with sHPT and evidence of CAC (Agatston scores ≥30) were randomized 1:1 to cinacalcet (30-180 mg/day) plus low-dose vitamin D (≤2 μg paricalcitol equivalent/dialysis session) or to flexible vitamin D therapy. The evaluable efficacy set for this analysis consisted of patients with a CAC score at baseline and week 52 and no use of prohibited medications (cinacalcet n=115; flexible vitamin D n=120). We used linear regression to evaluate the relationship between percent change (primary endpoint) and absolute change (secondary endpoint) in CAC score (from baseline to Week 52) with selected baseline covariates [absolute and log2 transformed baseline total CAC, age (years), dialysis vintage (years), PTH (pg/mL), Ca (mg/dL), P (mg/dL), Ca x P (mg2/dL2) and coexistent diabetes] adjusted for treatment and baseline CAC strata. The magnitude of change (estimate (SE)) and strength of association (p-value) between change in CAC score and covariates were determined. Results: Higher baseline serum P and Ca x P were significantly associated with a greater percent change (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) and absolute change (p=0.018 and p=0.008, respectively) from baseline in CAC score at 52 weeks. Longer dialysis vintage at baseline was associated with a lower percent change (p=0.004) and absolute change (p=0.057) in CAC score. Higher baseline total CAC score was significantly associated with a lower percent change (p<0.001), but a greater absolute change (p<0.001), in CAC score at 52 weeks. Conclusions: Although, in the prior multivariate analyses, there were significant associations among age, diabetes, baseline PTH, and extent of baseline CAC, these baseline parameters were not associated with the change in CAC in this univariate analysis. Additional analyses are needed to determine the associations among treatment-induced changes in selected parameters of mineral metabolism and CAC progression.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is a phosphorus-regulating substance. FGF-23 has been suggested to play a role in vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) assessment and CCA plaque identification using ultrasound are well-recognized tools for identification and monitoring of atherosclerosis. As data on the association between FGF23 and atherosclerosis is limited in patients with chronic kidney disease, the aim of this study was to test if elevated FGF-23 levels might be associated with carotid artery atherosclerosis in maintenance haemodialysis patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, plasma FGF-23 concentrations were measured using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. CCA-IMT was measured and CCA plaques with degree of stenosis were identified by B-Mode Doppler ultrasound according to NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) range. Results: The study population consisted of 128 maintenance haemodialysis patients (65 women and 63 men, mean age: 55.5±13 years, mean haemodialysis vintage: 52±10 months, all patients are on haemodialysis thrice a week).The mean CCA-IMT were higher with increasing tertiles of serum FGF-23 levels (0.66±0.14 vs 0.75±0.05 vs 0.86±0.20 mm, p<0.0001). Serum FGF-23 levels were higher in patients with plaques in CCA than patients free of plaques (1239±378 vs 620±334 RU/ml, p<0.0001). Carotid artery stenosis increased with increasing serum FGF-23 tertiles (10±3% vs 22±4% vs 30±4%, p=0.001). Significant correlations were recorded between serum FGF-23 levels and CCA-IMT (r=0,497, p=0.0001) and carotid stenosis (r=0.395 p<0.0001). In multiple regression analysis, a high log FGF-23 concentrations were significant independent risk factors of increased CCA-IMT in addition to a high serum phosphate level, low serum albumin level, smoking and higher systolic blood pressure. Conclusions: Serum FGF-23 concentration is independently associated witk CCA-IMT, presence of CCA plaque(s) and degree of carotid stenosis in maintenance haemodialysis patients. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify whether increased serum FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential mechanism for peripheral arterial atherosclerosis in patients with end stage renal disease.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are exposed to vascular calcification (VC) and cardiovascular problems due to the classical risk factors for atherosclerosis and mineral and bone disorders, though, serum uremic toxins may play a role in VC development. The aim of our study was to evaluate findings of VC on plain radiograms and vessel histology in a selected non-diabetic and steroid non-treated CKD stage 5 cohort and their association with various uremic toxins and other biochemical and clinical data. Methods: In a cross-sectional study on 100 CKD patients (mean age 54.8±15.8 years, male 63%) scheduled for creation of arterio-venous fistula we obtained 3x1 mm arterial wall sample for evaluation of the presence of VC by Von Kossa staining. Blood samples were collected for various biochemical and uremic toxins (uric acid, hippuric acid, CMPF, indoxyl sulphate, indol acetic acid and para cresyl sulphate) analysis. We compared the patients with VC findings on plain radiograms and vessel histology to those being VC free. Also, patients with previous vascular problems (myocardial infarction and cerebro-vascular insult) were compared to those without such problems. Finally, the group of patients who developed any CVD event or died within the next 2 years of follow up were compared to the others who remained CVD free. The comparisons were performed with t-test or Man-Whitney U test for various nominal, and with Chi-square for categorical parameters, as appropriate. Results: VC on plain radiograms (confirmed by vessel wall histology) were found in 32% of patients. Interestingly, these patients had a significantly lower blood pressure, decreased levels of magnesium (1.0±0.2 vs 1.1±0.3 mmol/l) and carboxy-methyl-propyl-furanpropionic acid (CMPF), as well as higher levels of serum ferritin. Patients with a history of previous CVD events, were older, with lower PTH, cholesterol and blood pressure levels, but with significantly higher levels of total and free indoxyl sulfate (2.4±1.2 vs 1.7±0.9 and 0.3±0.2 vs 0.14±0.11 mg%, respectively). Patients who developed serious CVD events or death after 2-years of follow up were older, with higher levels of cholesterol, a greater proportion of previous serious CVD events, and with lower PTH and ferritin levels compared to the patients who remained disease free, being not significantly different in the evaluated uremic toxins. Conclusions: Vascular calcification development could not be always explained by the traditional risk factors and CKD MBD disorders. Low PTH, considered as an adynamic bone status, remains as one of the culprits for VC development. The role of uremic toxins needs to be further elucidated in order to possibly prevent and manage the development of VC and clinical outcome in CKD patients stage 5, but at least in two analysis indoxyl sulphate and CMPF correlated with previous events, corroborating the suggested association of this compound with vascular damage.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The rapid progression of atherosclerosis and vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is favored by the associated disorder of mineral and bone metabolism (MBD). The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of the phosphate binder lanthanum (La) carbonate with that of sevelamer-HCl on arterial calcification and atherosclerosis and also on bone structure and turnover in mice with chronic renal failure (CRF). Methods: After surgical creation of CRF or sham operation, respectively, 12 week-old female apolipoprotein E deficient (apoE-/-) mice were randomized to one non CRF group and three CRF groups and fed for a duration of 8 weeks with standard diet (Harlan 2918) alone (non CRF and CRF group), or with same diet supplemented with either 3% lanthanum carbonate (La3%; CRF group) or 3% sevelamer-HCl (Sev3%; CRF group). At sacrifice, blood was sampled for serum biochemistry as well as proteomic analysis and aorta and femoral bones were removed. Results: Compared with unsupplemented control CRF mouse groups, both the La3%and Sev3% supplemented CRF mice displayed a decrease of serum phosphorus, a reduction of arterial calcification at both intima (plaque) and media (non-plaque) of aortic root, and less atherosclerosis in thoracic aorta. (Table presented) There was a reduction of aortic collagen I expression with either phosphate binder, and in nitrotyrosine expression in response to sevelamer-HCl. Proteomic analysis showed that different detected peptide peaks were significantly modified by CRF state and at least one peak by Sev3% supplementation. Finally, mineral apposition and bone formation rates were increased in CRF mice compared with non CRF mice. This increase was corrected by Sev3%, but not La3%. Conclusions: Both La carbonate and sevelamer-HCl retarded the progression of vascular calcification and atherosclerosis in uremic apoE-/- mice. These effects could be mainly due to the control of hyperphosphatemia by the two phosphate binders, and likewise the reduction of arterial collagen I expression. The effect of La carbonate differed however from that of sevelamer-HCl in that it did not appear to exert its beneficial vascular effects via changes in oxidative stress or bone remodeling in the present model.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Levels of serum phosphate (SP) are associated with progression of renal disease, development of vascular calcifications and cardiovascular events in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Inflammation is a key factor in atherosclerosis and is a highly prevalent in CKD. We sought to determine whether changes in markers of inflammation predict SP changes independent of CKD progression or modify the relationship between progression of CKD and SP. Methods: Consecutive patients referred to a large CKD program between 2001 and 2006 were eligible for the study if they were followed for 2 yrs and their GFR at the time of referral was between 15 and 60 ml/min (CKD stage 3-4). Patients with GFR < 60 ml/min receive routine serial measurements of SP, serum Ca, PTH, albumin, C reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, urea and 24 hrs urinary creatinine, urea and protein excretion. Protein intake was calculated from urea excretion. ANCOVA was used to model SP at follow-up end as a function of change in CRP and its baseline values, controlling for GFR decline, associated mineral metabolism derangements, and markers of nutrition, including protein intake and serum albumin. Results: There were 227 patients (mean age 70 yrs, mean BW 74 kg, 66% male, 28% diabetics) satisfying the eligibility criteria. During the study GFR decreased from 32.5±11 to 29.9±14 ml/min (P< 0.01). SP and PTH increased from 3.4±0.6 to 3.6±0.8 mg/dl (P<0.001) and from 88±55 to 101±60 pg/ml (P<0.001), respectively. Serum Ca (9.5±0.5 and 9.35±0.5 mg/dl) and estimated protein intake (70±19 and 70±22 g/day) did not change. In 2 years 68 patients (30%) progressed to a worse CKD stage; the proportion of subjects with SP >4.3 mg/dl increased from 10% to 16%; and the proportion of patients with CRP >5 mg/L from 45% to 55%. Baseline SP and CRP correlated with GFR (-0.40 and -0.20). No correlation was found between SP and CRP. Changes in SP (-039) but not changes in CRP during follow up correlated with variations in GFR. Multivariate analysis (r2 0.47) showed that the main predictors of SP levels after 2 yrs were the decline in GFR, female gender, protein intake and calcitriol supplements. Serum albumin and CRP did not show any independent or modifying effect. Conclusions: 1) An inflammatory state is frequent in CKD stage 3 and 4, but does not seem to affect SP levels during the course of CKD; 2) GFR decline, protein intake and calcitriol therapy are the main predictors of SP levels during the course of CKD. Protein and phosphate intake restrictions and careful use of calcitriol are critical measures to control SP levels in CKD stage 3 and 4.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcifications is a common finding in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are associated with arterial stiffness and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate vascular calcifications by two simple plain X-ray scores in a cohort of patiens with CDK stage 4 and 5 non in dialysis and its realtionship with traditional and non traditional cardiovascular risks factors. Methods: We studied 177 patients, mean age was 63±13 years, 61.6% were men, mean Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR-MDRD4) was 20.8±5.6 mL/min, 80% CKD stage 4 and 20% CKD stage 5, 65% had diabetes, mean body mass index was 31.9±25, 50% had BMI>30, 45.8% of the patients had previous cardiovascular diseases (23.2% coronary artery disease, 16.4% cerebrovascular disease and 25.4% peripheral arterial disease). All subjets underwent a plain X-ray of pelvis, hands and lateral lumbar column and semicuantitave vascular calcification score of abdominal aorta, iliacs, femoral, radial and interdigital arteries were calculated as described by Adragao (SVCS) and Kauppila. 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was also registred. Assesment of biochemical parameters included lipid perfil, mineral metabolism, serum albumin, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, PCR and Homocysteine. Results: Only 23.7% of patients had no vascular calcifications according Adragao score and 55.4% had more than 3 points. Only 13% of the patiens had no vascular calcifications according Kauppila score, and 41.2% had more than 12 points. Table 1 shows the results of diferent variables according to SVCS Adragao and Kauppila scores: (Table presented) No differences were seen regarding BMI, calcium, phosphate, iPTH, total cholesterol or triglycerides. On multivariate analysis age, diabetes, 25 hydroxyvitamin D level and pulse pressure in ABPM were related with vascular calcification scores. Conclusions: Vascular calcifications are highly prevalent in CKD patients prior to dialysis initiation and they are related with some cardiovascular risks factors like age, prevalence of diabetes, hypertension and previous cardiovascular diseases. Low levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D seems to be a risk factor for the development of vascular calcifications. We could not see a relationship with other alterations of bone and mineral metabolism parameters.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla protein (MGP) acts as a calcification inhibitor in vitro andin vivo. The present study was performed in order to (i) determine plasma levels of the inactive, dephosphorylated, uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) in a cohort of patients at different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and (ii) evaluate the association between dp-ucMGP levels on one hand and aortic calcification and mortality on the other. Methods: 107 patients (67±13 years; 60% males; 32% at CKD stages 2-3, 31% at stages 4-5, 37% at stage 5D) were assayed for dp-ucMGP and underwent multi-slice spiral computed tomography scans in order to quantify aortic calcification at baseline. They were prospectively monitored for mortality. Results: Plasma dp-ucMGP levels augmented progressively with CKD stage, with a significant difference from CKD stage 4. CKD stage (p<0.0001), hemoglobin (p<0.0001), age (p=0.002) and coumarin use (p=0.006) were independently associated with plasma dp-ucMGP levels. Furthermore, plasma dp-ucMGP and age were positively and independently associated with the aortic calcification score. During follow-up (802±311 days), 34 patients died (20 from cardiovascular events). In a crude analysis, [plasma dp-ucMGP] > 921 pM was associated with overall mortality (p=0.006); this association was lost after adjusting for both age and the calculated propensity score. Conclusions: Plasma dp-ucMGP increased progressively in a CKD setting and was associated with the severity of aortic calcification. Plasma dpucMGP could thus be a surrogate marker for vascular calcification in CKD.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Patients (pts) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) present with microcirculatory alterations, attributed to: a) endothelial damage caused by oxidative stress, b) defect in skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism, c) obstruction due to microbubbles, which originate in extracorporeal lines, d) decreased coronary flow reserve, e) vascular calcification and f) vitamin deficiency. Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the acute effect of HD on the microcirculation as assessed by Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and the vascular occlusion technique and to correlate the microcirculatory alterations with dialysis parameters (filter, duration and adequacy). Methods: Thenar tissue oxygen saturation (StO2%) was measured noninvasively by NIRS (occlusion technique). The study was carried out in a Renal Unit. The vascular occlusion technique was performed in order to assess the oxygen consumption rate, the endothelial function and the vascular reactivity. Dialysis parameters (filter, duration and adequacy), the medical treatment, the aetiology of CKD and the comorbities were also recorded. Results: Measurements were performed in 20 HD pts (15 men, 5 women) with age 70±12 years, kt/V: 1,2±4, Et: 38±3,3%, on HD for 4.5±3 years, before and after one HD session. HD pts improved the oxygen consumption rate (32±17%/min vs 46.68±27%/min before and after HD respectively, p=0.035) inclusive of the smokers and the diabetics. The microcirculatory parameters prior to the HD session were: StO2 thenar: 77±4, oxygen consumption rate: 28±11 and vascular reactivity: 30±32. Conclusions: HD improved the oxygen consumption rate of the thenar. However, the limited number of pts included does not allow us to define conclusions concerning the effect of HD on endothelial function and vascular reactivity. Further studies are requested to confirm these results.

N2  - It is well established that both calcium containing and noncalcium containing phosphate binders (PB) increase gastrointestinal absorption of Ca, leading to increased serum calcium levels, low bone formation rate and increased risk for vascular calcifications, particularly in combination with vitamin D therapy. Due to the high serum calcium levels, renal clearance increases, leading to increased calciuria. Previously, we observed that administration of La2(CO3)3 to rats with renal failure does not induce this increased calciuria. Additionally, in dialysis patients, La2 (CO3)3 treatment has been associated with a less pronounced decrease in serum PTH compared to patients treated with other PBs. Since La is a powerful Ca channel blocker at 0.5 mM concentration in vitro, a concentration which can be expected in the gut during treatment, we hypothesized that La2 (CO3)3 treatment results in a smaller increase of gastrointestinal Ca absorption than other PBs. Male Wistar rats (normal renal function and chronic renal failure (CRF)) received a diet supplemented with La2 (CO3)3, sevelamer, CaCO3 or cellulose (2% of each) during an 8-day treatment period, followed by a 6-day washout period, during which non supplemented diets were used. Serum ionized calcium was measured daily. Animals with normal renal function show a statistically significant (p<0.05) increase in serum ionized calcium levels, starting after 2 days of treatment in the sevelamer group, which returned to normal within one day of washout. CaCO3 treated animals showed a smaller increase which was only statistically significant after 2 and 3 days of treatment. La2 (CO3)3 treated animals did not show differences vs controls. In the CRF animals, no statistically significant differences were found between the sevelamer, calcium and control groups. Animals treated with La2 (CO3)3 however, showed statistically significant lower serum ionized calcium levels, when compared to either of the other treatment groups within 2 days of treatment. During washout, levels returned to normal within 24 hours. Two non calcium containing phosphate binding agents, lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer, show a differential effect on serum ionized calcium levels, both in animals with normal renal function and chronic renal failure. Our findings may be of particular interest for treatment of hypercalcemic patients and/or patients with low bone turnover requiring phosphate control and may facilitate combination treatment with vitamin D.

N2  - Vascular calcification (VC) and impaired bone metabolism are frequently seen in combination with each other in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), diabetics or postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis is often observed superimposed upon the presence of renal osteodystrophy. The inverse relationship between impaired bone mineralization/increased bone loss and VC, the so called calcification paradox, is complex and not well understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of accelerated bone loss on aortic VC in rats with adenine induced CRF with or without ovariectomy (OVX). One week after ovariectomy (OVX) or sham operation (CRF-OVX and CRF resp.), CRF and VC were induced in rats by administration of a 0.75% adenine/2.5% low protein/0.93% P diet during 4 weeks. Ovariectomized rats with normal renal function, fed a 0.93% phosphate/low protein (2.5%) diet, served as controls (OVX). Throughout the study, VC and bone status were evaluated in vivo by micro-CT. At sacrifice (week 6) these parameters were also assessed by bulk calcium (Ca) analysis/Von Kossa staining and bone histomorphometry respectively. Serum PTH and FGF-23 were determined. Renal function was similar in CRF and CRF-OVX groups but significantly reduced compared to OVX group (serum creatinine CRF 1.15 mg/dl vs. OVX 0.47 mg/dl p<0.001). Serum Ca levels of CRF and CRF-OVX groups were significantly decreased and serum P, PTH, FGF- 23 levels were significantly increased versus OVX group, however, did not differ between both CRF groups neither was there a difference in the degree of VC. Trabecular bone loss was seen in all groups which persisted until sacrifice in the OVX group. In CRF and CRF-OVX groups, trabecular bone density restored after adenine withdrawal, which coincided with cortical bone loss and the development of VC. Cortical bone loss was significantly associated with more pronounced VC. Neither cortical bone loss nor VC were seen in the OVX group. The appearance of VC in CRF rats seems to be accompanied by inverse disturbances in cortical and trabecular bone and indicate that cortical rather than trabecular bone loss determines the development of VC in CRF.

N2  - Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no studies on the prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and a median urine protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification, measured by electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, male gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the severity of calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies need to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery calcification in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.Kidney International advance online publication, 17 March 2010; doi:10.1038/ki.2010.70.

N2  - Background: A number of studies have shown that the planned initiation of dialysis would be better for a keeping general condition in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Although the contemporary recommended threshold GFR for initiating dialysis ranges from 10∼12.5 ml/min according to KDIGO criteria, estimated GFR (eGFR) by MDRD formula might not always fit in japanese patients. The aim of study is to set the recommended eGFR for dialysis induction in Japanese patients by clarifying the association between eGFR calculated by Japanese coefficient (Am J Kid Dis, 2009) and clinical parameters. Methods: We investigated 39 Japanese CKD stage 5 (25 males) patients who were started on maintenance dialysis therapy from June 2007 to May 2009. This study is a sub-analysis of an ongoing prospective study that the Ethics Committee of Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine approved. eGFR was calculated from the serum creatinin values, using the abbreviated MDRD study equation modified by a Japanese coefficient; eGFR (mL/min/ 1.73m2) = 194×SCr -1.094×Age-0.287×0.739 (if female). Results: The median of eGFR was 4.48 mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI 4.15-5.25), which value was much lower than the contemporary recommended threshold GFR by KDIGO. eGFR significantly and negatively correlated to white blood cell counts (ρ = - 0.34, P = 0.037), phopsphate (ρ = - 0.54, P = 0.0004) and calcium-phosphate product (ρ = - 0.5518, P = 0.0003) although there were no relations with hemoglobin, serum albumin, total cholesterol, intact PTH and CRP. eGFR also showed significantly positive relation to the rate of weight loss over the past 6 months (P = 0.0257), which suggests that CKD5 patient who made the severer progress of wasting tended to consent to dialysis therapy with the higher eGFR. Conclusions: The recommended threshold GFR for Japanese patients would be lower than that of KDIGO guideline. In CKD stage 5 patients, even if apparently no symptom and no wasting, the lower eGFR was associated with the increasing white blood cells and poor control of phosphate that could induce inflammation and deterioration of vascular calcification, respectively. All patients with CKD stage 3∼4 had better enter the educational program for the planned initiation of dialysis.

N2  - Vascular calcifications have been previously shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis patients and a similar association has been shown for arterial stiffness. Nonetheless, the relationship between vascular calcifications and pulse wave velocity (PWV) have so far been little explored. The goal of this study is to verify the correlation among vascular calcifications and rigidity of arterial wall in patients at dialysis start. Accordingly, we investigated the association between aortic PWV and coronary calcification measured by computed tomography (TCscore) in 105 adult incident hemodialysis patients. PWV resulted increased in patients with the higher TC-score values; indeed, at univariate analysis PWV directly correlated with age (p=0.016), presence of diabetes (p<0.0001), serum phosphorus (p=0.0066), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.046), LDL-cholesterol (p=0.043), TC-score (p<0.0001), and inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure (p=0.036). At multivariate analysis, age, diabetes, serum phosphorus, CRP, LDL-cholesterol and vascular calcifications were determinants of arterial stiffening. Using the table “two for two”, we showed 6 false negative patients (high TC-score and low PWV) and 12 false positive patients (low TC-score and high PWV). The sensibility was 76% and the specificity 85%; the accuracy was 83%, the predictor positive value was 61% and the predictor negative value was 92%. Overall, a strong association between TC-score and PWV was seen.

N2  - We present 3 cases of calciphylaxis, better termed calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), which illustrate typical and atypical presentations of this disorder to discuss its classification, pathophysiology, and treatment based on a review of the literature. Of the 3 patients presenting with biopsy-proven CUA, 1 patient with proximal lesions expired in the setting of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and superinfection of ulcers, a second patient had an extensive distal ulcerative lesion that failed to heal and necessitated lower-extremity amputation, and a third patient with multiple small distal lesions experienced complete resolution of the ulcers. The classification, pathophysiology, and treatment of CUA are detailed here. CUA is a heterogeneous syndrome which typically follows a progressive course leading to loss of life or limb. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and low threshold for biopsy in at-risk patients. Parathyroidectomy is appropriate to rapidly lower the calcium-phosphorus product in the setting of marked hyperparathyroidism; additional therapy includes the avoidance of purported precipitants, medical lowering of the serum calcium and phosphorus, and promotion of wound healing with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

N2  - We have shown that renal injury and chronic kidney disease (CKD) directly inhibit skeletal anabolism, and that stimulation of bone formation decreases the serum phosphate. Most recently, these observations were rediscovered in low-density lipoprotein receptor null mice fed high-fat/cholesterol diets, a model of the metabolic syndrome (hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance). We had demonstrated that these mice have vascular calcification (VC) of both the intimal atherosclerotic type and medial type. We have shown that VC is worsened by CKD and ameliorated by bone morphogenetic protein -7 (BMP-7). The finding that high-fat-fed low-density lipoprotein receptor null animals without CKD have hyperphosphatemia led us to examine the skeletons of these mice. We found significant reductions in bone formation rates, associated with increased VC and superimposing CKD results in the adynamic bone disorder (ABD), while VC was worsened and hyperphosphatemia persisted. A pathological link between abnormal bone mineralization and VC through the serum phosphorus was demonstrated by the partial effectiveness of directly reducing the serum phosphate by a phosphate binder that had no skeletal action. BMP-7 treatment corrected the ABD and corrected hyperphosphatemia, compatible with BMP-7-driven stimulation of skeletal phosphate deposition reducing plasma phosphate and thereby removing a major stimulus to VC. Thus, in the metabolic syndrome with CKD, a reduction in bone-forming potential of osteogenic cells leads to ABD producing hyperphosphatemia and VC, processes ameliorated by the skeletal anabolic agent BMP-7, in part through increased bone formation and skeletal deposition of phosphate, and in part through direct actions on vascular smooth muscle cells. We have demonstrated that the processes leading to vascular calcification begin with even mild levels of renal injury before demonstrable hyperphosphatemia, and they are preventable and treatable. Therefore, early intervention in CKD is warranted and may affect mortality of the disease. © 2005 by the International Society of Nephrology.

N2  - In this article, a patient with chronic renal failure and probable secondary hyperparathyroidism is described; calcification of a variety of cardiac and other structures complicated the latter. Calcification of an occlusive thrombus in the great cardiac vein and coronary sinus was identified by echocardiography, although not initially appreciated as such. The echocardiographic similarity of this lesion to mitral annular calcification is discussed.

N2  - Background: Authors describe their experience in surgical treatment of secondary HPT considering the alternative between subtotal and total PTx with AT. Methods: 223 patients were operated on for secondary HPT. 154 subtotal PTx were carried out, 32 total PTx with AT, 26 total and only 3 glands removed in 12. Results: Results after 230 PTx seems to favour subtotal PTx because is a shorter and easier operation. Total PTx with AT is indicated in the presence of goiter, large or ectopic glands, in case of reoperation. The possibility of freezing some parathyroid fragments is the condition for total PTx with AT. In any case having assessed all our results we feel that the surgeon's personal experience and preferences may well be decisive since neither operation is intrinsically better than the other. Conclusions: All these type of operations considered, vascular calcification do not improve, normocalcemia is obtained in 24, 48 hours, ectopic calcification disappear in 1 year and osteodystrophy in 6-12 months.

N2  - We describe the development of necrotic ulcers with underlying vascular calcification in a 72-year-old man who had chronic renal failure. These lesions had surrounding ecchymoses. The patient had a normal serum calcium concentration, an elevated parathyroid hormone level, and findings consistent with a parathyroid adenoma on ultrasonography. We consider this another case of a characteristic cutaneous syndrome secondary to underlying vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism.
