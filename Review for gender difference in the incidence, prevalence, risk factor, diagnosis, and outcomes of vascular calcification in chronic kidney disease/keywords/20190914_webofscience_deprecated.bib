Abstract = {{Kidney stone disease is associated with cardiovascular outcomes; it is
   unclear whether stone composition is associated with differential
   cardiovascular risk. To analyze such association, we performed a
   cross-sectional study in which data were collected for patients who
   underwent at least one stone composition analysis from January 01 2015
   to May 30 2018. The original dataset was linked with the imaging
   database to identify those patients with at least one abdominal CT scan
   examination during the period of interest. In total, 180 patients were
   included. The outcome of interest was the presence of any abdominal
   aortic calcifications (AAC) computed from CT scans. There were 108
   (60.0\%) patients with AAC. Calcium phosphate content was associated
   directly with eGFR, inversely with age, and was higher among females.
   Uric acid content was associated directly with age and inversely with
   eGFR, was higher among males, patients with diabetes and high blood
   pressure. After adjustment for age and gender, there was a significant
   association between calcium phosphate content and AAC (OR 1.25, 95\% CI
   1.00, 1.56, p=0.045). No interaction by gender was found between calcium
   phosphate content and AAC (p=0.84). In conclusion, we demonstrated a
   significant direct association of AAC and the amount of calcium
   phosphate was found, suggesting an increased cardiovascular risk. Our
   study suggests that some subtypes of kidney stone disease deserve a
   closer cardiovascular risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundCardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in
   patients with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be
   an important link between bone loss and vascular calcification. This
   study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between central
   arterial stiffness and serum OPG levels in hemodialysis (HD)
   patients.MethodsBlood samples were collected from 120 HD patients, and
   the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured using
   a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of >10m/s was used to
   define the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed
   categorically into tertiles.ResultsOf the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2\%)
   were defined as the high arterial stiffness group, who had higher values
   of systolic blood pressure (p=0.038), serum calcium (p=0.007), and OPG
   (p<0.001) levels and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM,
   p=0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels were significantly
   associated with greater height (p=0.011), male gender (p=0.008), higher
   cfPWV values (p=0.020), and lower intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH,
   p=0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that
   cfPWV value was independently associated with DM (=1.83, p=0.008) and
   increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (=0.89 and 1.63 for tertile 2
   and tertile 3, respectively, p for trend=0.035) in HD patients.
   Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, in addition to
   age, DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum calcium levels, increasing
   tertiles of serum OPG levels (OR=5.34 for tertile 2; OR=7.06 for tertile
   3; p for trend=0.002) were an independent predictor of high arterial
   stiffness in HD patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated
   with cfPWV value only in the highest OPG tertile group (r=0.408,
   p=0.009).ConclusionA positive association was detected between serum OPG
   levels and central arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with
   high serum OPG levels may have greater influence of calcium load on
   central arterial stiffening.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Vascular calcification (VC) is one of the factors involved
   in the increased cardiovascular risk observed in chronic kidney disease.
   Sclerostin is known to be a down regulator of bone mineralization, and a
   potential molecule linking the bone-vascular axis. The present study
   aimed at measuring serum sclerostin level in both dialyzed and
   undialyzed cases and correlating its serum level with both vascular and
   valvular types of calcification.
   Methods: This case control study was conducted on 82 Egyptian subjects
   of comparable age and gender divided into 20 apparently healthy
   volunteers as well as 62 chronic kidney disease cases of whom 31 cases
   were under maintenance hemodialysis (HD) for more than 6 months. Serum
   sclerostin was measured using an enzyme immunoassay.
   Results: Significantly higher median serum sclerostin values were
   observed in each of dialyzed and undialyzed cases compared to each
   others and to control group. Serum sclersotin was positively correlated
   with old age, male gender, and VC in dialyzed cases, and inversely
   correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate in total number of
   cases. Diagnostic performance of serum sclerostin revealed a sensitive
   rather than a specific biomarker of both vascular and valvular types of
   calcification. Multiple regression analysis revealed an independent
   contribution of male gender, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and
   valvular calcification to serum sclerostin level.
   Conclusion: Serum sclerostin level could be used as a potential
   biomarker for both vascular and valvular types of calcification in
   chronic kidney disease cases regardless maintenance HD as a treatment
   modality.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundRisk of cardiac events and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are predicted by coronary artery
   calcification (CAC) independently. It is not clear to what extent low
   bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with higher risk of CAC and if

   score with total body BMD (tBMD) as well as with BMD of different
   skeletal sub-regions.MethodsIn 174 ESRD patients, median age 57
   (10th-90th percentiles 29-75) years, 63\% males, BMD (measured by
   dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; DXA), CAC score (measured by cardiac
   CT) and circulating inflammatory biomarkers were analysed.ResultsA total
   of 104 (60\%) patients with CAC >100 AUs were older, had higher
   prevalence of both clinical CVD and diabetes, higher level of high
   sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6
   and lower T-score of tBMD. Female patients had significantly lower tBMD
   and BMD of all skeletal sub-regions, except head, than male patients.
   Female patients with high CAC (>100 AUs) had significantly decreased
   T-score of tBMD, and lower BMD of arms, legs than those low CAC ( 100
   AUs); elevated CAC score were associated with tBMD, T-score, Z-score of
   tBMD and BMD of arms and legs, while no such differences was observed in
   males. Multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) analysis adjusted for
   age, diabetes and hsCRP showed that in females per SD higher CAC score

   per SD (0.17g/cm(2)) lower BMD at legs. No such associations were found
   in male ESRD patients.ConclusionsIn female, but not male, lower BMD, in

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Reduced kidney function increases the risk of death, but there is
   limited information on causes of death across stages of chronic kidney
   disease (CKD). We aimed to identify leading causes of death in
   community-dwelling individuals with differing kidney function.
   Methods
   Observational analysis from SCREAM, a healthcare utilization cohort of
   Stockholm, Sweden. We included all individuals who died during 2006-2012
   and had one serum creatinine measured in the year prior to death. Using
   the CKD-EPI formula, we calculated eGFR and stratified individuals
   according to CKD stages. Causes of death were classified as
   cardiovascular (CVD), cancer, infection and other, using ICD-10 codes.
   We compared age- and sex-adjusted differences in the proportions of
   deaths from each cause.
   Results
   Out of 89,117 registered deaths, 70,547 (79\%) had a recent eGFR
   estimation and were included in this study. Individuals had a median age
   of 82 (IRE 62-93) years and 52\% were women. The proportions of deaths
   from CVD increased with lower eGFR, along with the proportion of deaths
   from infections. Deaths due to diabetes and genito-urinary diseases
   increased. Deaths due to cancer decreased, but other death causes did
   not vary. Within CVD causes of death, the proportion of arrhythmias and
   heart failure increased, but ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular
   disease remained stable.
   Conclusion
   In a region-representative Swedish healthcare extraction, we observe
   differences regarding specific causes of death across different CKD
   stages. Increasing patient and provider awareness of this differential
   pattern of risk may have benefits for patient management, prevention
   strategies, and health service planning.}},

Abstract = {{Without a B-ultrasound result, if a doctor diagnoses a suspected patient
   using only the basic clinical features, such as age, gender, serum
   calcium, and urea clearance index (KT/V), the diagnostic accuracy will
   be very low (even less than 50\%). To solve this problem, a machine
   learning technology is proposed to intelligently diagnose cardiac valve
   calcification in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with peritoneal
   dialysis. Compared with classical classification technologies, the
   proposed method aims to develop a model that has both medical
   interpretability and high recognition performance. In terms of
   interpretability, the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system is considered a
   basic model due to its built-in interpretable ability. In addition,
   because the distribution of the positive class (cardiac valve
   calcification is positive) and negative class (cardiac valve
   calcification is negative) in the peritoneal dialysis patient dataset is
   unbalanced, a novel unbalanced TSK (Takagi-Sugeno-Kang) fuzzy system
   (B-TSK-FS) is developed using a novel unbalanced fuzzy learning
   mechanism. The corresponding results reveal that the B-TSK-FS method
   obtains promising results (the max testing accuracy is over 98\%)
   compared with classical machine learning methods for intelligently
   diagnosing cardiac valve calcification in ESRD patients with peritoneal

   beta-blocker use, were independent predictors of a positive CAC score.
   The highest preptin quintile of patients had a higher CAC level compared

Abstract = {{Background: Even before the onset of age-related diseases, obesity might
   be a contributing factor to the cumulative burden of oxidative stress
   and chronic inflammation throughout the life course. Obesity may
   therefore contribute to accelerated shortening of telomeres.
   Consequently, obese persons are more likely to have shorter telomeres,
   but the association between body mass index (BMI) and leukocyte telomere
   length (TL) might differ across the life span and between ethnicities
   and sexes.
   Objective: A collaborative cross-sectionalmeta-analysis of observational
   studies was conducted to investigate the associations between BMI and TL
   across the life span.
   Design: Eighty-seven distinct study samples were included in the
   meta-analysis capturing data from 146,114 individuals. Study-specific
   age-and sex-adjusted regression coefficients were combined by using a
   random-effects model in which absolute {[}base pairs (bp)] and relative
   telomere to single-copy gene ratio (T/S ratio) TLs were regressed
   against BMI. Stratified analysis was performed by 3 age categories
   ({''}young{''}: 18-60 y; ``middle{''}: 61-75 y; and ``old{''}: > 75 y),
   sex, and ethnicity.
   Results: Each unit increase in BMI corresponded to a-3.99 bp (95\% CI:
   -5.17, -2.81 bp) difference in TL in the total pooled sample; among
   young adults, each unit increase in BMI corresponded to a -7.67 bp (95\%
   CI:-10.03,-5.31 bp) difference. Each unit increase in BMI corresponded
   to a -1.58 x 10(-3) unit T/S ratio (0.16\% decrease; 95\% CI: -2.14 x
   10(-3), -1.01 x 10(-3)) difference in ageand sex-adjusted relative TL in
   the total pooled sample; among young adults, each unit increase in BMI
   corresponded to a -2.58 x 10(-3) unit T/S ratio (0.26\% decrease; 95\%
   CI: -3.92 x 10(-3), -1.25 x 10(-3)). The associations were predominantly
   for the white pooled population. No sex differences were observed.
   Conclusions: A higher BMI is associated with shorter telomeres,
   especially in younger individuals. The presently observed difference is
   not negligible. Meta-analyses of longitudinal studies evaluating change
   in body weight alongside change in TL are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) are exposed to
   increased morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular events. The
   primary underlying mechanism has been suggested as accelerated
   atherosclerosis in these patients. Our aim was to compare the
   atherosclerotic inflammation and calcification in subjects with ESRD on
   hemodialysis to that in normal controls utilizing
   fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission
   tomography/computed tomography (F-18-FDG PET/CT). Subjects and Methods:
   Forthy two subjects who underwent F-18-FDG PET/CT imaging were
   retrospectively studied. Twenty one were subjects with ESRD on
   hemodialysis (67 +/- 11 years old; 14 male, 7 female) and 21 were age-
   and gender-matched controls. Average standardized uptake value maximum
   (SUVmax) and SUVmean for 4 segments of the aorta (ascending, arch,
   descending, abdominal) and for the common iliac arteries and common
   femoral arteries were measured. Standardized uptake value maximum and
   SUVmean for right atrial blood pool were also measured as the
   background. Average SUVmax, average SUVmean, average SUVmax/background
   ratio, and average SUVmean/background ratio were compared between
   subject groups for all segments. Presence or absence of macroscopic
   calcification on CT images for each arterial segment based on visual
   qualitative assessment was also noted and compared. For statistical
   analysis, two-sided t-test was used for continuous variables, and
   chi-square test was used for categorical variables. We considered a P
   value of <0.05 as statistically significant. Results: Average SUVmax and
   SUVmean were statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD
   than in controls in all arterial segments. Average SUVmax/background
   ratios were statistically significantly greater in subjects with ESRD
   compared to normal controls in all arterial segments except for the left
   femoral artery. Average SUVmean/background ratios were statistically
   significantly greater in subjects with ESRD compared to normal controls
   in all arterial segments except for the right and left femoral arteries.
   Presence of calcification on CT was more frequently encountered in all
   arterial segments in subjects with ESRD, and was statistically
   significantly greater for the aortic arch, descending aorta, and right
   and left femoral arteries. Conclusion: SUV measurements representing the
   atherosclerotic inflammatory changes and macroscopic atherosclerotic
   calcifications appear to be accelerated in subjects with ESRD on
   hemodialysis compared to normal controls. Fluorine-18 FDG PET/CT is a
   valuable diagnostic tool for verifying and quantifying accelerated
   atherosclerosis secondary to ESRD.}},

Abstract = {{Osteoporosis (OP) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) independently
   influence bone and cardiovascular health. A considerable number of
   patients with CKD, especially those with stages 3a to 5D, have a
   significantly reduced bone mineral density leading to a high risk of
   fracture and a significant increase in associated morbidity and
   mortality. Independently of classic OP related to age and/or gender, the
   mechanical properties of bone are also affected by inherent risk factors
   for CKD ({''}uraemic OP{''}). In the first part of this review, we will
   analyse the general concepts regarding bone mineral density, OP and
   fractures, which have been largely undervalued until now by
   nephrologists due to the lack of evidence and diagnostic difficulties in
   the context of CKD. It has now been proven that a reduced bone mineral
   density is highly predictive of fracture risk in CKD patients, although
   it does not allow a distinction to be made between the causes which
   generate it (hyperparathyroidism, adynamic bone disease and/or senile
   osteoporosis, etc.). Therefore, in the second part, we will analyse the
   therapeutic indications in different CKD stages. In any case, the
   individual assessment of factors which represent a higher or lower risk
   of fracture, the quantification of this risk (i.e. using tools such as
   FRAX (R)) and the potential indications for densitometry in patients
   with CKD could represent an important first step pending new clinical
   guidelines based on randomised studies which do not exclude CKD
   patients, all the while avoiding therapeutic nihilism in an area of
   growing importance. (c) 2018 Sociedad Espanola de Nefrologia. Published

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to explore the association between serum Mg
   and cardiovascular mortality in the peritoneal dialysis (PD) population.
   This prospective cohort study included prevalent PD patients from a
   single centre. The primary outcome of this study was cardiovascular
   mortality. Serum Mg was assessed at baseline. A total of 402 patients
   (57\% male; mean age 49.3 +/- 14.9 years) were included. After a median
   of 49.9 months (interquartile range: 25.9-68.3) of follow-up, sixty-two
   patients (25.4\%) died of CVD. After adjustment for conventional
   confounders in multivariate Cox regression models, being in the lower
   quartile for serum Mg level was independently associated with a higher
   risk of cardiovascular mortality, with hazards ratios of 2.28 (95\% CI
   1.04, 5.01), 1.41 (95\% CI 0.63, 3.16) and 1.62 (95\% CI 0.75, 3.51) for
   the lowest, second and third quartiles, respectively. A similar trend
   was observed when all-cause mortality was used as the study endpoint.
   Further analysis showed that the relationships between lower serum Mg
   and higher risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were present
   only in the female subgroup, and not among male patients. The test for
   interaction indicated that the associations between lower serum Mg and
   cardiovascular and all-cause mortality differed by sex (P=0.008 and
   P=0.011, respectively). In conclusion, lower serum Mg was associated
   with a higher risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the PD
   population, especially among female patients.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
   (HoFH) develop significant vascular calcification early in life, the
   cause of which is not yet fully understood. Patients with chronic kidney
   disease have similar vascular calcification, with fibroblast growth
   factor-23 (FGF23) implicated in these patients.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there was a difference in FGF23 between
   patients with HoFH and age- and gender-matched controls and whether
   there is a correlation between FGF23 and serum low-density lipoprotein,
   total cholesterol, and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with
   HoFH.
   METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional review involving 30 patients
   with HoFH attending the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital
   Lipid Clinic in Parktown, South Africa, as well as 30 age- and
   gender-matched healthy controls. FGF23, fasting lipid profiles, calcium,
   and phosphate were measured. B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid
   arteries was done to assess the extent and severity of arterial
   calcification.
   RESULTS: There was no difference in mean FGF23 between the patient and
   control groups (62.07 +/- 26.42 pg/mL vs 63.69 +/- 19.84 pg/mL; P =
   .4621) nor was there any correlation between FGF23 and low-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol (P = .9483 and .8474) or total cholesterol (P =
   .9261 and .859). In the HoFH patients, FGF23 did not correlate
   significantly with any cardiovascular disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Serum FGF23 is not elevated in patients with HoFH when
   compared to non familial hypercholesterolemia age- and gender-matched
   controls, and there is no correlation between serum FGF23 and
   cardiovascular disease in patients with HoFH. FGF23 does not appear to
   be a major factor for arterial calcification in HoFH. (C) 2018 National

Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet is effective for the
   management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients.
   Changes to reimbursement of cinacalcet in Australia provided an
   opportunity to assess effects of medication cessation on biochemical and
   clinical outcomes in dialysis patients, including changes to novel
   biomarkers such as calciprotein particles (CPP). CPP are nanoparticles
   of mineral and protein in the circulation associated with increased
   vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease.
   Methods: Dialysis patients from a single center who ceased cinacalcet
   between August 2015 and March 2016 were included in a prospective
   observational study. Bloods were taken at the time of cessation of
   cinacalcet and at 1, 6 and 12 months. Clinical and biochemical outcomes
   were compared with an age and gender matched cohort of cinacalcet-naive
   dialysis patients.
   Results: Sixty-two patients participated in the study. Mean age was 69.6
   +/- 13.2 years. Biochemical changes over 12 months following cessation
   of cinacalcet included an increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH)
   (42.2 {[}IQR 27.8-94.6] pmol/L to 114.8 {[}83.9-159.1] pmol/L {[}p <
   0.001]), serum calcium (2.31 +/- 0.21 mmol/L to 2.46 +/- 0.14 mmol/L
   {[}p < 0.001]) and primary CPP (CPP-I) (p = 0.002). Changes in CPP were
   associated with an increase in PTH (p = 0.007), calcium (p = 0.002) and
   ferritin (p = 0.02) but a reduction in serum albumin (p = 0.001). Over
   the 12-month period, there were two fractures, five cardiovascular
   events, one episode of calciphylaxis, and one parathyroidectomy, with a
   mortality rate of 19\% (n = 13).
   Conclusion: Uniquely we report the effects of cinacalcet withdrawal in a
   real world setting with demonstrated increases in PTH, serum calcium and
   CPP subsets, novel CKD-MBD related factors, over a 12-month period.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular calcification (VC) is linked to post-transplant cardiovascular
   events and hypercalcemia which may influence kidney graft function in
   the long term. We aimed to evaluate whether pretransplant aortic arch
   calcification (AoAC) can predict post-transplant cardiovascular or
   cerebrovascular events (CVEs), and to assess its association with
   post-transplant plasma calcium levels and renal function in one-year
   follow-up. Our single-center observational prospective study enrolled 37
   kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without previous history of vascular
   events. Two radiologists evaluated pretransplant AoAC on chest X-ray as
   suggested by Ogawa etal. in 2009. Cohen's kappa coefficient was 0.71.
   The mismatching results were repeatedly reviewed and resulted in
   consensus. Carotid-femoral (cfPWV) and carotid-radial pulse wave
   velocity (crPWV) was measured using applanation tonometry before and one
   year after transplantation. Patient clinical, biochemical data, and
   cardiovascular/CVE rate were monitored within 1year. We found out that
   eGFR(1year) correlated with eGFR(discharge) and calcium based on
   hospital discharge data (=0.563, p=.004 and =51.360, p=.026,
   respectively). Multivariate linear regression revealed that donor age,
   donor gender, and recipient eGFR(discharge) (R-squared 0.65, p=.002)
   better predict eGFR(1year) than AoAC combined with recipient
   eGFR(discharge) (R-squared 0.35, p=.006). During 1-year follow-up, four
   (10.81\%) patients experienced cardiovascular events, which were
   predicted by PWV ratio (HR 7.549, p=.045), but not related to AoAC score
   (HR 1.044, p=.158). In conclusion, KTR without previous vascular events
   have quite low cardiovascular/CVE rate within 1-year follow-up. VC
   evaluated as AoAC on pretransplant chest X-ray together with recipient
   eGFR(discharge) could be related to kidney function in one-year
   follow-up.}},

Title = {{The relationship between poor nutritional status and progression of

Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although aortic calcification has a significant negative
   impact on prognosis in patients on hemodialysis (HD), risk factors for
   aortic calcification progression remain unclear. The aim of this study
   was to investigate the relationship between malnutrition and aortic
   calcification progression in patients on HD.
   Methods: Between April 2015 and October 2016, we treated 232 patients on
   HD. Of those, we retrospectively evaluated data from 184 patients who
   had had regular blood tests and computed tomography (CT) scans. The
   abdominal aortic calcification index (ACI) was quantitatively measured
   by abdominal CT. Nutritional status was evaluated using the Geriatric
   Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). A normalized treatment ratio of
   functional urea clearance was evaluated by Kt/V. The difference in ACI
   values between 2015 and 2016 was evaluated as a Delta ACI, and patients
   were stratified into two groups according to Delta ACI value: high (>=
   75th percentile, Delta ACI-high group) and low (< 75th percentile, Delta
   ACI-low group). Variables such as age, sex, comorbidities, dialysis
   vintage, serum data, and GNRI were compared between Delta ACI-high and
   Delta ACI-low patients. Factors independently associated with a higher
   Delta ACI progression (Delta ACI >= 75th percentile) were determined
   using multivariate logistic analysis.
   Results: Median values of ACIs in 2015 and 2016 were 40.8 and 44.6\%,
   respectively. Of 184 patients, 125 (68\%) patients experienced ACI
   progression for 1 year. The median Delta ACI and 75th percentile of
   Delta ACI were 2.5\% and 5.8\%, respectively. The number of patients in
   the Delta ACI-low and Delta ACI-high groups were 128 (70\%) and 56
   (30\%), respectively. There were significant differences in sex,
   presence of diabetic nephropathy, HD vintage, serum albumin, serum
   phosphate, C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, Kt/V, and
   GNRI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that
   independent factors associated with a higher Delta ACI progression were
   male sex, serum phosphate levels, HD vintage, and GNRI of < 90.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that poor nutritional status is an
   independent risk factor for the progression of aortic calcification.
   Nutrition management may have the potential to improve progression of
   aortic calcification in patients on HD.}},

   abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral arteries has been evaluated by plain
   radiograph, but the data on their outcome predictabilities are still
   limited. The present study investigated the role of abdominal aortic
   calcification (AAC) and pelvic arterial calcification (PAC) in
   predicting overall morality in non-dialysis CKD stages 2-5 (CKD 2-5),
   maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and long-term kidney transplant (KT)
   patients.
   Four hundred and nineteen patients were included. Lateral abdominal and
   pelvic radiographs were obtained. The degree of AAC and PAC was
   evaluated according to the methods described previously by Kaupplia et
   al. and Adragao et al. Patients were followed prospectively for 5 years.
   AAC and PAC scores correlated well with the correlation coefficients of
   0.442 for CKD 2-5, 0.438 for HD and 0.586 for KT (p < 0.001). Patients
   with AAC score > 6 or PAC score > 1 were older, showed higher prevalence
   of DM and had higher serum phosphate and PTH but lower serum albumin and
   eGFR. A more severe degree of AAC was associated with an increase in KT
   duration, whereas a more severe degree of PAC was associated with
   worsening kidney function and prolonged dialysis vintage. Kaplan-Meier
   survival curves revealed AAC score > 6 as a significant predictor of
   all-cause mortality in CKD 2-5 but not in HD or KT, whereas PAC score >
   1 was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in all three
   populations. After adjusting for age, the predictability of AAC was
   lost, whereas PAC remained an independent predictor of mortality in all
   three populations. Adjustments for cardiovascular and CKD risk factors
   including age, gender, BMI, DM, serum albumin, calcium and phosphate
   attenuated the predictability of PAC in HD but not in CKD 2-5 or KT
   patients.
   PAC was better than AAC in predicting mortality in CKD, HD and KT
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected
   in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with
   cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors
   associated with AoAC and analyzed the relationship between the factors
   including bone-derived biomarkers and AoAC. Methods: We enrolled 389
   stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using chest-X ray examination.
   Demographic data was collected in addition to serum levels of
   biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and
   fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). Results: Two hundred sixteen
   patients (55.5\%) had AoAC. Patients with AoAC score 4 were older, with
   a higher percentage being male, and exhibited lower serum levels of
   albumin and triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely associated
   with AoAC severity, and FGF-23was directly related to vascular
   calcification. Age, gender, and dialysis vintage were independent
   predictors of AoAC. Conclusion: MHD patients have a high prevalence of
   AoAC. The grade of AoAC was dependent on older age in association with
   longer dialysis vintage. Levels of circulating FGF-23 but not sclerostin
   were related to AoAC severity. Serum FGF-23 levels were independently
   associated with AoAC. (C) 2018 The Author(s) Published by S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {{Objective This report presents a part of a survey pertaining to drug
   burden in maintenance hemodialysis patients in Japan.
   Methods A patient-reported questionnaire-based survey was conducted from
   September to November 2016 in six regions in Japan.
   Patients A total of 700 patients (50-79 years old) on maintenance
   hemodialysis for >3 years and members of the Japan Association of Kidney
   Disease Patients (JAKDP) were provided with the questionnaire. They were
   randomly selected using stratified sampling according to patient
   distribution observed from the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy
   Renal Data Registry (JSDT JRDR).
   Results A total of 524 (74.9\%) patient questionnaires were evaluated
   {[}mean (standard deviation; SD) age, 66.6 (7.2) years; males, 63.4\%;
   dialysis vintage, 16.9 (9.1) years]. Patients' age, gender, and regional
   distribution were similar to the JSDT JRDR. They were taking an average
   (SD) of 16.4 (8.34) and 16.3 (8.55) oral medications/day on dialysis and
   nondialysis days, respectively. A majority of the patients were taking
   10 oral medications/day on dialysis (75.1\%) and nondialysis (74.4\%)
   days, with phosphate binders being the most taken (7.0 tablets/day). A
   similar proportion (74.4\%, 72.9\%, respectively) was taking >= 6
   different types of oral medications/day. Most patients were taking oral
   medications 3 (31\%, 33\%), 4 (24\%, 22\%), and times (31\%, 30\%) a
   day, respectively. The drug burden was similar on dialysis and
   nondialysis days and did not vary with dialysis vintage.
   Conclusion The number, type, and frequency of oral medications in
   maintenance hemodialysis patients are high in Japan. The proportion of
   phosphate binders was highest among the prescription medications.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The strong correlation between vascular calcification and
   cardiovascular risk, which is a major cause of mortality in hemodialysis
   (HD) patients, has been well established. Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of
   vascular calcification, and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is produced at the site
   of inflammation, which is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   The main purpose of this study was evaluating the correlation between
   fetuin-A and PTX3with some biochemical parameters effective upon
   vascular calcification in HD patients.
   Methods: We included 84 HD patients and 84 healthy controls matched for
   age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) in this study. Blood samples were
   drawn from all subjects and the serum levels of creatinine, urea,
   albumin, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), low-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol (LDL-C), parathyroid hormone, fetuin-A, high sensitive
   C-reactive protein, and PTX3 were measured by biochemical methods.
   Results: We found that the serum levels of PTX3, C-reactive protein
   (CRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, and P in the patient group were
   significantly higher than the control group but the serum levels of
   fetuin-A and albumin were significantly lower in the patient group.
   Also, fetuin-A had a significant correlation with high sensitive CRP
   (hs-CRP) as well as duration of dialysis. In addition, it was shown that
   the correlation between PTX3 and PTH was significant only in the patient
   group.
   Conclusion: In this study, increased PTX3 and decreased fetuin-A levels
   were observed in the HD patients. According to our results, these 2
   parameters may potentially serve as suitable markers for inflammation
   and prediction of vascular complications in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Renal artery calcium (RAC) has been shown to be associated with higher
   odds of hypertension (HTN). The purpose of this study was to determine
   if the presence and extent of RAC is associated with renal function. We
   analyzed cross-sectional data from the Multi Ethnic Study of
   Atherosclerosis (MESA). A subsample of 1,226 participants undenient
   computed tomography of the abdomen and also had venous blood samples
   measured for kidney function. RAC was the primary predictor variable and
   the following measures of kidney function were the outcome variables:
   estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary
   albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and chronic kidney disease (CKD)
   stage. :The analyses were adjusted for age, gender, race, height,
   visceral fat, dyslipidemia, diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension,
   interleukin-6 and abdominal aortic calcium (AAC). The average age of
   this cohort was 66.1 years (SD 9.7), 44.8\% (549 of 1,226) were men, and
   nearly 30\% had RAC >0. Compared with those with no RAC, those with RAC
   >0 were significantly older but not different by gender or race. After
   adjustment for age, gender, and race, those with RAC >0 had
   significantly higher visceral fat; were more likely to have
   dyslipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension, had a higher interleukin-6,
   and a higher prevalence of AAC >0. The mean eGFR and UACR among those
   without RAC were 80 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 21 mg/g, whereas these values
   were 78 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 55 mg/g among those with RAC. In fully
   adjusted multivariable linear regression models, the presence of RAC was
   associated with a lower eGFR (beta = 2.21, p = 0.06) but not with UACR =
   0.02, p = 0.79). In fully adjusted ordinal logistic regression, RAC as a
   continuous variable was associated with increased odds of being in a
   worse CKD category (odds ratio 1.14, p = 0.05). When measured by eGFR
   and CKD stage, there is a modest relation between RAC and kidney
   function. Further studies might involve clinical trials to assess the
   role of intensive cardiovascular disease risk factor management in
   patients with subclinical RAC to determine if this may prevent or delay
   the development and progression of CKD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Progression of arterial stiffness is associated with changes in bone
   mineral markers in advanced CKD}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of all-cause
   and cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease
   (CKD). There are limited prospective data however on progression of
   arterial stiffness in CKD, including evaluating associations with bone
   mineral markers such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble
   a-klotho (sKl).
   Methods: In this prospective, single-center, observational study,
   arterial stiffness {[}measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV)] and
   hormones influencing mineral homeostasis, including serum FGF23 and sKl,
   were compared between non-dialysis CKD stages 4/5 and healthy controls
   at baseline and 12 months (12 m). Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC)
   was quantitated using lateral lumbar radiography at baseline.
   Results: Forty patients with CKD {[}mean estimated glomerular filtration
   rate (eGFR) 19.5 +/- 6.7 mL/min/1.73m(2)] and 42 controls (mean eGFR
   88.6 +/- 12.9 mL/min/1.73m(2)) completed follow-up. There were no
   differences in age, gender and body mass index between groups. A
   significant increase in FGF23 {[}240.6 (141.9-1129.8) to 396.8
   (160.3-997.7) pg/mL, p = 0.001] was observed in the CKD group but serum
   phosphate, corrected calcium, parathyroid hormone and sKl did not change
   significantly over 12 m. At baseline, CKD subjects had higher AAC
   prevalence {[}83.8\% versus (vs.) 43.6\%, p = 0.002] and higher aortic
   PWV {[}9.7(7.6-11.7) vs. 8.1 (7.2-9.7) m/s, p = 0.047] compared to
   controls. At 12 m, aortic PWV increased by 1.3 m/s (95\% confidence
   interval, 0.56 to 2.08, p < 0.001) in the CKD cohort, with 30\% of
   subjects showing progression from normal aortic elasticity to stiffening
   (PWV > 10 m/s). Serum FGF23 was associated with AAC, abnormal PWV and
   progression of PWV at 12 m.
   Conclusions: Arterial stiffness and serum FGF23, both of which are
   associated with increased cardiovascular risk, increased over one year
   in individuals with CKD. Additionally, a significant association was
   found between serum FGF23 and arterial calcification and stiffness.
   Larger clinical studies and further experimental work are warranted to
   delineate the temporal relationship as well as the pathological
   mechanisms linking FGF23 and vascular disease.}},

   units). CAC scores correlated with BMD of legs and pelvis. BMDs of leg
   and pelvic sub-regions were significantly lower in patients with
   extensive VC. In multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age and

Title = {{Circulating GDF-15 levels predict future secondary manifestations of
   cardiovascular disease explicitly in women but not men with
   atherosclerosis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{241}},
Pages = {{430-436}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Elevated serum levels of growth differentiation factor-15
   (GDF-15), is an established risk factor for a range of cardiovascular
   diseases.
   We aimed to evaluate the predictive value of plasma GDF-15 as a
   biomarker for secondary cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients with
   atherosclerosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Secondly, we
   determined whether plasma GDF-15 was associated with carotid plaque
   characteristics.
   Methods: Circulating GDF-15 levels were determined by Luminex assay in a
   cohort of 1056 patients from the Athero-Express biobank. Composite
   endpoint was defined as major CVE, death and peripheral vascular
   interventions. Findings were validated in 473 patients from the
   independent Carotid Plaque Imaging Project biobank.
   Results: GDF-15 levels did not associate with secondary CVE in the total
   cohort. However, following a significant interaction with sex, it was
   found to be strongly, independently predictive of secondary CVE in women
   but not men (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1: HR 3.04 {[}95\% CI 1.35-6.86], p
   = 0.007 in women vs. HR 0.96 {[}95\% CI 0.66-1.40], p = 0.845 in men).
   This was also observed in the validation cohort (women: HR 2.28 {[}95\%
   CI 1.04-5.05], p = 0.041), albeit dependent upon renal function. In
   addition, GDF-15 was associated with the presence of plaque smooth
   muscle cells and calcification.
   Conclusion: High circulating GDF-15 levels are predictive of secondary
   CVE in women but not in men with carotid atherosclerotic disease
   undergoing CEA, suggesting a potential use for GDF-15 as a biomarker for
   secondary prevention in women. Sex differences in the role of GDF-15 in
   atherosclerotic disease deserve further interest. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Bone metabolism disorder is often associated with cardiovascular
   calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sclerostin,
   a novel candidate protein, has been identified to be involved in the
   bone-vascular axis. The aims of the current investigation were to assess
   vessel sclerostin expression and its relationship with circulating
   sclerostin levels.
   A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from January 2012 to
   December 2014. Thirty-two predialysis patients with CKD stage 5 who
   received arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operations were enrolled in this
   study. Radial arteries were collected and paraffin-embedded during the
   AVF operation, followed by immunohistochemical staining for sclerostin
   expression. In addition, serum sclerostin levels were measured by the
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   The prevalence of positive sclerostin staining in the radial arteries
   was 56.25\%. Sclerostin expression was localized in the artery media
   layer. Serum sclerostin levels in patients with positive sclerostin
   expression were much higher than in those with negative expression (p =
   0.018). Multivariate logistic regression analyses including potential
   confounders as age, gender, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP,
   serum sclerostin, corrected calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), Ca x P product,
   alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, and estimated
   glomerular filtration rate showed that only serum sclerostin levels were
   closely related to vessel sclerostin expression (p = 0.025). The area
   under the curve of serum sclerostin levels for predicting positive
   vessel sclerostin expression was 0.742 with 61.1\% sensitivity and
   85.7\% specificity (p = 0.008). The cutoff point for vessel sclerostin
   expression of serum sclerostin was 1591.53 pg/mL.
   Positive expression of sclerostin in the radial artery media layer was
   related to high serum sclerostin levels. Sclerostin may act as both a
   local and systemic regulator involved in vascular calcification.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Patients with chronic kidney disease have an extremely
   high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). In patients with
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery calcification (CAC) is
   associated with increased mortality from CVD. Methods: The present study
   aimed to investigate the risk factors for CAC in Korean patients with
   incident dialysis. Data on 423 patients with ESRD who started dialysis
   therapy between December 2012 and March 2014 were obtained from 10
   university-affiliated hospitals. CAC was identified by using
   noncontrast-enhanced cardiac multidetector computed tomography. The CAC
   score was calculated according to the Agatston score, with CAC-positive
   subjects defined by an Agatston score >0. Findings: Patients' mean age
   was 55.614.6 years, and 64.1\% were men. The CAC-positive rate was
   63.8\% (270 of 423). Results of univariate analyses showed significant
   differences in age, sex, etiology of ESRD and comorbid conditions
   according to the CAC score. However, results of multiple regression
   analysis showed that only a higher age was significantly associated with
   the CAC score. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the
   sensitivity and specificity of L-spine radiography for diagnosing CAC
   were 56\% and 91\%, respectively, for diagnosing CAC (area under the
   curve, 0.735). Discussion: CAC was frequent in patients with incident
   dialysis, and multiple regression analysis showed that only age was
   significantly associated with the CAC score. In addition, L-spine
   radiography could be a helpful modality for diagnosing CAC in patients
   with incident dialysis.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) on health-related quality of life (QOL) in patients with
   diabetic foot disease. We compared a group of 30 diabetic patients with
   ESRD requiring dialysis to a group of 60 diabetic patients without ESRD.
   Both groups consisted of patients with active diabetic foot disease
   (ulcer, Charcot, infection) and were matched with regard to age and
   gender. Self-reported QOL was assessed using the Short Form-36 (SF-36)
   physical and mental component summary (PCS and MCS) scores and the
   region-specific Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM). Diabetic foot
   patients with ESRD requiring dialysis were found to have significantly
   higher creatinine levels, lower hemoglobin levels, lower albumin levels,
   higher rates of peripheral arterial disease, and lower rates of Charcot
   neuroarthropathy than patients without ESRD. The median PCS was
   significantly lower in the ESRD group; however, no significant
   difference was found when comparing the median MCS and FAAM. Patients
   who ultimately died had a tendency to report lower PCS scores at
   baseline compared with those patients who did not die (P = .07).
   Patients who ultimately required major amputation also reported lower
   PCS scores at baseline. ESRD negatively affects physical QOL to a
   greater degree than mental QOL in patients with diabetic foot disease.
   The SF-36 may not be sensitive enough to capture impaired mental QOL
   because both groups had relatively high MCS scores. Low physical QOL may
   be associated with mortality and the eventual need for major amputation.}},

Abstract = {{Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for
   hemodialysis. The impact of vascular calcification process on AVF
   survival remains unclear and results of several studies about this issue
   are controversial. In the light of the new knowledge about the different
   susceptibility for calcification process in different blood vessels, the
   aim of our study was to analyze whether the calcification of AVF-blood
   vessels may have an impact on AVF longevity.
   The study included 90 patients, 49 males and 41 females, all of them
   Caucasians, with a mean age 62 +/- 11 years, on regular hemodialysis for
   more than 1 year with patent primary AVFs. Vascular calcification in
   AVF-blood vessels or in the anastomotic region was detected using X-ray
   examination.
   Calcification in AVF-blood vessels was found in 62\% of patients. Binary
   logistic regression analysis demonstrated that male gender, presence of
   diabetes mellitus and longer duration of AVF before calcification
   determination were associated with calcification of AVF-blood vessels.
   Using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for these standardized
   predicted values revealed that patients with present AVF-blood vessels
   calcification had increased risk to develop AVF failure with a hazard
   rate of 3.42 (95\% confidence interval 1.00-11.67; P = 0.049).
   Calcifications of AVF-blood vessels are found frequently among dialysis
   patients and may jeopardize the survival of native AVF. We suggested the
   local X-ray as simple and valid method for detection of patients that
   are at risk for AVFs failure which should be monitored more closely.}},

Abstract = {{Coronary arteries in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have
   been shown to exhibit more extensive atherosclerosis and calcium. We
   aimed to assess characteristics of coronary plaque in hemodialysis
   (HD)-dependent patients using optical coherence tomography (OCT). This
   was a multicenter, retrospective study of 124 patients with stable
   angina who underwent OCT imaging. Sixty-two,HD-dependent patients who
   underwent pre-intervention OCT for coronary artery disease were compared
   1:1 with a cohort of patients without CKD, matched for age, diabetes
   mellitus, gender, and culprit vessel. Baseline characteristics were
   comparable. Pre-intervention OCT imaging identified 62 paired culprit,
   53 paired non-culprit, and 19 paired distal vessel lesions. Lesion
   length, minimum lumen area, and area stenosis were similar between
   groups. The HD-dependent group had greater mean calcium arcs in culprit
   (54.3 vs 26.4, p = 0.004) and non-culprit lesions (34.3 vs 24.5, p =
   0.02) and greater maximum calcium arc in distal vessel segments (101.6
   vs 0, p = 0.03). There were no differences in lipid arcs between groups.
   There was a higher prevalence of thin intimal calcium, defined as an arc
   of calcium >30 within intima <0.5 mm thick, in patients in the
   HD-dependent group (41.9\% vs 4.8\%, p <0.001). There was a higher
   prevalence of calcified nodules in the HD-dependent group (24.2\% vs
   9.7\%, p = 0.049) but no differences in medial calcification or thin-cap
   fibroatheroma. In conclusion, in this OCT study, HD-dependent patients,
   compared with matched patients without CKD, had more extensively
   distributed coronary calcium and uniquely, a higher prevalence of
   non-atherosclerotic thin intimal calcium. This thin intimal calcium may
   cause an overestimation of calcium burden by intravascular ultrasound
   and may contribute to the lack of correlation between increased coronary
   artery calcification scores with long-term outcomes in patients with
   CKD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Based on native CT scans of the pelvic region using a standardized
   calcification score, evaluation of iliac vascular calcification was
   performed between 2008 and 2012 prior to listing for renal
   transplantation in 205 patients with chronic kidney disease. Vascular
   calcification showed a decrease from proximal to distal. The difference
   between the degree of calcification in the common iliac artery and in
   the external iliac artery was significant (P<.001). Risk factors for
   total iliac vascular calcification were age, smoking, sex, underlying
   renal disease, and diabetes. Multivariate analysis revealed age to be
   the most relevant risk factor (P<.001). The duration of hemodialysis
   correlated significantly with total iliac vascular calcification. As the
   introduction of the standardized surgical evaluation protocol, no
   transplantation has had to be broken off and no early graft loss due to
   calcification has occurred. Thus, careful scoring of vascular
   calcification prior to transplantation may be a valuable tool to support
   surgical decisions and to improve patient safety and outcome in
   increasingly older transplant recipients.}},

Title = {{Association between metformin use and below-the-knee arterial
   calcification score in type 2 diabetic patients}},
Journal = {{CARDIOVASCULAR DIABETOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in type 2 diabetes,
   and is associated with cardiovascular complications. Recent preclinical
   data suggest that metformin inhibits VC both in vitro and in animal
   models. However, metformin's effects in patients with diabetic VC have
   not previously been characterized. The present study investigated the
   association between metformin use and lower-limb arterial calcification
   in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk.
   Methods: The DIACART cross-sectional cohort study included 198 patients
   with type 2 diabetes but without severe chronic kidney disease.
   Below-the-knee calcification scores were assessed by computed tomography
   and supplemented by colour duplex ultrasonography. Data on anti-diabetic
   drugs were carefully collected from the patients' medical records and
   during patient interviews. Biochemical and clinical data were studied as
   potential confounding factors.
   Results: Metformin-treated patients had a significantly lower
   calcification score than metformin-free patients (mean +/- standard
   deviation: 2033 +/- 4514 and 4684 +/- 9291, respectively; p = 0.01). A
   univariate analysis showed that metformin was associated with a
   significantly lower prevalence of severe below-the-knee arterial
   calcification (p = 0.02). VC was not significantly associated with the
   use of other antidiabetic drugs, including sulfonylureas, insulin,
   gliptin, and glucagon like peptide-1 analogues. A multivariate logistic
   regression analysis indicated that the association between metformin use
   and calcification score (odds ratio {[}95\% confidence interval] = 0.33
   {[}0.11-0.98]; p = 0.045) was independent of age, gender, tobacco use,
   renal function, previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes duration,
   neuropathy, retinopathy, HbA(1c) levels, and inflammation.
   Conclusions: In patients with type 2 diabetes, metformin use was
   independently associated with a lower below-theknee arterial
   calcification score. This association may contribute to metformin's
   well-known vascular protective effect. Further prospective
   investigations of metformin's potential ability to inhibit VC in
   patients with and without type 2 diabetes are now needed to confirm
   these results.}},

Abstract = {{Background In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery
   calcification (CAC) and inflammation contribute to cardiovascular
   disease (CVD). Statins do not improve survival in patients with ESRD,
   and their effect on vascular calcification is unclear. We explored
   associations between CAC, inflammatory biomarkers, statins and mortality
   in ESRD.
   Materials and methods In 240 patients with ESRD (63\% males; median age
   56 years) from cohorts including 86 recipients of living donor kidney
   transplant (LD-Rtx), 96 incident dialysis patients and 58 prevalent
   peritoneal dialysis patients, associations of CAC score (Agatston Units,
   AUs), interleukin-6 (IL-6) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
   (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), use of statins and all-cause
   mortality were analysed. Cardiac CT was repeated in 35 patients after
   1.5 years of renal replacement therapy. In vitro, human vascular smooth
   muscle cells (hVSMCs) were used to measure vitamin K metabolism.
   Results Among 240 patients, 129 (53\%) had a CAC score > 100 AUs.
   Multivariate analysis revealed that independent predictors of 1-SD
   higher CAC score were age, male gender, diabetes and use of statins. The
   association between CAC score and mortality remained significant after
   adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, use of statins,
   protein-energy wasting and inflammation. Repeated CAC imaging in 35
   patients showed that statin therapy was associated with greater
   progression of CAC. In vitro synthesis of menaquinone-4 by hVSMCs was
   significantly impaired by statins.
   Conclusion Elevated CAC score is a mortality risk factor in ESRD
   independent of inflammation. Future studies should resolve if statins
   promote vascular calcification and inhibition of vitamin K synthesis in
   the uremic milieu.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to examine the relation between various degrees of renal
   function and coronary plaque morphology by grayscale and virtual
   histology intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). ADAPT-DES was a prospective,
   multicenter registry of 8,582 consecutive patients treated using
   coronary drug-eluting stents with a prespecified grayscale and virtual
   histology-IVUS substudy. A lesion-level analysis of study participants
   was performed by comparing IVUS parameters of culprit and nonculprit
   lesions across tertiles of estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl).
   Preintervention IVUS imaging of 762 patients identified 898 culprit and
   752 non culprit native coronary artery lesions. Patients in the lowest
   CrCl tertile were older, more often women, and more often presented with
   stable angina. Compared with the middle and upper tertiles, the lowest
   tertile was significantly associated with culprit lesion smaller mean
   external elastic membrane cross-sectional area (12.9 vs 14.2 mm(3)/mm vs
   14.9 mm(3)/mm, p <0.0001), smaller mean lumen cross-sectional area (5.5
   mm(3)/mm vs 5.8 mm(3)/mm vs 6.1 mm(3)/mm, p = 0.002), and more dense
   calcium volume (11.5\% vs 10.2\% vs 9.7\%, p = 0.02). Similar trends
   were found in the nonculprit lesions. Plaque rupture was least common in
   patients in the lowest tertile. On multivariable analysis, independent
   predictors of greater dense calcium volume were lower CrCl,
   hyperlipidemia, female gender, and presentation without ST-segment
   elevation myocardial infarction. In conclusion, in the present
   large-scale IVUS study diminishing renal function was associated with
   increased coronary calcification and decreased coronary vessel and lumen
   sizes, with a graded response according to the reduction in CrCl. In
   addition, these patients were more likely to present with stable angina
   versus patients with normal renal function who were more likely to
   present with an acute coronary syndrome. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Background: Sclerostin is an inhibitor of the wingless-type mouse
   mammary tumor virus integration site family/beta-catenin signalling
   pathway (W beta cSP), which plays an important role in bone metabolism
   and in vascular biology. It could act protective regarding
   atherosclerosis development through its effect on W beta cSP in vascular
   cells. Nevertheless, results of studies analyzing association between
   circulating sclerostin level (CSL) and atherosclerotic diseases (AD) are
   showing conflicting results. The aim of this study is to test the value
   of CSL as a biomarker of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis (SCA) in
   obese persons.
   Methods: The cross-sectional study included 50 obese persons without
   previous history of diabetes and AD. Participants underwent adequate
   anthropometrical, ultrasound and laboratory examinations, including 2h
   75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
   Results: Only the presence of SCA significantly indirectly correlated
   with CSL (p<0.05). Based on the median value of CSL, we formed two
   groups: low CSL (CSL<7.9 pmol/l) and high CSL (CSL>7.9 pmol/l). There
   were no statistically significant differences in general (gender, age
   and current smoking) and anthropometrical characteristics (body mass
   index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure),
   inflammatory (total white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation
   rate, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein and uric acid), glucose metabolism
   (fasting and 2h OGTT blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin and presence of
   dysglycemia) and lipid metabolism (low density lipoprotein cholesterol,
   high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A-I,
   apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a)) parameters between low and high
   CSL groups. Low CSL group had significantly higher incidence of SCA
   (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: CSL could serve as a useful biomarker of early
   atherosclerosis in obese persons without previous history of
   cardiometabolic disorders but the final conclusion requires further
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)-5b and osteoprotegerin
   (OPG) are specific and sensitive markers of bone resorption in patients
   with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The
   TRACP-5b level is associated with the severity of RA and CKD, while the
   OPG level is associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis
   and calcification, and can predict a poor outcome in patients with
   coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the impact of TRACP-5b on
   coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients remains unclear.
   Methods: A total of 71 CAD patients (57 men, 14 women; mean age: 69.0
   +/- 9.7 years) and 28 age-and gender-matched healthy subjects were
   investigated. The number of diseased vessels (a marker of the severity
   of coronary atherosclerosis) and the Gensini score (a marker of the
   extent of coronary atherosclerosis), as well as the OPG and TRACP-5b
   levels were measured in CAD patients. The TRACP-5b levels were
   classified into quartiles.
   Results: The TRACP-5b levels were significantly higher in CAD patients
   than in healthy subjects. Patients with higher TRACP-5b levels had
   higher OPG levels and Gensini scores than those with lower TRACP-5b
   levels. Higher TRACP-5b levels were associated with an increased number
   of diseased vessels. A multivariate linear regression analysis showed
   that the OPG level and the number of diseased vessels or the Gensini
   score were significantly and independently associated with the TRACP-5b
   level.
   Conclusions: These data indicate that the TRACP-5b level is
   significantly associated with the OPG level and with the severity and
   extent of coronary atherosclerosis in CAD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Controversy exists regarding the benefits and risks of
   warfarin therapy in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) patients. In this study, we assessed mortality and
   cardiovascular outcomes associated with warfarin treatment in patients
   with stages 3-5 CKD and ESRD admitted to the University of
   California-Irvine Medical Center. Methods: In a retrospective matched
   cohort study, we identified 59 adult patients with stages 3-6 CKD
   initiated on warfarin during the period 2011-2013, and 144 patients with
   stages 3-6 CKD who had indications for anticoagulation therapy but were
   not initiated on warfarin. All-cause mortality risk associated with
   warfarin treatment was estimated using Cox proportional hazard
   regression analysis, and the risk of significant bleeding and major
   adverse cardiovascular events were analyzed with Poisson regression
   analysis. Adjustment models were used to account for age, gender,
   diabetes mellitus, use of antiplatelet agents, and preexisting
   cardiovascular disease, and stratified by pre-dialysis CKD stages 3-5
   vs. ESRD. Findings: During 5.8 years of follow-up, unadjusted mortality
   risk was higher in CKD patients on warfarin therapy (hazard ratio {[}HR]
   2.34 with 95\% CI 1.25-4.39; p < 0.01). After multivariate adjustment
   and stratification by CKD stage, the mortality risk remained significant
   in ESRD patients receiving warfarin (HR 6.62 with 95\% CI 2.56-17.16; p
   < 0.001). Furthermore, adjusted rates of significant bleeding (incident
   rate ratio, IRR 3.57 with 95\% CI 1.51-8.45; p < 0.01) and myocardial
   infarction (IRR 4.20 with 95\% CI 1.78-9.91; p < 0.01) were higher among
   warfarin users. No differences in rates of ischemic or hemorrhagic
   strokes were found between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Warfarin use was
   associated with several-fold higher risk of death, bleeding, and
   myocardial infarction in dialysis patients. If additional studies
   suggest similar associations, the use of warfarin in dialysis patients
   warrants immediate reconsideration. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

   Subjects and methods. A total of 170 patients (median age 40 +/- 11

   echocardiography.
   Results. In the male group, body weight (70.2 +/- 12.3 vs 61.1 +/- 12.6

Abstract = {{Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with adverse
   sequelae of cardiovascular disease, renal failure, and premature death.
   The key factors that could contribute to the development of
   cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD include inflammation and
   vascular calcification. Serum fetuin-A, a alpha(2)-glycoprotein is a
   systemically acting inhibitor of extraskeletal calcification and is down
   regulated following inflammation. Purpose: To estimate serum fetuin-A
   levels in patients with CKD and to analyze its relationship with
   inflammatory biomarkers and calcium-phosphorus levels.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 80 patients with CKD and 80 healthy,
   age and gender matched controls were enrolled in the study. Serum levels
   of fetuin-A, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), calcium,
   phosphorus, albumin, lipid profile, glucose, urea, and creatinine were
   measured.
   Results: A significant reduction of serum fetuin-A levels were observed
   in patients with CKD (mean = 0.4416 +/- 0.17 g/L) when compared to
   controls (mean = 0.7527 +/- 0.18 g/L; P = 0.001). Serum fetuin-A levels
   also showed a significant negative correlation with creatinine
   clearance, hsCRP and calcium-phosphorus product and a significant
   positive correlation with albumin levels (P < 0.01).
   Conclusion: In CKD, progressive reduction of serum fetuin-A levels occur
   along with the gradual decline in renal function. The reduced production
   and increased consumption of serum fetuin-A in CKD could promote
   vascular calcification and contribute to the cardiovascular disease.
   Hence, in patients with CKD, measurement of serum fetuin-A could be a
   promising biomarker to prognosticate cardiovascular risk.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Calcium deposits in the aortic valve and mitral annulus have
   been associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. However, there
   is no accepted standard method for scoring such cardiac calcifications,
   and most existing methods are simplistic. The aim of this study was to
   test the hypothesis that a semiquantitative score, one that accounts for
   all visible calcium on echocardiography, could predict all-cause
   mortality and stroke in a graded fashion.
   Methods: This was a retrospective study of 443 unselected subjects
   derived from a general echocardiography database. A global cardiac
   calcium score (GCCS) was applied that assigned points for calcification
   in the aortic root and valve, mitral annulus and valve, and submitral
   apparatus, and points for restricted leaflet mobility. The primary
   outcome was all-cause mortality, and the secondary outcome was stroke.
   Results: Over a mean 3.8 +/- 1.7 years of follow-up, there were 116
   deaths and 34 strokes. Crude mortality increased in a graded fashion
   with increasing GCCS. In unadjusted proportional hazard analysis, the
   GCCS was significantly associated with total mortality (hazard ratio,
   1.26; 95\% CI, 1.17-1.35; P <.0001) and stroke (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95\%
   CI, 1.07-1.40; P =.003). After adjusting for demographic and clinical
   factors (age, gender, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension,
   dyslipidemia, smoking, family history of coronary disease, chronic
   kidney disease, history of atrial fibrillation, and history of stroke),
   these associations remained significant.
   Conclusions: The GCCS is easily applied to routinely acquired
   echocardiograms and has clinically significant associations with total
   mortality and stroke.}},

   predispose to the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities such
   as gender of the patients, adequacy of dialysis, diabetes, hypertension,
   hypercholesterolemia, levels of anemia, parathormone levels, and calcium
   and phosphorus levels in the GCC countries were comparable with those in

Abstract = {{BackgroundTo evaluate osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels in relation to
   cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease
   (CKD) on different regimens of renal replacement therapy.
   MethodsA total of 143 patients with CKD and 30 healthy controls were
   included in this study and divided into five categories, including
   predialysis patients with chronic renal failure (preD; n = 36), chronic
   peritoneal dialysis patients (PD; n = 36), hemodialysis patients (HD; n
   = 35), renal transplant patients (RT; n = 36), and controls (n = 30).
   Data on demographics, concomitant diseases and CV risk factors, serum
   OPG levels, and correlates of serum OPG levels were determined.
   ResultsSerum OPG (pmol/l) levels were significantly higher in HD (P
   <0.001 for each), PD (P <0.001 for each), and preD (P <0.01 vs. control,
   P <0.05 vs. RT) groups than RT and control groups. Diabetics than
   nondiabetics in HD (P = 0.008), PD (P = 0.024), and RT (P = 0.004)
   groups and males than females in PD group (P = 0.021) had higher OPG
   levels. Serum OPG levels were associated positively with age in HD (P
   <0.001), PD (P = 0.001), and in overall population (P <0.001).
   ConclusionOur findings revealed increased serum levels of OPG in
   dialysis and preD patients compared to RT and controls. In the patient
   groups receiving two dialysis treatment, the levels were worse,
   indicating a more pronounced vascular injury. Age, C-reactive protein
   (CRP), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and cystatin C
   (CysC) in CKD patients, CRP and PTH in the control subjects, and age and
   BMI in the overall population were the significant correlates of serum
   OPG levels.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a
   major complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduced bone
   mineral density (BMD) is associated with vascular calcification. Here we
   investigated associations between vertebral bone density (VBD) and
   coronary artery calcification (CAC), quantified by cardiac computed
   tomography (CT), and BMD quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
   (DXA), and their relations with mortality.
   Methods: In 231 ESRD patients (median age 56 years, 63\% males)
   comprising incident dialysis patients, prevalent peritoneal dialysis
   patients and recipients of living donor kidney transplant, VBD
   (Hounsfield units, HUs) and CAC scores (Agatston units, AUs) were
   quantified by cardiac CT, and, in 143 of the patients, BMD was measured
   by DXA of total body. Metabolic and inflammation biomarkers potentially
   linked to CKD-MBD were also analysed.
   Results: Patients with low tertile of VBD were older and had more often
   cardiovascular disease (CVD), and higher HbA1c (non-diabetics),
   interleukin-6 and CAC score. Low VBD was independently associated with
   higher CAC score (>100 AUs) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes,
   CVD, inflammation and cohorts. In Cox proportional hazards analysis, low
   VBD was independently associated with all-cause mortality after
   adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and subjective
   global assessment (SGA). The root mean-squared error of prediction
   (RMSE) showed a good degree of association between VBD and BMD evaluated
   from DXA. In receiver operator characteristics curve (ROC) analysis,
   lower VBD was more strongly associated with higher CAC score and
   all-cause mortality than BMD evaluated from DXA.
   Conclusions: While assessments of BMD by DXA and CT showed good degree
   of agreement, associations of high CAC, and mortality, with low VBD were
   stronger than those based on low BMD by DXA. The strong independent
   associations of low VBD with high CAC score and increased mortality risk
   suggest that VBD may serve as an important prognosticator in ESRD
   patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Increasing evidence indicated that phosphorus emerged as an
   important cardiovascular risk factor in patients with chronic kidney
   disease (CKD). The fact that serum phosphorus was closely linked to
   vascular and valvar calcification may account for one important reason.
   However, left ventricular remodeling may also serve as another potential
   mechanism of the cardiac toxicity of phosphorus. In the present study,
   we evaluated the association of serum phosphorus with left ventricular
   remodeling.
   Methods: We investigated consecutive hospitalized patients with
   pre-dialysis CKD, who did not have symptomatic heart failure or take any
   phosphorus binder or calcitriol medications. Transthoracic
   echocardiography was applied to assess their left ventricular remodeling
   indices, both structural and functional.
   Results: The 296 study subjects ( mean age 56.4 years) included 169
   (57.1\%) men, 203 (68.6\%) hypertensive patients. In addition to gender,
   systolic blood pressure, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum
   phosphorus was an independent determinant of left ventricular mass index
   (LVMI, P = 0.001). Similarly, serum phosphorus was also a determinant of
   left ventricular end diastolic dimension (P = 0.0003), but not of
   relative wall thickness. In multivariate logistic analyses, serum
   phosphorus was significantly and independently associated with the
   prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, odds ratio {[}OR] 2.38
   for each 1 mmol/L increase, 95\% CI 1.20-4.75, P = 0.01). Moreover, the
   association was only confirmatory in eccentric LVH (OR 3.01, 95\% CI
   1.43-6.32, P = 0.003) but not in concentric LVH (1.38, 95\% CI,
   0.54-3.49, P = 0.50).
   Conclusion: Serum phosphorus was significantly and independently
   associated with LVMI and the prevalence of eccentric LVH in hospitalized
   patients with CKD. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

   designed to evaluate the impact of sevelamer (SV) vs. calcium salts (CS)
   on survival in incident dialysis patients. Results: We recruited 466

   administered to a portion of patients as part of their routine care. We
   tested the impact of CC and VD on survival in the overall and in both
   treatment arms of the original study cohort. Overall SV, but not CC or
   VD, administration was associated with a survival benefit (mean
   follow-up: 28 (10) months). However, a significant (p = 0.006)
   interaction of SV and CC on mortality was observed. CC use was
   associated with improved survival if administered in combination with SV
   (HR 0.34, 95\% CI 0.14 - 0.81, p = 0.01 for subjects receiving or not

Abstract = {{Background: The adipocytokine leptin is an independent cardiovascular
   risk factor and exerts proatherogenic effect. Preexisting vascular
   disease is an important cause of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation
   failure. We explored the association between serum leptin, pre-existing
   vascular disease, and AVF maturation failure in incident hemodialysis
   patients.
   Methods: Vein samples from 62 patients were collected at the time of AVF
   creation. Pre-existing vascular disease was evaluated with histologic
   changes and immunohistochemical characteristics of cellular phenotypes
   in intima AVF maturation failure was defined as an AVF that could not be
   used successfully by the third month after its creation.
   Results: The prevalence of body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2) was 17\%, and
   AVF maturation failure occurred in 28 (45\%) patients. Patients within
   the highest leptin tertile showed significantly higher maturation
   failure rate, independent of age, gender, diabetes, and body mass index.
   On histologic examination, significant differences in intimal
   hyperplasia (13.3 4.5 vs 18.2 +/- 5.2 vs 30.3 +/- 14.3 mu m) and medial
   thickening (76.8 +/- 23.7 vs 103.9 +/- 33.6 vs 109.3 +/- 36.5 mu m) were
   observed across leptin tertiles. Similarly, medial fibrosis was most
   severe in the highest tertile. According to the immunohistochemical
   staining, most intimal cells were alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive,
   vimentin-positive, desmin-negative myofibroblasts. However, in the
   lowest tertile, desmin-positive contractile smooth muscle cells were
   also frequently observed, suggesting relatively slow phenotypic changes
   in this group. Furthermore, as leptin tertiles increased, the expression
   of leptin receptor in the luminal border of intima was significantly
   decreased.
   Conclusions: Obesity-related higher fistula maturation failure rate may
   be partly mediated by higher leptin level-associated pre-existing
   vascular diseases in end-stage renal disease patients. Decreased
   expression of leptin receptor may be related to this association.}},

Abstract = {{Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) is a serious complication of diabetes
   mellitus (DM) that can lead to pedal ulceration, infection,

   also found in patients with diabetic foot disease; however, its
   prevalence in patients with CN has not been extensively evaluated. The
   aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of PAD in a
   group of patients with CN (with and without ulceration) and compare this
   to a group of patients with diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) and no CN. We
   compared the lower extremity noninvasive arterial testing results of 85
   patients with DM and CN with those from a group of 126 patients with DFU
   and no CN. No statistically significant differences were found in age,
   gender, type of DM (1 versus 2), insulin use, duration of DM, or history
   of dialysis between our study and control groups. The prevalence of PAD
   in the patients with CN was 40\%. Compared with patients with DFUs, the
   patients with CN were less likely to have PAD (odds ratio 0.48, 95\%

Abstract = {{Background/Aims Vascular calcifications (VCs) and fractures are major
   complications of chronic kidney disease. Hemodialysis patients have a
   high prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and an increased risk of
   thromboembolism, which should be prevented with warfarin, a drug
   potentially causing increased risk of VCs and fractures. Aim of this
   study is evaluating, in hemodialysis patients with and without AF, the
   prevalence of VCs and fractures, as well as identifying the associated
   risk factors.
   Methods A total of 314 hemodialysis patients were recruited, 101 with
   documented AF and 213 without AF. Comorbidities, chronic kidney disease
   mineral and bone disorder blood tests and therapies were collected.
   Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for the
   detection of fractures, defined as vertebral body reduction by >= 20 \%.
   In the same radiograph, the length of aortic calcification was also
   measured. Logistic regression models were applied for evaluating the
   independent predictors of presence of VCs and vertebral fractures.
   Results In our population VCs were very common (>85 \%). Severe VCs (>10
   cm) were more common in patients with AF (76 \%) than in patients
   without (33 \%). Vertebral fractures were present in 54 \% of patients.
   Multivariable analysis showed that AF (OR 5.41, 95 \% CI 2.30-12.73) and
   25(OH) vitamin D <20 ng/mL (OR 2.05, 95 \% CI 1.10-3.83) were

   fractures.
   Conclusions Hemodialysis patients had an elevated prevalence of severe
   VCs, especially when affected by AF. Low vitamin D levels were strongly
   associated with severe VCs. Prevalence of vertebral fractures was also
   remarkably high and associated with older age and male gender.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine whether breast arterial calcifications (BAC) seen
   on mammography correlates with coronary artery calcium score on coronary
   CT as it may serve as a potential marker for increased risk of
   developing symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD).
   Materials and methods: Retrospective review of the imaging database at
   our institution identified 145 female patients who underwent coronary CT
   within a year of screening or diagnostic mammography. The coronary
   calcium score on CT was calculated by multiplying area of calcification
   by weighted value assigned to its highest Hounsfield unit and summed for
   all lesions and expressed as Agaston score. Calculated scores were risk
   stratified for developing CAD as follows: 0 no risk; 1-10 minimal;
   11-100 mild; 101-400 moderate; >400 high risk. Percentile distribution
   of calcium score adjusted by age, gender and race was calculated based
   on results of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), which
   excluded patient with diabetes and chronic renal disease. The mammograms
   were reviewed by MQSAcertified breast radiologists who were blinded to
   patients' coronary calcium scores. Mammograms were interpreted for
   presence or absence of BAC. The calcium scores and corresponding
   percentiles were correlated with BAC on mammography. Cardiac risk
   factors such as, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, family history
   of CAD and smoking, were recorded for each patient.
   Results: BAC correlated with coronary calcium score of >11 (p = 0.0001),
   corresponding to mild or greater risk of developing CAD. Specifically,
   coronary calcium score of >11 was seen in 68\% (25/37) of patients with
   BAC and 31\% (34/108) of patients without BAC. Accounting for race,
   gender and age, presence of BAC showed statistically significant
   correlation with percentile scores of >25. Namely, 70.4\% (19/27) of
   patients with BAC vs. 44.6\% (41/92) of patient without BAC showed
   percentile score of >25 for developing CAD. Statistically significant
   association was observed of BAC with diabetes (p = 0.01) and chronic
   renal disease (p = 0.005). BAC showed no significant associated with
   hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking and family history of CAD.
   Conclusion: BAC does predict coronary artery calcium score of >11, which
   indicates mild or greater risk of developing CAD. In addition,
   statistically significant correlation exists between BAC and cardiac
   risk factors, namely diabetes and chronic renal disease. Our study
   suggests that BAC on mammography can be utilized as a potential marker
   for increased risk of developing CAD. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: The relationship between mineral metabolism
   disorders, bone fractures and vascular calcifications in kidney
   transplant recipients has not been established.
   Method: We performed a cross-sectional study in 727 stable recipients
   from 28 Spanish transplant clinics. Mineral metabolism parameters, the
   semi-quantification of vertebral fractures and abdominal aortic
   calcifications were determined centrally.
   Results: Vitamin D deficiency (250HD(3) <15 ng/ml) was more common in
   female recipients at CKD-T stages I-III (29.6\% vs 44.4\%; p = 0.003).
   The inverse and significant correlation between 250HD(3) and PTH was
   gender-specific and women exhibited a steeper slope than men (p = 0.01).
   Vertebral fractures (VFx) with deformity grade >= 2 were observed in
   15\% of recipients. Factors related to VFx differed by gender; in males,
   age (OR 1.04; 95\% CI 1.01-1.06) and CsA treatment (OR: 3.2; 95\% CI:
   1.6-6.3); in females, age (OR 1.07; 95\% CI: 1.03-1.12) and PTH levels
   (OR per 100 pg/ml increase: 1.27; 95\% CI: 1.043-1.542). Abdominal
   aortic calcifications were common (67.2\%) and related to classical risk
   factors but not to mineral metabolism parameters.
   Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is more common among female kidney
   transplant recipients at earlier CKD-T stages, and it contributes to
   secondary hyperparathyroidism. Prevalent vertebral fractures are only
   related to high serum PTH levels in female recipients. (C) 2016 Sociedad

   Methods and results Echocardiography was performed in 861 patients with
   PAD to detect abnormal cardiac findings. Relationships between VHD and
   risk factors were analysed. The prevalence of VHD was 43.6\%, and the
   prevalences of aortic valve regurgitation (AR), mitral valve
   regurgitation (MR), aortic valve stenosis (AS), mitral valve stenosis
   (MS), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) were 26.8, 19.7, 5.9, 1.3, and
   9.4\%, respectively. In stepwise multiple regression analysis, severity
   of AR was related to age, albumin, and estimated glomerular filtration
   rate (eGFR); MR was related to eGFR and age; AS was related to eGFR,
   Lp(a), and age; MS was related to Lp(a) and female gender; and TR was
   related to age, body mass index, and total cholesterol (all P < 0.05).

Title = {{POEMS syndrome and calciphylaxis: an unrecognized cause of abnormal
   small vessel calcification}},
Journal = {{ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{APR 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Calciphylaxis is a syndrome consisting of vascular
   calcification, thrombosis, and skin necrosis. The syndrome develops
   often in chronic hemodialysis patients. However, there have been several
   case reports on calciphylaxis in patients with POEMS (polyneuropathy,
   organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes) syndrome, a
   systemic disease associated with plasma cell dyscrasia and upregulation
   of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
   Methods: In 76 POEMS patients and 86 age- and gender-matched disease
   controls, we studied abnormal small vessel calcification by computed
   tomography (CT) of the soft tissues. Clinical and laboratory profiles
   were compared between POEMS patients with and without calciphylaxis.
   Histological examination was performed in six autopsy cases.
   Results: Small vessel calcification on CT was found in 17 \% of POEMS
   patients and in none of the controls (P < 0.001). Autopsy confirmed
   calciphylaxis in 2 (33 \%) patients. Among POEMS patients, higher
   disease activity, including more severe neuropathy and ascites, higher
   serum levels of interleukin-6, and lower serum albumin levels, was
   associated with the development of calciphylaxis. Serum levels of
   creatinine, calcium, and phosphate were not related to the presence of
   calciphylaxis.
   Conclusions: Calciphylaxis is often present in patients with POEMS
   syndrome. Upregulation of multiple inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF
   and interleukin-6 may contribute to the development of calciphylaxis, by
   entirely different mechanism from that in chronic dialysis. POEMS
   syndrome should be recognized as a potential cause of calciphylaxis.}},

Abstract = {{Background-Although clear evidence shows that chronic kidney disease is
   a predictor of cardiovascular events, death, and accelerated coronary
   artery disease (CAD) progression, it remains unknown whether CAD is a
   predictor of progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal
   disease. We sought to assess whether CAD adds prognostic information to
   established predictors of progression to dialysis in patients with
   chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and anemia.
   Methods and Results-Using the previously described Trial to Reduce
   Cardiovascular Events With Aranesp Therapy (TREAT) population, we
   compared baseline characteristics of patients with and without CAD. Cox
   proportional hazards models were used to assess the association between
   CAD and the outcomes of end-stage renal disease and the composite of
   death or end-stage renal disease. Of the 4038 patients, 1791 had a
   history of known CAD. These patients were older (mean age 70 versus 65
   years, P<0.001) and more likely to have other cardiovascular disease.
   CAD patients were less likely to have marked proteinuria (29\% versus
   39\%, P<0.001), but there was no significant difference in estimated
   glomerular filtration rate between the 2 groups. After adjusting for
   age, sex, race, estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria,
   treatment group, and 14 other renal risk factors, patients with CAD were
   significantly more likely to progress to end-stage renal disease
   (adjusted hazard ratio 1.20 {[}95\% CI 1.01-1.42], P=0.04) and to have
   the composite of death or end-stage renal disease (adjusted hazard ratio
   1.15 {[}95\% CI 1.01-1.30], P=0.03).
   Conclusions-In patients with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and
   anemia, a history of CAD is an independent predictor of progression to
   dialysis. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, a history of CAD
   contributes important prognostic information to traditional risk factors
   for worsening renal disease.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients have a high prevalence of vascular
   calcifications, and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death
   in this population. Magnesium (Mg) depletion may be the missing link
   between multiple cardiovascular risk factors and the development of
   atherosclerosis. In this study, we aimed to assess the relationship
   between serum Mg levels and vascular stiffness in children with CKD on
   regular hemodialysis (HD). The study included 25 children with CKD on
   regular HD in our center; the study included also 25 healthy children
   age-and sex-matched as a control group. Serum Mg levels were measured,
   and Doppler ultrasound assessment of the intima-media thickness (IMT)
   and the peak systolic velocities (PSVs) of the main arteries including
   the (aorta, carotid, and femoral) arteries were recorded in the study
   patients. There were significantly lower serum Mg levels in children on
   regular HD than in the controls (1.7 0.43 mg/dL vs. 2.31 0.12 mg/dL,
   respectively, P = 0.001). There was a significant increase in the aorta
   and carotid IMT in the study group than in the controls (0.45 0.07 mm
   vs. 0.40 0.09 mm; 0.98 0.57 mm vs. 0.55 0.1 mm, P = 0.034 and 0.001,
   respectively), whereas there were no significant differences regarding
   the PSV of the carotid, aorta, and femoral arteries between the study
   patients and the controls (P > 0.05). A negative correlation was found
   between serum Mg level with aortic IMT (AIMT) (r = 0.682; P = 0.000). In
   addition, a significant negative correlation was found between the AIMT
   with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.447, P = 0.025, 0.472,
   P = 0.017), respectively. We conclude that lower serum Mg levels were
   associated with vascular calcification in chronic HD children.
   Confirmation of our results warrants further study.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Cardiovascular (CV) events are the leading cause of morbidity and
   mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those
   patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Fibroblast growth factor 23
   (FGF23) has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and
   mortality in patients with CKD. However, the role of FGF23 in uremic
   vasculopathy remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the
   relationship between FGF23 and LVH, endothelial dysfunction, vascular
   calcification, and arterial stiffness in 48 stable PD patients. Methods:
   Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed using 2-D
   echocardiography. Intact FGF23 blood levels were evaluated using an
   ELISA kit (Immutopics, Inc., San Clemente, CA, USA). Reactive hyperemia
   index (RHI) is a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction and the
   augmentation index (AI) is a surrogate marker of arterial stiffness.
   Both were assessed using peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT 2000).
   Vascular calcification (VC) was assessed using the Adragao score.
   Results: In unadjusted analysis; FGF23 was positively correlated with
   serum Pi (r = 0.487, p < 0.001), serum urea (r = 0.351, p = 0.015),
   serum creatinine (r = 0.535, p < 0.001), dialysis vintage (r = 0.309, p
   = 0.033), and LVMI (r = 0.369, p = 0.027) and was negatively correlated
   with age (r = -0.343, p = 0.017), residual renal function (r = -0.359, p
   < 0.012), and AI (r = -0.304, p = 0.038). In multivariate adjusted
   analysis, FGF23 was associated with LVMI (beta = 0.298, p = 0.041),
   serum Pi (beta = 0.345, p = 0.018), and age (beta = -0.372, p = 0.007)
   independent of dialysis vintage, gender, residual renal function (RRF),
   albumin, C-reactive protein and systolic blood pressure. There were no
   associations found between FGF23 and RHI, AI, or VC in
   multivariable-adjusted models. Conclusions: Our results show that FGF23
   is associated with LVH but not with endothelial dysfunction, arterial
   stiffness, or vascular calcification in PD patients.}},

   Methods: This study included 71 patients who had previously undergone
   any revascularization procedure. All patients presented to the
   cardiology outpatient clinic with angina or angina equivalent and
   underwent coronary angiography upon findings of preliminary tests. The
   patients were grouped on the basis of the presence of restenosis on
   angiography: Group 1 consisted of 44 subjects with restenosis on
   angiography (30 male, 14 female; mean age 64.2 +/- 4.2 years) and group
   2; 30 subjects without restenosis on angiography (20 male, 10 female;
   61.2 +/- 13.1 years). In addition to routine biochemical tests and lipid
   panel, all patients underwent C-reactive protein, and fetuin-A
   measurements.
   Results: The groups were not significantly different with respect to
   age, sex, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. As compared to Group 2,
   Group 1 had a significantly lower fetuin-A level (383.8 +/- 76.2 vs.
   416.3 +/- 49.3 ng/mL; p = 0.029). There was a significantly negative

   the common iliac arteries and for the external iliac arteries. The
   operative and clinical notes were reviewed to determine which iliac
   arterial segment was used for anastomosis, the complexity of the
   operation, and whether delayed graft function (DGF) occurred. Renal
   allograft survival and patient survival were calculated using the
   Kaplan-Meier technique.
   RESULTS. Excellent interobserver agreement was noted for each
   calcification score category. The common iliac arteries showed
   significantly higher average calcification scores than the external
   iliac arteries for all categories. Advanced age and diabetes mellitus
   were independently predictive of higher scores in each category, whereas
   hypertension, cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, and sex were not. Based
   on multivariate analysis, only the calcification morphology score of the
   arterial segment used for anastomosis was independently predictive of a
   higher rate of surgical complexity and of DGF. None of the scores was
   predictive of graft or patient survival. However, patients with CT
   evidence of iliac arterial calcification had a lower 1-year survival
   after transplant than those who did not (92\% vs 98\%, respectively; p =
   0.05).
   CONCLUSION. Only the calcification morphology score of the arterial
   segment used for anastomosis was significantly predictive of surgical
   complexity and of DGF. Routine pretransplant CT for calcification
   scoring in patients of advanced age or those with diabetes mellitus may
   enable selection of the optimal artery for anastomosis to optimize
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose While it is well known that patients with chronic kidney disease
   (CKD) are at increased risk for the development and progression of
   atherosclerosis, it is not known whether arterial inflammation is
   increased in mild CKD. The aim of this study was to compare arterial
   inflammation using F-18-FDG PET/CT in patients with CKD and in matched
   controls.
   Methods This restrospective study included 128 patients undergoing FDG
   PET/CT imaging for clinical indications, comprising 64 patients with
   stage 3 CKD and 64 control patients matched by age, gender, and cancer
   history. CKD was defined according to guidelines using a calculated
   glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Arterial inflammation was measured in
   the ascending aorta as FDG uptake on PET. Background FDG uptake (venous,
   subcutaneous fat and muscle) were recorded. Coronary artery
   calcification (CAC) was assessed using the CT images. The impact of CKD
   on arterial inflammation and CAC was then assessed.
   Results Arterial inflammation was higher in patients with CKD than in
   matched controls (standardized uptake value, SUV: 2.41 +/- 0.49 vs. 2.16
   +/- 0.43; p=0.002). Arterial SUV correlated inversely with eGFR
   (r=-0.299, p=0.001). Venous SUV was also significantly elevated in
   patients with CKD, while subcutaneous fat and muscle tissue SUVs did not
   differ between groups. Moreover, arterial SUV remained significantly
   elevated in patients with CKD compared to controls after correcting for
   muscle and fat background, and also remained significant after adjusting
   for clinical risk factors. Further, CKD was associated with arterial
   inflammation (SUV) independent of the presence of subclinical
   atherosclerosis (CAC).
   Conclusion Moderate CKD is associated with increased arterial
   inflammation beyond that of controls. Further, the increased arterial
   inflammation is independent of presence of subclinical atherosclerosis.
   Current risk stratification tools may underestimate the presence of
   atherosclerosis in patients with CKD and thereby the risk of
   cardiovascular events.}},

Abstract = {{Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcification in the medium and small
   vessel arterioles and can be a life-threatening complication often
   associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A review of the literature
   was conducted to explore existing evidence about the relationship
   between obesity and calciphylaxis. A total of 54 publications (published
   between 1962 and 2015) were identified. Most studies noted a variety of
   risk factors for calciphylaxis, including CKD, female gender, Caucasian
   race, liver disease, and lower serum albumin. Obesity was identified as
   a risk factor in 6 of the 8 studies reviewed. In one study, obesity was
   found to increase the risk of calciphylaxis 4-fold. The majority of
   calciphylaxis lesions in obese persons were proximal in distribution;
   all studies report proximal lesions are associated with a higher
   mortality rate than distal lesions. The mortality rate of persons with
   CKD and calciphylaxis is 8 times higher than that of persons with CKD
   without calciphylaxis. There is no definitive evidence to support the
   belief current epidemic rates of obesity, diabetes, (diabesity), and
   chronic renal disease will predispose more patients to the development
   of calciphylaxis. However, until more information from the calciphylaxis
   registries and other studies is available, clinicians should maintain a
   high index of suspicion when a patient presents with indurated, painful
   nodules or necrotic ulcers, especially if the patient also has CKD.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Sclerostin is an osteocyte hormone that decreases
   osteoblastogenesis. Sclerostin may play a key role in osteoporosis and
   also in vascular calcification (VC). In chronic kidney disease and
   haemodialysis (HD) patients, serum sclerostin levels are high. Aim: To
   assess the correlation of serum sclerostin levels with VC, bone mineral
   density (BMD), and survival rate in HD patients. Methods: A
   cross-sectional study was conducted in prevalent HD patients to
   correlate serum sclerostin tertiles with the Kauppila aortic
   calcification score, BMD scores and survival rate. Results: We studied
   207 patients who had a mean serum sclerostin level of 1.9 +/- 0.7 ng/ml.
   Compared to patients in the 1st tertile of serum sclerostin levels
   (0.6-1.53 ng/ml), patients in the 3rd tertile (2.2-4.6 ng/ml) were
   significantly older (73.7 +/- 12 vs. 64.7 +/- 18 years), more frequently
   of the male gender (74 vs. 48\%), had lower serum bone-specific alkaline
   phosphatases values (14 +/- 9 vs. 20.4 +/- 13 mu g/l), were less
   frequently treated with alfacalcidol, displayed lower aortic
   calcification scores (9.5 +/- 5 vs. 12.5 +/- 7/24) and had higher BMD
   scores. Furthermore, patients of the 3rd tertile displayed a lower
   mortality rate compared to tertile 1 using multivariable adjusted Cox
   model (hazard ratio 0.5, 95\% CI 0.25-0.93, p = 0.03). The main factors
   associated with VC score were age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, CRP
   level and Warfarin use. Conclusion: Our study of HD patients shows that
   higher serum sclerostin levels are associated with higher BMD, lower
   aortic calcification scores, and a better survival rate. (C) 2016 S.

Abstract = {{Context: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in
   renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest
   that activated Wnt signaling contributes to VC.
   Objective: The objective was to investigate whether circulating levels
   of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with progression of VC.
   Design: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal observational
   Brussels Renal Transplant Cohort study.
   Setting: The setting was a tertiary care academic hospital.
   Patients: Coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification were
   measured by multislice spiral computerized tomography in 268 prevalent
   RTRs (age, 53 +/- 13 y; 61\% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189
   patients after a median follow-up of 4.4 years. Baseline serum
   sclerostin levels were assessed on stored blood samples. Regression
   analysis was performed to identify determinants of baseline VC and
   progression.
   Main outcome measure: The main outcome measure was progression of VC.
   Results: VC was present in up to 84\% of participants at baseline.
   Almost half of the patients showed progression of VC, according to
   Hokanson criteria. The cross-sectional analysis at baseline demonstrated
   a direct association between sclerostin levels and VC score in
   univariate analysis, which became inverse after adjustment for age,
   gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level was
   identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline aorta
   calcification score in the final regression model. Moreover, baseline
   sclerostin levels showed an inverse association with VC progression, at
   least after adjustment for traditional risk factors.
   Conclusions: Serum sclerostin levels inversely associated with VC burden
   and progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for traditional risk
   factors. Our data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted
   chronic kidney disease patients and support the notion that sclerostin
   may be up-regulated in the vascular wall during the VC process as part
   of a local counterregulatory mechanism directed to suppress VC.
   Additional clinical and experimental data are required for confirmation.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of bone tissue in calcified arteries may provide insights
   into the pathophysiology and potential reversibility of calcification,
   but the prevalence, distribution, and determinants of bone and
   osteoclasts in calcified arteries are unknown. Specimens of 386 arteries
   from lower limb amputations in 108 patients were examined
   retrospectively. Calcification was present in 282 arteries from 89
   patients, which was medial in 64\%, intimal in 9\%, and both in 27\%.
   Bone was present in 6\% of arteries, essentially all of which were
   heavily calcified. Multiple sampling revealed that the true prevalence
   of bone in heavily calcified arteries was 25\%. Bone was more common in
   medial rather than intimal calcifications (10\% vs 3\%, p=0.03) but did
   not vary with artery location (above vs below the knee). Heavily
   calcified arteries with bone were more likely to come from patients who
   were older (p=0.04), had diabetes (p=0.06), or were receiving warfarin
   (p=0.06), but there was no association with gender or renal failure.
   Bone was almost always adjacent to calcifications, along the periphery,
   but never within. Staining for the bone-specific proteins osteocalcin
   and osterix was noted in 20\% and 45\% of heavily calcified arteries
   without visible bone. Osteoclasts were present in 4.9\% of arteries, all
   of which were heavily calcified and most of which contained bone. The
   frequent absence of bone in heavily calcified vessels and the histologic
   pattern strongly suggests a secondary rather than primary event.
   Recruitment of osteoclasts to vascular calcifications can occur but is
   rare, suggesting a limited capacity to reverse calcifications.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: Vascular calcification independently predicts
   cardiovascular disease (CVD), and computed tomography (CT) is a useful
   tool to evaluate and quantify not only coronary but also thoracic aortic
   calcification (TAC). Previous TAC progression reports were limited to
   dialysis and renal transplant patients. This is the first study to
   evaluate TAC progression in a large multiethnic cohort without
   clinically evident CVD at entry.
   Methods: Non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CTs were obtained in 5886 of 6814
   Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants (mean age, 62
   years; 48\% males; 40\% white, 27\% black, 21\% Hispanic, and 12\%
   Chinese). Baseline and follow-up TAC scores were derived.
   Results: Overall, 4308 (73\%) participants had no detectable baseline
   TAC. Mean follow-up duration was 2.4 +/- 0.8 years, during which 12\%
   developed TAC. The overall incidence rate was 4.8\%/year and was greater
   with age across gender and ethnic groups; TAC incidence was
   significantly lower in blacks than whites. After adjustment for
   follow-up duration, regression analyses showed age, systolic blood
   pressure, antihypertensives, and smoking were associated with incident
   TAC. A total of 1578 (27\%) participants had TAC at baseline with a
   positive association between average annual TAC change and baseline age.
   Although the overall median change was 32.9 (-1.4 to 112.2) Agatston
   units, 27\% showed an annual score change of >= 100 and blacks showed
   the lowest median across ethnic groups; 22.7 (-3 to 86.8). Age, systolic
   blood pressure, lipid-lowering medication, diabetes, and smoking were
   associated with TAC progression.
   Conclusions: In MESA, traditional CV risk factors were related to both
   TAC incidence and progression. Blacks had the lowest incidence and
   median change across ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings
   for coronary calcification.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Vascular access (VA) dysfunction limits hemodialysis delivery,
   which increases morbidity and mortality. The most common cause of VA
   failure is thrombosis, due to flow limiting stenosis resulting from
   neointimal hyperplasia. This occurs not only due to hemodynamic factors
   but also by systemic ones related to vascular atherosclerosis,
   inflammation and calcification, which has developed a simple vascular
   calcification score (SVCS) predictor of vascular calcification and
   arterial stiffness. The NKF-K/DOQ recommends several diagnostic
   procedures for VA surveillance. Blood access flow (Qa) has predictive
   power for the detection of stenosis. Our aim was to evaluate the role of
   systemic factors, especially SCVS, on Qa. Material and methods:
   Transversal study in 50 patients. Qa value was obtained with Blood
   Temperature Monitor and Doppler method. Pearson coefficient evaluated
   correlation between them. Clinical, lab and radiological variables were
   recorded and non-parametric tests evaluated how both Qa varied with
   them. Results: Pearson's corelation between DU-Qa and TD-Qa was 0.851
   (p-value <0.001). DU-Qa varied significantly with age (p=0.012), VA type
   (p=0.021), SCVS (p=0.030), intra-access arterial pressure (p=0.015) and
   time on dialysis (p=0.002). BTM-Qa varied significantly with diabetes
   status (p=0.027), age (p=0.017), first VA status (p=0.036), intra-access
   arterial pressure (p=0.028) and dialysis time (p=0.001). Nevertheless,
   gender, hypertensive status and analitical parameters did not change the

   DU-Qas, giving this method an advantage towards the indirect one.
   Additionally, a simple method like SVCS may be used to guide new
   surveillance recommendations accordingly to risk stratification.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To investigate the usefulness of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23)
   and vitamin D as possible biomarkers of pre-clinical atherosclerosis,
   assessed as arterial stiffness (AS), in a group of subjects with type 1
   diabetes (T1DM) and no previous cardiovascular events.
   Research Design and Methods
   68 T1DM patients and 68 age-and sex-matched controls were evaluated for
   1) age, sex, diabetes duration, physical activity, smoking, alcohol
   intake, BMI, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, HbA(1c), estimated
   glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and lipid profile; 2) microvascular
   complications; 3) blood concentrations of FGF-23 and mineral metabolism
   parameters (calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and
   25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25 (OH)D)); 4) AS, assessed as aortic pulse wave
   velocity (aPWV); and 5) low-grade inflammation (hsCRP, IL-6, sTNF alpha
   R1, sTNF alpha R2) and endothelial dysfunction (ED) markers (ICAM-1,
   VCAM-1, E-Selectin).
   Results
   Patients with T1DM had higher aPWV compared with controls (rho<0.001),
   but they did not present differences in 25(OH)D (70.3(50.4-86.2) nmol/L
   vs. 70.7(59.7-83.0) nmol/L; rho = 0.462) and in FGF-23 plasma
   concentrations (70.1(38.4-151.9) RU/mL vs. 77.6(51.8-113.9) RU/mL; rho =
   0.329). In T1DM patients, higher concentrations of FGF-23 were
   positively associated with aPWV after adjusting for eGFR and classical
   cardiovascular risk factors (model 1: beta = 0.202, rho = 0.026), other
   mineral metabolism parameters (model 2: beta = 0.214, p = 0.015),
   microvascular complications, low-grade inflammation and ED markers
   (model 3: beta = 0.170, rho = 0.045). Lower 25(OH)D concentrations were
   also associated with higher aPWV after adjusting for all the
   above-mentioned factors (model 3: beta = -0.241, rho = 0.015).
   Conclusions
   We conclude that both FGF-23 plasma concentrations (positively) and
   25(OH)D serum concentrations (negatively) are associated with AS in
   patients with T1DM and no previous cardiovascular events.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Vascular calcification (VC) is known as an independent
   predictor of mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis;
   nevertheless, there is a lack of studies about the impact of vascular
   calcification in renal transplant recipients, and none of them use the
   Kauppila Index (KI) as a predictor of patient and graft prognosis.
   Methods. We conducted an observational, retrospective study of 119 renal
   transplants, evaluating abdominal aortic calcifications (L4-S1) with the
   KI. We established 2 categories: absence (KI = 0-2) and presence (KI =
   3-24) of VCs before transplantation. We analyzed the impact of
   calcification in graft and patient survival, new-onset diabetes
   mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular events, renal function, and
   mineral metabolism.
   Results. VCs were observed in 50 patients (42\%) before renal
   transplantation. Patients with VCs were older, but no statistical
   differences were found in the pre-transplant study between sex,
   diabetes, body mass index, and cardiovascular events. We found a major
   patient survival (limited to first 2 years after transplantation), graft
   survival, and death-censored graft survival in those without VCs (P =
   .037, P = .015, and P = .023, respectively). In line with results, a
   higher incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE) and
   cardiovascular death was observed in the group with preexisting
   calcification (P = .016/P = .019). In the multivariable analysis, VCs
   were not an independent predictor for graft loss, death-censored graft
   loss, or major cardiovascular events.
   Conclusions. Simple evaluation of VCs with the use of the KI at the time
   of transplantation relates with graft and patient survival and with MACE
   after renal transplantation.}},

Title = {{The relationship between proton pump inhibitor use and serum magnesium
   concentration among hemodialysis patients: a cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Observational data suggest that serum magnesium (Mg)
   concentration is inversely related to vascular calcification and
   hyperparathyroidism among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
   In recent years, there have been several case reports of hypomagnesemia
   due to use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), with the hypomagnesemia
   attributed to inappropriate gastrointestinal (GI) Mg loss. We
   hypothesized that the tendency to GI Mg loss is more common than is
   currently reported. Since patients with ESRD have little to no renal Mg
   loss to affect serum Mg concentration, dialysis patients are an
   interesting population in whom to study the relationship between PPI use
   and serum Mg levels.
   Methods: Using a single-center cross-sectional design, we studied 155
   prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum Mg concentration for each
   patient was determined based on the mean of 3 consecutive serum Mg
   levels drawn at 6 week intervals. PPI use at the time of the blood tests
   was documented. The relationship between PPI use and Mg concentration
   was determined in unadjusted analyses, as well as after adjustment for
   age, gender, race, cause of ESRD, diabetes, time on HD and dialysate Mg
   concentration.
   Results: 55 \% of patients were on PPIs at the time of the study. The
   majority of patients (62 \%) used a dialysate Mg (in mmol/L) of 0.5, and
   the remainder (38 \%) used a dialysate Mg of 0.375. Serum Mg levels were
   significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users (0.93 vs. 1.02 mmol/L,
   p < 0.001). This finding persisted after stratifying for dialysate Mg
   concentration, and after multivariable adjustment (p < 0.001). In
   addition, more PPI users vs. non-users had a Mg level < 1 mmol/L (79 \%
   vs. 43 \%) and a Mg level < 0.8 mmol/L (16 \% vs. 4 \%). There was a
   non-significant trend toward increased time on PPI being associated with
   lower serum Mg levels (p = 0.067).
   Conclusion: Among HD patients, PPI users have lower serum Mg levels as
   compared with non-users. Further research is required to determine
   whether the magnitude of change in Mg levels among PPI users is
   associated with adverse outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The cardiovascular risk factors that contribute to coronary
   calcification have been extensively studied while those related to
   tibial artery calcium are less well defined. We sought to determine the
   associations between cardiovascular risk factors and tibial artery
   calcification in a cohort of patients with and without significant
   peripheral atherosclerosis. A total of 222 patients without end-stage
   renal disease were identified in a prospectively maintained database
   containing tibial artery calcification (TAC) scores, and demographic,
   cardiovascular, and biochemical risk factor information. Patients with
   prevalent tibial artery calcification were more likely to be older,
   male, and have a history positive for hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   diabetes, and tobacco use. Patients with an abnormal ankle-brachial
   index (ABI) or symptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) were also
   more likely to have higher calcium values. In analyses using
   multivariable logistic regression, age, gender, diabetes, and tobacco
   use maintained their association with prevalent tibial calcification
   while hypertension, hyperlipidemia and body mass index did not. These
   associations remained when PAD was added to the model. After adjusting
   for relevant cardiovascular risk factors, we found that only abnormal
   ABI, current PAD symptoms, and lower serum calcium values were
   associated with the presence of tibial artery calcification. In
   conclusion, in patients without end-stage renal disease, tibial artery
   calcification has risk factors that are similar but not identical to
   those for coronary artery calcification and peripheral atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), sclerostin and DKK1 constitute
   opposite bone turnover inhibitors, OPG inhibiting osteoclastogenesis
   while sclerostin and DKK1 exerting their inhibitory effects on
   osteoblastogenesis. Both proteins have been recognized as strong risk
   factors of vascular calcifications in non-dialysis chronic kidney
   disease (ND-CKD) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   relationships between these inhibitors and coronary artery
   calcifications (CAC) in this population.
   Methods. A total of 241 ND-CKD patients {[}143 males; 69.0 (25.0-95.0)
   years; median estimated glomerular filtration rate using CKD-EPI 35.1
   (6.7-120.1) mL/min/1.73 m(2)] were enrolled in this cross-sectional
   study. All underwent chest multidetector computed tomography for CAC
   scoring. OPG, sclerostin, DKK1 and mineral metabolism markers including
   PTH and bone alkaline phosphatase were measured. Logistic regression
   analyses were used to study the relationships between CAC and these
   markers.
   Results. Decline in renal function was associated with a significant
   increase in OPG and sclerostin while a slight but significant decrease
   in DKK1 was observed. The main crude associations with presence of CAC
   were a high level of OPG {[}OR = 2.55 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI)

   95\% CI (2.87-11.5) for a level >= 9.15 pmol/L; P < 0.0001] and a high
   level of sclerostin {[}OR = 2.64 95\% CI (1.39-5.00) for a level ranging
   from 0.748 to 1.139 ng/mL and OR = 3.78 95\% CI (1.96-7.31) for a level
   >= 1.139 ng/mL; P = 0.0002]. A logistic regression model clearly showed
   that the risk to present CAC was significantly increased when both OPG
   (>= 6.26 pmol/L) and sclerostin (>= 0.748 ng/mL) levels were high
   {[}crude model: OR = 11.47 95\% CI (4.54-29.0); P < 0.0001; model

   OR = 5.69 95\% CI (1.76-18.4); P = 0.02]. No association between DKK1
   and presence of CAC was observed.
   Conclusions. Our results strongly suggest that bone turnover inhibitors,

Abstract = {{BackgroundResearch has identified associations between serum 25(OH)D and
   a range of clinical outcomes in chronic kidney disease and wider
   populations. The present study aimed to investigate vitamin D
   deficiency/insufficiency in dialysis patients and the relationship with
   vitamin D intake and sun exposure.
   MethodsA cross-sectional study was used. Participants included 30
   peritoneal dialysis (PD) (43.3\% male; 56.8716.16years) and 26
   haemodialysis (HD) (80.8\% male; 63.5815.09years) patients attending a
   department of renal medicine. Explanatory variables were usual vitamin D
   intake from diet/supplements (IUday(-1)) and sun exposure (minday(-1)).
   Vitamin D intake, sun exposure and ethnic background were assessed by
   questionnaire. Weight, malnutrition status and routine biochemistry were
   also assessed. Data were collected during usual department visits. The
   main outcome measure was serum 25(OH)D (nm).
   ResultsPrevalence of inadequate/insufficient vitamin D intake differed
   between dialysis modality, with 31\% and 43\% found to be insufficient
   (<50nm) and 4\% and 33\% found to be deficient (<25nm) in HD and PD
   patients, respectively (P<0.001). In HD patients, there was a
   correlation between diet and supplemental vitamin D intake and 25(OH)D
   (=0.84, P<0.001) and average sun exposure and 25(OH)D (=0.50, P<0.02).
   There were no associations in PD patients. The results remained
   significant for vitamin D intake after multiple regression, adjusting
   for age, gender and sun exposure.
   ConclusionsThe results highlight a strong association between vitamin D
   intake and 25(OH)D in HD but not PD patients, with implications for
   replacement recommendations. The findings indicate that, even in a sunny
   climate, many dialysis patients are vitamin D deficient, highlighting
   the need for exploration of determinants and consequences.}},

   systemic arteriosclerosis. In our study, we aimed to investigate. the
   association between proteinuria and graft/patient survival and to
   determine whether proteinuria may be a predictor for cardiovascular
   disease in our KTR population.
   Methods. Ninety KTRs (31 women; age, 38.7 +/- 11 years, with 45.9 +/-
   9.6 months post-transplantation period) with normal graft functions in
   the 3 to 5 years of the post-transplantation period were enrolled. All
   patients were evaluated for their standard clinical (age, sex, and
   duration of hemodialysis) parameters. High-grade proteinuria was defined
   as proteinuria >500 mg/day in the 24-hour urine collection. All patients
   were evaluated by means of pulse-wave velocity (PWV) measurement at the
   initiation of the study.
   Results. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 (high-grade
   proteinuria) patients with >= 500 mg/24 hours (n = 30) and group 2
   (low-grade proteinuria) patients with <500 mg/24 hours (n = 60).
   High-grade proteinuria was correlated with higher PWV measurements and
   lower estimated glomerular filtration levels. Proteinuria appears to
   precede the elevation of serum creatinine and thus may be a useful
   marker of renal injury and may also be a contributing factor on
   deterioration of the graft.
   Conclusions. High-grade (>500 mg/day) proteinuria in KTRs is strongly
   associated with poor graft survival and increased risk of cardiovascular
   events. In our study, we proved the significant difference between
   high-grade and low-grade proteinuric patients, and we suggest 500 mg/day
   as the threshold of proteinuria in KTR population.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex
   syndrome influenced by various factors, such as age, CKD etiology,
   uremic toxins, and dialysis modality. Although extensively studied in
   hemodialysis (HD) patients, only a few studies exist for peritoneal
   dialysis (PD) patients. Since most of these older studies contain no
   bone biopsy data, we studied the pattern of renal osteodystrophy in 41
   prevalent PD patients. The most common presentation was adynamic bone
   disease (49\%). There was a significant inverse association between
   serum sclerostin (a Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitor that decreases
   osteoblast action and bone formation) and the bone formation rate. Bone
   alkaline phosphatase had the best sensitivity and specificity to detect
   both high-and low-turnover diseases. The comparison between nondiabetic
   PD and HD patients, matched by age, gender, parathyroid hormone level,
   and length of dialysis, revealed low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, worse
   bone mineralization, and low bone turnover in the nondiabetic PD group.
   Thus, adynamic bone disease was the most frequent type of renal
   osteodystrophy in PD patients. Sclerostin seems to participate in the
   pathophysiology of adynamic bone disease and bone alkaline phosphatase
   was the best serum marker of bone turnover in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the cardiovascular disease risk and mortality in
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. A total of 12,535 patients with
   ESRD undergoing incident dialysis were enrolled, 4,153 (33.13 \%) of

   significantly higher risk of coronary artery disease, congestive heart
   failure, stroke, and mortality.
   In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk of cardiovascular
   disease and mortality in a sample of end-stage renal disease patients
   with osteoporosis.
   We conducted this retrospective cohort study of incident dialysis
   patients with and without osteoporosis to evaluate the risk of overall
   mortality and cardiovascular complications including stroke, coronary
   heart disease, and congestive heart failure between the two groups. A
   total of 12,535 patients with ESRD undergoing incident dialysis were
   enrolled, 4,153 (33.13 \%) of whom had osteoporosis, from the National
   Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan for the years 1998 through
   2011. The osteoporosis group had more comorbidities than the group
   without osteoporosis including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, mental
   disorders, and hepatitis C infection.
   After adjusting for age, gender, and related comorbidities, the
   osteoporosis group was associated with a significantly higher risk of
   coronary artery disease (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32, 95 \% confidence
   interval (CI) = 1.20-1.45) which was significant in both genders (women,
   HR = 1.35, 95 \% CI = 1.20-1.50; men HR = 1.27, 95 \% CI = 1.06-1.52)

   Similar results were observed for the outcomes of congestive heart
   failure, stroke, and mortality.
   The results showed that osteoporosis was significantly associated with
   the subsequent risk of cardiovascular events in patients with ESRD. When
   encountering patients with ESRD and osteoporosis, physicians should be
   alert to the subsequent cardiovascular risk in incident dialysis
   patients to prevent the subsequent occurrence of these adverse events.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of serum
   25-hydroxyvitamin D level with vascular calcification in patients
   treated with hemodialysis. Methods: As a cross-sectional study, 126
   patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) in our hospital were
   enrolled in this study. According to the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
   level, the patients were divided into 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency
   group (30 eta g/ml or less than 30 eta g/ml) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D
   normal level group (>30 eta g/ml). All of the subjects underwent lateral
   lumbar, pelvis and hands X-ray examination to score the degree of
   calcification (Kauppila score). Results: Among the 126 patients treated
   with MHD, there were 110 patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency
   and 16 patients with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. There was no
   significant difference found in gender, age, age of dialysis, active
   vitamin D treatment, blood calcium, blood phosphorus, blood parathyroid
   hormone (PTH) and other related indicators between the two groups. The
   incidence of vascular calcification in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D
   deficiency was significantly higher than that in patients with normal
   25-hydroxyvitamin D level (P = 0.001). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level
   had a negative correlation with the calcification score (r = 0.193, P =
   0.193). Logistic regression showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not a
   risk factor for vascular calcification in MHD patients. Serum
   25-hydroxyvitamin D level is generally low in patients with MHD.
   Conclusions: Patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency have a higher
   incidence of vascular calcification with a markedly negative
   correlation. Thus, for the patients treated with MHD, vitamin D
   deficiency should be actively treated.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The cause of early-accelerated atherosclerosis development
   observed in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is not fully understood. The
   determination of the relationship between the levels of fibroblast
   growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and the development of endothelial
   dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, and myocardial infarction
   lends support to the possibility that FGF-23 plays a role in the
   development of atherosclerosis in CKD. Only a few studies, however, have
   been conducted that analyze the relationship between FGF-23 levels in
   the progression of CKD and the development of atherosclerosis, and these
   studies have generally been limited to those patients receiving dialysis
   therapy due to end stage renal disease (ESRD).
   Methods: In the present study, carotid artery intima-media thicknesses
   (IMT) were measured ultrasonically as a marker of atherosclerosis in 91
   patients with CKD stage 3 - 4 (61 female and 30 male, age between 19 -
   65 years, glomerular filtration rate {[}GFR] 15 - 60 mL/min 1.73 m(2),
   CKD was not related to diabetes mellitus, and without
   cardiovascular-cerebral disease) in contrast to 36 healthy volunteers
   (26 female and 10 male, age between 19 - 65 years, GFR > 90 mL/min 1.73
   m(2), and without any diagnoses of acute or chronic disease), and a
   possible role of FGF-23 on atherosclerosis was analyzed.
   Results: Patients were similar to controls with respect to age, gender,
   smoking status, body mass index, and plasma glucose and lipid profile.
   On the other hand, IMT measurements (p < 0.00001) and FGF-23 levels (p =
   0.00012) were significantly higher in patients than controls. IMT was
   measured above the subclinical atherosclerosis limit of 0.750 mm in 54\%
   of the patients. Multivariate regression analysis showed that patients'
   age, high sensitive c-reactive protein (hsCRP), and FGF-23 levels were
   independent predictors of IMT (p < 0.00001, r = 0.559). Independent of
   other variables, every 1 mu mol/L increase in FGF-23 levels resulted in
   0.444 mm increase of IMT measurements in patients with CKD.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that monitoring serum FGF-23 may be
   useful as a non-invasive indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis in
   patients with chronic kidney disease.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. To analyze changes in the serum concentrations of the morphogenetic
   proteins fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and Klotho, as well as
   sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted glycoprotein, in relation to the
   degree of hypertension, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and arterial
   stiffness in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) at its different
   stages. Subjects and methods: Sixty-five patients (33 men and 32 women)
   aged 20-65 years, including 25 with chronic glomerulonephritis, 15 with
   tubulointerstitial nephritis, and 25 with hypertensive nephrosclerosis,
   were examined. A control group consisted of 15 healthy volunteers
   matched to the study group patients for age and gender. Serum FGF-23
   concentrations and blood pressure (BP) were measured in the all
   subjects. Patients with BPs > 140/80 mm Hg underwent echocardiography,
   followed by determination of LV mass (LVM) and calculation of LVM index.
   Vascular circulation, pulse wave velocity, cardiac and vascular
   calcifications, and vascular functional properties were estimated.
   Results. There was a strong direct correlation between the serum
   concentration of FGF-23 and the stage of CKD and an inverse correlation
   between the levels of Klotho and sclerostin and the stage of CKD. As the
   glomerular filtration rate became lower, the concentration of FGF-23
   increased and that of Klotho and sclerostin decreased just in Stage III
   CKD while hyperphosphatemia and elevated parathyroid hormone levels were
   noted in Stages IV-V CKD. As CKD progressed, the serum concentrations of
   Klotho and sclerostin were inversely correlated with the levels of
   phosphorus and parathyroid hormone. The degree of blood pressure
   elevation correlated positively with serum FGF-23 concentrations and
   inversely with Klotho levels. There was no significant correlation of
   the level of sclerostin with the degree of BP increase. The direct
   correlation between higher FGF-23 level and higher VLM is most
   pronounced in hypertensive patients. There was a strong direct
   relationship between FGF-23 and Klotho levels and a strong inverse
   relationship between sclerostin levels and pulse wave velocity. Lower
   Klotho concentrations were associated with the detection rate of
   calcifications in the heart valves and large arteries (the abdominal
   aorta). The reduced serum levels of Klotho and sclerostin were also
   correlated with concentric LV remodeling.
   Conclusion. It was demonstrated that there was a clear link between
   increased serum FGF-23 and decreased Klotho concentration as CKD
   progressed, and that between arterial stiffness and calcification and
   myocardial remodelling regardless of traditional risk factors. More
   experimental and clinical studies are required to clarify the role of
   sclerostin in CKD.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have significant
   disorders of bone and mineral metabolism. In addition, they can also
   develop other bone disorders including osteoporosis. This study
   evaluated the bone mineral density (BMD) of patients at the start of
   hemodialysis treatment as well as the relationship between BMD and
   possible risk factors or biochemical markers.
   Methods. The study was performed in 82 patients (28 females, 54 males).
   BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar
   spine and the proximal femur.
   Results. We found a high prevalence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency
   (96\%; mean levels 30.0 +/- 17.7 nmol/L) and a reduction of BMD in
   comparison with gender-and age-matched normal population values at the
   total hip (Z-score = -0.31 +/- 1.11) and the femoral neck (Z-score =
   -0.48 +/- 1.16), but not at the lumbar spine (Z-score = 0.68 +/- 1.81).
   The prevalence of T-scores = -2.5 SD in the group of patients over 50
   years was 52.0\% in females and 33.3\% in males. BMD positively
   correlated: with male gender and calcium levels at all measured sites,
   with age at the lumbar spine and with weight or BMI at the proximal
   femur.
   Conclusion. CKD patients at the start of hemodialysis treatment had a
   high prevalence of low T-score values, corresponding to values for
   osteoporosis in the general population. BMD at the proximal femur was
   below the expected average for age and gender, but at the lumbar spine,
   BMD in hemodialysis patients was above average in persons without known
   CKD.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a secreted glycoprotein in the
   regulation of bone turnover. Recently, many studies showed that OPG acts
   as an important regulatory molecule in the vascular systems. Our
   objective was to examine the plasma OPG levels alteration and its
   association with endothelial function before and after hypouricemic
   therapy in patients with hyperuricemia.
   Methods. Thirty patients (28 males and 2 females, serum uric acid > 7.0
   mg/dl) with hyperuricemia were selected. Thirty healthy individuals (28
   males and 2 females) with normal serum uric acid were also selected as
   control. Patients were administered with hypouricemic therapy for 6
   months. Plasma OPG concentration was measured in duplicate using a
   sandwich ELISA and high-resolution ultrasound was used to measure
   brachial artery diameter at rest, after reactive hyperemia and after
   sublingual glyceryltrinitrate.
   Results. Plasma OPG levels in patients with hyperuricemia before
   hypouricemic therapy was significantly higher than those in controls
   (3.39 +/- 0.25 vs. 2.05 +/- 0.74 ng/L, p < 0.01). After hypouricemic
   therapy, OPG levels decreased markedly (2.54 +/- 0.38 ng/L, p < 0.01).
   Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in patients with hyperuricemia was 3.07 +/-
   1. 23\%, which was significantly lower than that in control subjects
   (4.62 +/- 0.69\%, p < 0.01), and it improved significantly after
   hypouricemic therapy (3.91 +/- 1.37\%, p < 0.01). The absolute changes
   in OPG showed a significant positive correlation with the changes in
   serum uric acid (p < 0.05) and negative correlation with the changes in
   FMD (p < 0.01) in patients with hyperuricemia during the course of
   hypouricemic therapy.
   Conclusion. The current study demonstrates that plasma OPG levels
   increased significantly in patients with hyperuricemia and decreased
   significantly after hypouricemic therapy, and are correlated with FMD.
   These findings support the growing concept that elevated plasma OPG
   levels may be involved with the development of endothelial dysfunction
   in patients with hyperuricemia.}},

Abstract = {{Warfarin inhibits vitamin-K dependent proteins involved in bone
   mineralization and the prevention of vascular calcification (bone Gla
   protein BGP, matrix Gla protein MGP). In this multi-center,
   cross-sectional study with 3-year follow-up, data from 387 patients on
   hemodialysis for >= 1 year at 18 dialysis units were analyzed. Patients
   on warfarin treatment for >1 year (11.9\% of the population) were
   compared with the remaining cohort for vertebral fractures, vascular
   calcifications and mortality. Vertebral fractures and vascular
   calcifications were sought in L-L vertebral X-rays (D5 to L4).
   Compared with controls, warfarin-treated male patients had more
   vertebral fractures (77.8 vs. 57.7\%, p<0.04), but not females (42.1\%
   vs. 48.4\%, p=0.6); total BGP was significantly reduced (82.35 vs. 202
   mu g/L, p<0.0001), with lower levels in treated men (69.5 vs. women
   117.0 mu g/L, p=0.03). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the
   use of warfarin was associated with increased odds of aortic (OR 2.58,
   p<0.001) and iliac calcifications (OR 2.86, p<0.001); identified
   confounders were age, atrial fibrillation, angina, PPI use and total
   BGP. Seventy-seven patients died during a 2.7 +/- 0.5 year follow-up. In
   univariate Cox regression analysis, patients on warfarin had a higher
   risk of all-cause mortality (HR 2.42, 95\% CI 1.42-4.16, p=0.001) when
   compared with those untreated and data adjustment for confounders
   attenuated but confirmed the significant warfarin-mortality link (HR:
   1.97, 95\% CI: 1.02-3.84, P=0.046).
   In hemodialysis patients, additional studies are warranted to verify the
   risk/benefit ratio of warfarin, which appears to be associated with
   significant morbidity and increased mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Vascular calcifications are frequently found among
   dialysis patients, and the calcification process may influence the
   patient's outcome. The aim of the present study was to determine the
   role that vascular calcifications may have on autologous arteriovenous
   fistula (AVF) survival. Methods: This study included 90 patients (49
   males, mean age 62 +/- 11) with a native AVF treated by chronic
   hemodialysis (HD) for more than one year. The overall vascular
   calcification scores ranged from 0-11 (Adragao score + vascular access
   calcification score); patients were categorized into mild (score 0-3; n
   = 36), moderate (score 4-7; n = 24) and severe (score 8-11; n = 30)
   calcification groups. AVF survival was then followed for 5 years after
   calcification measurement or until the patient's death/transplantation.
   Results: Patients with more pronounced vascular calcifications were more
   frequently diabetic and male. Multiple linear regression analysis showed
   a significant relationship between cal-cification score and male gender,
   diabetes mellitus, previous duration of AVF, low dialysis flow rate and
   intact parathormone (iPTH) values. After multivariate adjustment for
   basal differences, Cox proportional analysis revealed a graded impact of
   calcification scores on AVF failure: moderate scores (were associated
   with a hazard rate (HR) of 3.82 (95\% confidence interval (CI)
   1.10-13.23) and severe scores with an HR of 4.65 (CI 0.97-22.38).

Abstract = {{Background: Sclerostin (Scl) has recently emerged as a novel marker of

   events kidney transplant and death.
   Results: Ninety-one patients aged 42.3 +/- 18.8 years (55\% of male
   gender, 15\% of diabetes) were included. During the follow-up, 32
   patients underwent kidney transplant and 26 patients died. Non-survivals

Abstract = {{Background: Cardiovascular events (CVE) are more prevalent in chronic
   kidney disease (CKD) than in general population, being the main cause of
   morbimortality. Specific risk factors related to CKD have been
   suggested, because traditional factors do not fully explain this
   increase in cardiovascular disease rates. However, the role of
   atheromatosis, its pathogenesis and evolution are still unclear. The
   potential use of diagnostic tests to detect subclinical atheromatosis
   has to be determined.
   Methods: NEFRONA is a prospective multicenter cohort study. 2445 CKD
   subjects were enrolled from 81 Spanish hospitals and dialysis clinics,
   from 2010 to 2012. Eligibility criteria included: 18 to 74 years old,
   CKD stage 3 or higher, and no previous CVE. 559 non-CKD controls were
   also recruited. Demographical, clinical and analytical data were
   collected. Carotid and femoral ultrasounds were performed by a single
   trained team to measure carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and detect
   atheromatous plaques. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured.
   Results: Differences in age, sex and prevalence and control of
   cardiovascular risk factors were found between controls and CKD
   patients. These differences are similar to those described in
   epidemiological studies. No difference was found regarding cIMT between
   controls and CKD (when subjects with plaques in common carotid arteries
   were omitted); earlier CKD stages had higher values. CKD patients had a
   higher rate of atheromatous plaques, with no difference between stages
   in the unadjusted analysis. A group of patients had plaques in femoral
   arteries but were plaque-free in carotid arteries, and would have gone
   underdiagnosed without the femoral study. The percentage of pathologic
   ABI was higher in CKD, with higher prevalence in more advanced stages,
   and a higher rate of ABI > 1.4 than <0.9, suggesting more vascular
   calcification.
   Conclusions: NEFRONA is the first large study describing the actual
   prevalence of subclinical atheromatosis across different CKD stages.
   There is a very high rate of atheromatous plaques and pathologic ABI in
   CKD. Prospective data will add important information to the pathogenesis
   and evolution of atheromatosis in CKD, compared to non-CKD subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The chronic kidney disease (CKD)-mineral and bone disorder
   (MBD) syndrome is an important contributor to the CKD-associated
   cardiovascular disease and high mortality rates. Sclerostin, a protein
   synthesized in osteocytes, is a potent downregulator of bone metabolism
   and a novel candidate for the bone-vascular axis in CKD patients. We
   tested whether serum sclerostin values are predictive for all-cause
   mortality and cardiovascular events (CVEs) in a CKD population.
   Methods: Serum sclerostin was obtained from 173 CKD (stage 3-5) and 47
   control patients, and its concentration was correlated with estimated
   glomerular filtration rate and to mineral and vascular abnormalities
   that are present in the CKD evolution. All-cause mortality and CVEs were
   also analyzed in relation to serum sclerostin values.
   Results: Patients with CKD showed higher sclerostin levels (median 63.5
   pmol/L vs 52 pmol/L, P .001) than controls, with values progressively
   higher across the CKD stages. In univariate analysis, serum sclerostin
   concentrations were correlated with gender, estimated glomerular
   filtration rate, flow-mediated dilatation, and endothelium-independent
   vasodilatation as markers of endothelial dysfunction and with different
   serum CKD-MBD-associated parameters. However, in multivariate analysis,
   only gender, fibroblast growth factor-23, phosphate, flow-mediated
   dilatation, and cholesterol remained significantly associated with
   sclerostin levels. During the observational period, there were 19 deaths
   and 50 CVEs. In survival analysis, different sclerostin levels were
   associated with all-cause mortality and CVEs in these patients.
   Conclusions: This is the first study that shows that serum sclerostin
   values are associated, even after multiple adjustments, with fatal and
   nonfatal CVEs in a nondialyzed CKD population.}},

   calcification in the three different arterial locations and the
   intramural location at the internal carotid artery (ICA) origins.
   Calcified burdens at the ICA origins, the aortic arch, and its orifices

   angiography in 397 patients. The multivariate analyses were adjusted for
   age, gender, CKD, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and current smoking
   status. Additionally, subgroup analyses in each variable were conducted.
   Our multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that CKD was
   significantly associated with the outside-wall calcification at the ICA
   origins, whereas DM was only associated with the inside-ICA-wall
   calcification. Additionally, we found that DM increased the association
   between CKD and arterial calcification at the aortic arch and its
   orifices, and the outside-wall at the ICA origins. Hypertension was
   significantly associated with the calcification at the orifices of the
   aortic arch branches synergistically with CKD. Dyslipidemia did not have
   any significant association with calcification in any of the three
   vascular beds. CKD had the highest prevalence risk of calcification in
   common with the three different vascular beds. CKD in combination with

   Computed tomography with contrast medium was performed on 49 patients

   A 11.0 years). A calcification score (CS) was defined as the ratio of
   the volume of vascular calcification to the volume of the thoracic
   aorta. All patients were monitored for cardiovascular end points, which
   included cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, myocardial infarction,
   electrocardiographic, or echocardiographic abnormalities that suggested
   myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery, leg amputation, and
   hospitalization or death due to heart failure.
   Patients were followed for 3 years, with 12 patients reaching the end

Abstract = {{Aim
   Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney
   disease (CKD) on dialysis, and an inverse relationship of VC to bone
   mineral density (BMD) has been reported. Because elderly patients are
   prone to atherosclerosis and BMD artefact, we examined the prevalence
   and epidemiology of VC in younger patients undergoing transplantation,
   and its relationship to BMD.
   Methods
   Laboratory testing was performed immediately before kidney or
   simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. Within 4 weeks
   patients underwent BMD evaluation and lateral abdominal X-ray. Aortic
   calcification was scored using a validated 24-point scale.
   Results
   Of 650 consecutive patients X-rays were available for 531 (82\%). Their
   median age was 41 years (16-71), 58\% were male, dialysis vintage was 20
   months (0-402) and 69\% had kidney and 31\% SPK transplants. VC scores
   were >= 1 in 47\%, with the median score 6 (1-24) and was associated
   with age, dialysis vintage and presence of cardiovascular,
   cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. In a multivariate
   analysis of patients with and without VC, those with VC were older and
   of longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.07 and 1.17 per 12 months respectively;
   P < 0.001 for both). In that analysis, VC was not significantly
   associated with gender, transplant type, presence of diabetes, current
   or former smoking or calcium or calcitriol therapy, and was not
   inversely related to hip, spine or forearm BMD Z-scores.
   Conclusion
   VC is common in younger patients undergoing transplantation and, similar
   to older patients, is associated with age, dialysis vintage and
   cardiovascular pathology. However, in this younger patient group, there
   was no significant inverse association of VC to BMD.}},

Abstract = {{Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is associated with increased
   mortality in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD), but the
   pathogenesis of this condition is not well understood. We evaluated the
   relationship of CAC score (CACs) and variability in serum phosphorus in
   MHD patients. Seventy-seven adults on MHD at Huashan Hospital (Shanghai)
   were enrolled in July, 2010. CAC of all the patients were measured by
   computed tomography and CACs was calculated by the Agatston method at
   the entry of enrollment. Patients were divided into three categories
   according to their CACs (0 similar to 10, 11 similar to 400, and >400).
   Blood chemistry was recorded every 3 months from January 2008 to July
   2010. Phosphorus variation was defined by the standard deviation (SD) or
   coefficient of variation (CV) and it was calculated from the past
   records. The ordinal multivariate logistic regression analysis was used
   to analyze the predictors of CAC. The mean patient age (+/- SD) was 61.7
   years (+/- 11.3) and 51\% of patients were men. The mean CACs was 609.6
   (+/- 1062.9), the median CACs was 168.5, and 78\% of patients had CACs
   more than 0. Multivariate analysis indicated that female gender (OR =
   0.20, 95\% CI = 0.07-0.55), age (OR = 2.31, 95\% CI = 1.32-4.04), serum
   fibroblast growth factor 23 (OR = 2.25, 95\% CI = 1.31-3.85),
   SD-phosphorus calculated from the most recent 6 measurements (OR = 2.12;
   95\% CI = 1.23-3.63), and CV-phosphorus calculated from the most recent
   6 measurements (OR = 1.90, 95\% CI = 1.16-3.11) were significantly and
   independently associated with CACs. These associations persisted for
   phosphorus variation calculated from past 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 follow-up
   values. Variability of serum phosphorus may contribute significantly to
   CAC and keeping serum phosphorus stable may decrease coronary
   calcification and associated morbidity and mortality in MHD patients.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{AimVascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic
   kidney disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and
   CKD-related risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension
   and phosphate retention. Kidney transplantation improves kidney function
   and abnormal mineral metabolism at the same time. It remains unclear
   whether kidney transplantation favourably impacts VC in the long-term.
   MethodsThe present study examined VC in 132 kidney transplant (KT)
   recipients who had been transplanted for longer than one year. The
   severity of VC was compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney
   transplant (KT) waiting list.
   ResultsThe median KT vintage was 88 months. The prevalence of VC among
   KT and CKD patients were 54.5\% and 62.8\%, respectively, (P=0.2). There
   were no differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the
   prevalence of DM or CVD between the two groups. Among patients with
   calcification, a more severe degree was observed in KT recipients
   (P=0.01). Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage were associated with
   significant VC in both groups. The degree of VC in KT recipients was
   more pronounced than that in CKD patients among those who experienced
   prolonged dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P=0.04). Among KT recipients, the
   severity of VC increased with the length of time after transplantation
   and became more substantial after 5 years.
   ConclusionsLong-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe degree of
   VC compared to matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC
   became more pronounced among those with longer transplant vintage and
   was in part influenced by past dialysis experience.
   Summary at a Glance This study assesses vascular calcification (VC) in
   kidney transplant recipients and matched patients on dialysis. Not
   surprisingly, prevalence and determinants of VC were similar for both
   groups. Of interest, VC severity was greater in transplant patients than
   in patients on dialysis. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm
   these data.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients undergoing maintenance dialysis are at increased
   risk of stroke.
   Study Design: We performed a nationwide retrospective cohort study to
   determine the risks for ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke among
   incident hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in
   comparison to a reference group in Taiwan.
   Setting \& Participants: Data for 74,192 HD patients, 5,974 PD patients,
   and 669,773 nondialysis individuals who were older than 18 years and had
   no history of stroke or cancer were retrieved from the National Health
   Insurance Research Database for 1998-2009.
   Predictors: Patient demographics, comorbid conditions.
   Outcome: First hospitalization for stroke, defined as a diagnosis at
   discharge (either primary or 1 of 4 secondary diagnoses) of ischemic or
   hemorrhagic stroke using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
   Revision, Clinical Modification codes.
   Results: HD and PD patients had higher incidences of hospitalized
   ischemic stroke (102.6 and 100.1/10,000 person-years) and hemorrhagic
   stroke (74.7 and 59.4/10,000 person-years) in comparison to the age-and
   sex-matched reference cohort (42.4 and 13.0/10,000 person-years,
   respectively). In addition to HD and PD therapy, older age, male sex,
   diabetes, and hypertension were found to be independent risk factors for
   both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Using the HD group as the
   comparison group, we found that PD patients had a lower risk of
   hemorrhagic stroke (HR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.58-0.96), and there was no
   significant difference in risks of ischemic stroke between PD and HD
   patients after adjusting for all potential confounders and competing
   risk of death, and matched by propensity scores.
   Limitations: This was a retrospective study, and some important
   variables were not available.
   Conclusions: Patients undergoing dialysis are at elevated risk of
   stroke. Patients undergoing PD appear to be less likely to develop
   hemorrhagic stroke than those undergoing HD. Comprehensive control of
   hypertension and diabetes is necessary when delivering dialysis
   treatment. (C) 2014 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Children receiving maintenance dialysis exhibit high
   cardiovascular (CV) associated mortality. We and others have shown high
   prevalence of cardiac calcifications (CC) in children with end-stage
   renal disease (ESRD). However, no pediatric study has examined modality
   difference in CC prevalence. The current study was conducted to assess
   for a difference in CC prevalence between hemodialysis (HD) and
   peritoneal dialysis (PD) in children with ESRD. Methods: 38 patients (19
   female, 19 male; mean age 15.5 +/- 4.1 years) receiving dialysis (21 HD,
   17 PD) were included in the study. CC were assessed by ultrafast gated
   CT and quantified by Agatston score. Patients received thrice weekly HD
   for 3 - 3.5 hours or daily continuous cycler PD (CCPD). FGF 23, IL-6,
   IL-8, and CRP levels were obtained at time of CT. Time-averaged (6
   months prior to CT) serum Ca, P, Alb, iPTH, and cholesterol levels were
   obtained. Patients on aspirin, with evidence of infection, underlying
   collagen vascular disease were excluded. Results: CC were present in
   11/38 patients, but more prevalent in HD vs. PD (9/21 vs. 2/17, p =
   0.04). Subjects with CC were older (p = 0.0003), had longer dialysis
   vintage (p = 0.02) and higher serum phosphorus (p = 0.02) and FGF 23
   levels (p = 0.03). HD patients also had significantly higher phosphorus
   (p = 0.02), FGF 23 (p = 0.009), and IL-8 levels (p = 0.02) when compared
   to PD patients. Residual renal function was not different between
   modalities or patients with CC. On a multinomial regression model,
   modality, and age remained independent associations for CC prevalence.
   Conclusion: We have shown that pediatric patients receiving CCPD have
   lower CC prevalence conferring lower CV risk. The better control of
   mineral imbalance in patients receiving PD may play an important role in
   lower CC prevalence.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of increasing the dialysate calcium concentration
   (DCa) to 1.75 mmol/L on controlling chronic kidney disease-mineral and
   bone disorder in Chinese patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). We
   reviewed the data of MHD patients in one center (cohort 1) during prior
   10 years and analyzed the risk factors of mortality and transference
   calcification (TC) in120 MHD patients surviving in 2003 (cohort 2). A
   multicenter, prospective, parallel-group, controlled trial (cohort 3)
   was also conducted from January 2011 to December 2012. The DCa at one
   center was increased from 1.5 to 1.75 mmol/L but was not changed at the
   other two centers. The clinical outcomes, biochemical parameters,
   medicine treatments, and TC markers {[}aortic arch calcification score
   (AoACS)] were compared between groups. In cohort 1, the annual mean
   serum iPTH increased significantly over 10 years. In cohort 1, 72
   patients survived for 10 years, whose doses of calcium salts and active
   vitamin D-3 and AoACs increased progressively. In cohort 2, the main
   cause of death was cardiocerebrovascular disease (CCVD) (n = 18, 48.6
   \%). Male sex and lower serum calcium concentrations were independent
   risk factors for CCVD mortality. In cohort 3, serum phosphorus, iPTH,
   and 25(OH) D decreased and serum calcium increased significantly; also,
   the doses of calcium and vitamin D-3 decreased from 2011 to 2012 in the
   DCa 1.75 group. There were no significant differences in clinical
   outcomes either between groups or between the two calendar years. Our
   results indicate that increasing DCa to 1.75 mmol/L can decrease the
   elevated levels of serum iPTH and phosphorus, reduce the doses of
   calcium and vitamin D-3, and be safe for short periods of time.}},

Abstract = {{Background/Aim: Vascular calcification is associated with cardiovascular
   risk in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Previous reports have
   shown that simple assessment of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) using
   plain radiography is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the
   general population. We conducted a prospective study to investigate
   factors associated with the presence at baseline and progression of AoAC
   in MHD patients and examined its prognostic value in a short-term
   outcome. Methods: We prospectively evaluated chest X-rays in 301
   asymptomatic MHD patients. The extent of AoAC was divided into three
   Grades (0, 1, 2+ 3). Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis
   vintage, co-morbidity and biochemical data were assessed and the
   patients were then followed for 3 years. Results: AoAC was observed in
   175 patients (58.1\%) as Grade 1, in 112 patients (37.2\%) as Grade 2
   and 3 in 63 patients (20.9\%) at baseline. An increase in the severity
   of calcification was associated with older male patients who had lower
   serum albumin levels. During the follow-up period of 3 years,
   multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade
   calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause
   mortality. Patients with AoAC were associated with a worse outcome in
   survival analysis and the grade of AAC also influenced their survival.
   Moreover, all-cause death rates were significantly higher in the
   progression groups than in the non-progression groups. Conclusions: The
   presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest X-ray were
   independently associated with mortality in MHD patients. Regular
   follow-up by chest X-ray could be a simple and useful method to stratify
   mortality risk in MHD patients. Copyright (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

   Setting Three renal outpatient centers in eastern-central Germany
   (secondary and tertiary care).
   Participants Complete survival and laboratory datasets were available in
   407 of 493 patients. Age and gender distribution was equivalent to a
   general population with end-stage CKD (CKD5D). Patients were included
   between 2008 and 2010 if at least 2weeks of maintenance treatment were
   documented.
   Primary outcome measures Mortality was estimated by setting the end of
   dialysis date as event date. Events other than death (change to another
   centre, life-sustaining renal function or transplantation) were
   censored.
   Results The OR to die within follow-up for patients in the higher of two
   total AP strata was 2.70 (95\% CI 1.76 to 4.15). In univariate
   Kaplan-Meier analysis, total AP had a strong association with all-cause

   patients who had lower albumin, higher calcium and glucose levels.
   During the follow-up period of 10 years, we found that the grade of AAC
   was directly related to cardiovascular mortality (Gr. 0: 5.3\%; Gr. 1:
   12.7\%; Gr. 2: 18.9\%, and Gr. 3: 24.4\%; p < 0.05) and all-cause
   mortality (Gr. 0: 19.9\%; Gr. 1: 31.1\%; Gr. 2:44.8\%, and Gr. 3:
   53.2\%; p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis
   revealed that high-grade calcification was associated with
   cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients with AAC were
   associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis. The severity of
   AAC also influenced their survival. Conclusion: Calcification of the
   aortic arch detected in plain chest radiography was an important
   determinant of cardiovascular as well as all-cause mortality in chronic
   hemodialysis patients. The presence and severity of AAC predicted
   longterm survival. (c) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prediabetes defined by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and
   glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) predicts incident diabetes, but their
   individual and joint associations with micro- and macro-vascular risk
   remain poorly defined.
   Methods: FPG, HbA1c, coronary artery calcium (CAC), carotid wall
   thickness, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine
   albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured in adults free from
   prior diabetes or cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Dallas Heart Study
   2 (DHS-2), a population-based cohort study. Prediabetes was defined by
   FPG 100-125 mg/dL and/or HbA1c 5.7\%-6.4\%. Multivariable logistic
   regression was used to analyse associations of HbA1c and/or FPG in the
   prediabetes range with subclinical atherosclerosis and renal measures.
   Results: The study comprised 2340 participants, median age = 49 years;
   60\% women and 50\% black. Those with prediabetes were older (52 vs 48
   years), more often men (63\% vs 53\%), black (53\% vs 47\%) and obese
   (58\% vs 40\%; p < 0.001 for each). Prediabetes was captured by FPG
   alone (43\%), HbA1c alone (30\%) or both (27\%). Those with prediabetes
   by HbA1c or FPG versus normal HbA1c/FPG had more CAC {[}odds ratio (OR)
   = 1.8; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-2.2], higher carotid wall
   thickness (1.32 vs 1.29 mm, p < 0.001), eGFR < 60 mL/min {[}OR = 1.6
   (95\% CI = 1.1-2.4)], UACR > 30 mg/dL {[}OR = 1.8 (95\% CI = 1.2-2.7)]
   and a higher odds for the composite eGFR + UACR {[}chronic kidney
   disease (CKD) 2] {[}OR = 1.9 (95\% CI = 1.5-2.6)]. After multivariable
   adjustment, none of these associations remained significant.
   Conclusion: Prediabetes defined by HbA1c and/or FPG criteria is crudely
   associated with markers of diabetic macro- and micro-vascular disease,
   but not after statistical adjustment, suggesting the relationships are
   attributable to other characteristics of the prediabetes population.}},

Volume = {{274}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesLow triiodothyronine levels, as part of the nonthyroidal
   illness syndrome, are common in dialysis patients and have repeatedly
   been shown to be associated with increased (cardiovascular) mortality
   rates. We hypothesized that increased vascular calcification may mediate
   this relationship.
   MethodsA total of 84 patients from the Stockholm region receiving
   maintenance peritoneal dialysis were included in the study. Serum
   concentrations of free triiodothyronine (fT3), thyroxine and
   thyroid-stimulating hormone were measured. Coronary artery calcium (CAC)
   scores were assessed by cardiac computed tomography scans. Surrogates of
   arterial stiffness included aortic diastolic and systolic blood
   pressures, pulse pressure, augmentation pressure and Buckberg's
   subendocardial viability ratio measured by pulse waveform analyses.
   Patients were subsequently followed, and events of death and censoring
   were recorded. Thyroid hormone concentrations were associated with CAC
   scores, measures of arterial stiffness and all-cause mortality. The
   associations between CAC scores and arterial stiffness surrogates and
   mortality were also determined to evaluate a possible causal pathway.
   ResultsBoth CAC scores and arterial stiffness surrogates were
   substantially higher in individuals with low fT3 levels. These
   associations persisted in multivariate logistic and linear regression
   analyses. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 32 (22-42)
   months, 24 patients died. Both fT3 levels below the median value {[}HR
   crude 4.1, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-12.6] and CAC scores above
   the median value (HR crude 5.8, 95\% CI 1.7-20.1) were strongly
   associated with mortality.
   ConclusionsIn patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, fT3 levels were
   strongly associated with arterial stiffness, coronary artery
   calcification and mortality. We speculate that the association between
   nonthyroidal illness and mortality may be partly mediated by
   acceleration of vascular calcification.}},

   patients}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality
   rates in chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23
   levels and impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC.
   Therefore, their relative contribution to abdominal aortic calcification
   (AAC) was examined in patients CKD stages 3-4.
   Methods: Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila Index
   (KI), were studied in 178 patients.
   Results: In multivariate linear analysis, AAC associated positively with
   age, male gender, CKD-stage, presence of carotid plaques (CP) and also
   with FGF23, but negatively with fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP).
   Intriguingly, FEP increased with similar slopes with elevations in PTH,
   with reductions in GFR, and also with elevations in FGF23 but the latter
   only in patients with none (KI = 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack of a
   FEP-FGF23 correlation in patients with severe AAC (KI > 5) suggested a
   role for an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 but not to PTH in
   AAC. Logistic and zero-inflated analysis confirmed the independent
   association of age, CKD stage, male gender and CP with AAC, and also
   identified a threshold FEP/FGF23 ratio of 1/3.9, below which the chances
   for a patient of presenting severe AAC increased by 3-fold. Accordingly,
   KI remained unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9
   but markedly increased in parallel with further reductions in FEP/FGF23
   < 1/3.9.
   Conclusions: In CKD 3-4, an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 with
   FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9 associates with severe AAC independently of age,
   gender or CP.}},

Journal = {{BMC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Background: In chronic hemodialysis patients with secondary
   hyperparathyroidism, pathological modifications of bone and mineral
   metabolism increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
   Parathyroidectomy, reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events, may
   improve outcomes; however, its effects on long-term survival are still
   subject of active research.
   We compared, in hemodialysis patients, the results of parathyroidectomy,
   in terms of cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, with those present in
   patients following medical treatment only, prior to the diffusion of
   calcimimetics.
   Methods: From January 2004 to December 2006, 30 hemodialysis patients,
   affected by severe and unresponsive secondary hyperparathyroidism,
   underwent parathyroidectomy - 15 total parathyroidectomy and 15 total
   parathyroidectomy + subcutaneous autoimplantation. During a 5-year
   follow-up, patients did not receive a renal transplantation and were
   evaluated for biochemical modifications and major cardiovascular events
   - death, cardiovascular accidents, myocardial infarction and peripheral
   vascular disease. Results were compared with those obtained in a control
   group of 20 hemodialysis patients, affected by secondary
   hyperparathyroidism, and refusing surgical treatment, and following
   medical treatment only.
   Results: The groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, dialysis
   vintage, and comorbidities. Postoperative cardiovascular events were
   observed in 18/30 54\% surgical patients and in 4/20 20\%-medical
   patients, with a mortality rate respectively of 23.3\% in the surgical
   group vs. 15\% in the control group. Parathyroidectomy was not
   associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular morbidity and survival
   rate was unaffected by surgical treatment.
   Conclusions: In secondary hyperparathyroidism hemodialysis patients
   affected by severe cardiovascular disease, surgery did not modify
   cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, in secondary
   hyperparathyroidism hemodialysis patients, resistant to medical
   treatment, only an early indication to calcimimetics, or surgery, in the
   initial stage of chronic kidney disease - mineral bone disorders, may
   offer a higher long-term survival. Further studies will be useful to
   clarify the role of secondary hyperparathyroidism in determining
   unfavorable cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in hemodialysis
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Renal transplant recipients have an increased risk of cardiovascular
   (CV) disease. Arterial stiffness (AS) and aortic calcifications (ACs)
   are well-known CV risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease.
   We aimed to determine the prognostic value of AS and AC in incident
   renal transplant recipients (RTRs). We conducted a prospective study in
   253 single RTR. AC were scored by means of lumbar X-ray. Carotid-femoral
   pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed in a subgroup of 115 patients. AC
   were present in 61\% of patients. After a mean follow-up of 36months, 32
   CV events occurred in the overall group and 13 events in the PWV
   subgroup. When we accounted for age, gender, and CV history, AC score
   (HR, hazard ratio 1.09 per 1 unit increase; 95\% CI 1.02-1.17) and PWV
   (HR 1.45 per 1m/s; 95\% CI 1.16-1.8) remained an independent predictor
   of CV events in Cox-regression analyses. Using receiver operating
   characteristics, the area under the curve for predicting CV events
   amounted to 0.80 and 0.72 for sum AC and PWV, respectively. Both AS and
   AC are strong predictors of future CV events in an incident RTR
   population. These vascular assessments are readily available and easy to
   perform, making them ideal tools for further risk stratification.

Abstract = {{Background: Peritoneal calcification (PC) is a specific finding in
   patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), but its prevalence, risk
   factors, and impacts in PD patients remain unclear. The present study
   investigated these issues and provided information useful for the
   management of PC.
   Methods: The study included 183 PD patients. The severity of PC was
   determined using abdominal computed tomography (CT), and we summed up
   all scores from slices obtained from the diaphragm to the pelvic floor
   normalized to body surface area. We analyzed the associations between PC
   and demographic and clinical characteristics, and between PC and levels
   of biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), osteoprotegrin and
   fetuin-A. The determinants of PC were examined using multiple regression
   analysis.
   Results: Patients were categorized into group 1 (without PC, n = 133)
   and group 2 (with PC, n = 50). Group 2 patients showed different degrees
   of PC with a mean of 160 +/- 769 mm(2)/m(2). Group 1 patients had higher
   fetuin-A levels than group 2 patients (861 +/- 309 vs. 760 +/- 210 mu
   g/mL; p = 0.021). The independent risk factors for the presence of PC
   included male gender, previous peritonitis, and PD adequacy (KT/V).
   Further analysis performed in group 2 patients showed that the dosage of
   vitamin D, serum levels of CRP, and dialysate calcium load were the
   independent determinants of PC. However, the presence of PC did not
   affect patients' technique survival, peritonitis incidence, or mortality
   in the mean follow up period of 28 +/- 12 months.
   Conclusions: The presence and severity of PC were associated with
   inflammation, peritoneal KT/V, and mineral metabolism. The impact of PC
   on the outcomes of PD patients requires further study with a longer
   follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Angiographically-normal coronary arteries are reported in
   10-20\% of patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography despite
   screening with risk factors and functional tests. We sought to validate
   and determine the clinical value of radial artery pulse wave analysis
   (PWA), a simple, quick and non-invasive marker of central artery
   stiffness and define its ability to predict coronary artery disease in
   high-risk patients.
   Materials and methods: 531 consecutive patients referred for elective
   coronary angiography, irrespective of previous co-morbidity, were
   assessed in a prospective, multicenter observational study {[}the
   Alternative Risk Markers in Coronary Artery Disease (ARM-CAD) study].
   Results: Mean age was 65 +/- 11 years, 33\% were women, 18\% had
   impaired left-ventricular function and 22\% a prior myocardial
   infarction. Angiography demonstrated normal coronary arteries in 20\% of
   participants. The only independent associations with this outcome were
   younger age, female gender, absence of diabetes and PWA-derived central
   augmentation pressure <24 mm Hg. The odds ratio for the latter after
   adjustment for medications and baseline risk factors (including blood
   pressure, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and B-type natriuretic
   peptide) was 3.4 (95\% CI 1.2 to 9.5; p=0.021). The specificity for the

   curve area of 0.876. Validation studies suggested that systolic
   variables from PWA were robust regardless of waveform quality and
   similar to measured aortic pressures (mean difference 2.7 mm Hg).
   Conclusions: Assessment of radial artery waveforms is a useful
   non-invasive clinical test that can stratify the likelihood of coronary

Abstract = {{Context: Sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist produced by osteocytes, regulates
   osteoblast activity and is a well-established key player in bone
   turnover. Recent data indicate that the Wnt pathway may also be involved
   in vascular calcification.
   Objective: The present study tests the hypothesis that serum sclerostin
   levels are associated with vascular calcification in patients with
   chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet receiving dialysis.
   Design, Setting, Participants, and Measurements: We performed a
   cross-sectional analysis in 154 patients with CKD. Aortic calcification
   (AC) was assessed by lumbar X-ray and scored with a maximum score of 24.
   In addition to traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular (CV) risk
   factors, serum sclerostin levels were assessed (ELISA). Regression
   analysis was performed to identify determinants of serum sclerostin and
   AC.
   Results: AC was present in 59\% of patients. Older age (P < .0001), male
   sex (P = .006), lower estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) (P = .0008),
   lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = .03), and the absence of
   AC (P = .006) were identified as independent determinants of higher
   serum sclerostin levels. In univariate logistic regression, higher age,
   diabetes, CV history, higher body mass index, higher serum C-reactive
   protein and sclerostin levels and lower estimated glomerular rate were
   all associated with the presence of AC. In multivariate analysis, lower,
   not higher, sclerostin levels (P = .04, odds ratio {[}OR] per ng/mL of
   0.24), higher age (P < .0001, OR per year of 1.17) and CV history (P =
   .02, OR for a positive CV history of 3.83) were identified as
   independent determinants of AC.
   Conclusions: In this cohort of patients with CKD, we found that patients
   with aortic calcifications (ACs) had higher sclerostin levels. However,
   in multivariate analysis, the association became inverse. Additional
   clinical and experimental studies are urgently required to clarify
   whether or not sclerostin protects against progression of vascular
   calcification.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have provided information on the prevalence of vertebral
   fractures (VFs) and their risk factors in hemodialysis patients. A
   multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study was carried out to
   assess the prevalence of VFs and vascular calcifications (VCs) in 387
   hemodialysis patients (mean age 64.2 +/- A 14.1 years, 63 \% males) and
   in a control group of 51 osteoporotic subjects. Biochemical tests
   included 25(OH) vitamin D, bone Gla protein (total and
   undercarboxylated), and total matrix Gla protein. Vertebral quantitative
   morphometry was carried out centrally for the detection of VF, defined
   as reduction by a parts per thousand yen20 \% of one of the vertebral
   body dimensions. In the same radiograph, aortic and iliac VC scores were
   calculated. Prevalence of VF was 55.3 \% in hemodialysis patients and
   51.0 \% in the control group. Multivariate analysis disclosed that male
   gender (59.8 vs. 47.6 \%, p = 0.02; OR = 1.78, 95 \% CI 1.15-2.75) and
   age (mean +/- A SD 66.7 +/- A 13.1 vs. 61.0 +/- A 14.7 years, p < 0.001;
   OR = 1.03, 95 \% CI 1.01-1.05) were significantly associated with VF.
   The prevalence of aortic VC was significantly higher in hemodialysis
   patients than in controls (80.6 vs. 68.4 \%, p = 0.001). The factors
   with the strongest association with VC, apart from atrial fibrillation,
   were serum 25(OH)vitamin D levels below 29 ng/mL for aortic VC (OR =
   1.85, 95 \% CI 1.04-3.29) and VF both for aortic (OR = 1.77, 95 \% CI
   1.00-3.14) and iliac (OR = 1.96, 95 \% CI 1.27-3.04) VC. In conclusion,
   the prevalence of VF, especially in males, and VC, in both genders, is
   high in hemodialysis patients. VF is associated with VC. Vitamin D
   deficiency is also associated with VC. Further longitudinal studies are
   warranted to investigate fractures in renal patients.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains excessive in
   patients with chronic kidney disease. The association of vascular
   changes with regulators of extraosseous calcification in this patient
   population is still under investigation. The aim of the present study
   was to investigate the associations of the calcification inhibitor
   fetuin-A, and the anti-osteoclastic factor osteoprotegerin (OPG) with
   vascular pathology in chronic hemodialysis patients.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study including 81 stable chronic
   hemodialysis patients, we measured carotid-to-femoral pulse wave
   velocity (cfPWV) with applanation tonometry, reflecting arterial
   stiffness, and common carotid intima-media thickness (ccIMT), a
   surrogate of early atherosclerosis, as well as serum levels of fetuin-A
   and OPG. Co-morbidities, traditional cardiovascular risk factors,
   inflammatory markers and mineral-bone disease serology parameters were
   also recorded.
   Results: cfPWV correlated inversely with fetuin-A (r=-0.355, p=0.001)
   and positively with OPG (r=0.584, p<0.001). In multilinear regression
   analysis including age, gender, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
   hypertension, pulse pressure, LDL, logCRP, both fetuin-A and OPG were
   independently associated with cfPWV (p=0.024 and p=0.041 respectively).
   ccIMT was negatively associated with fetuin-A (r=-0.312, p=0.005) and
   positively with OPG (r=0.521, p<0.0001); however these associations lost
   statistical significance after adjustment for age.
   Conclusion: In chronic hemodialysis patients both fetuin-A and OPG
   levels are independently associated with arterial stiffness but not with
   early atherosclerotic vascular changes.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Sudden cardiac death is the most common cause
   of mortality in chronic kidney disease patients, and it occurs mostly
   due to ventricular arrhythmias. In this study, we aimed at investigating
   the prevalence of ventricular arrhythmia and the factors associated with
   its occurrence in nondialyzed chronic kidney disease patients.
   Design, Setting, Participants and Measurements: This cross-sectional
   study evaluated 111 chronic kidney disease patients (estimated
   glomerular filtration rate 34.7 +/- 16.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2), 57 +/- 11.4
   years, 60\% male, 24\% diabetics). Ventricular arrhythmia was assessed
   by 24-hour electrocardiogram. Left ventricular hypertrophy
   (echocardiogram), 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and
   coronary artery calcification (multi-slice computed tomography) and
   laboratory parameters were also evaluated.
   Results: Ventricular arrhythmia was found in 35\% of the patients.
   Non-controlled hypertension was observed in 21\%, absence of systolic
   decency in 29\%, left ventricular hypertrophy in 27\%, systolic
   dysfunction in 10\%, and coronary artery calcification in 49\%. Patients
   with ventricular arrhythmia were older (p<0.001), predominantly men (p =
   0.009), had higher estimated glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.03) and
   hemoglobin (p = 0.005), and lower intact parathyroid hormone (p = 0.024)
   and triglycerides (p = 0.011) when compared to patients without
   ventricular arrhythmia. In addition, a higher left ventricular mass
   index (p = 0.002) and coronary calcium score (p = 0.002), and a lower
   ejection fraction (p = 0.001) were observed among patients with
   ventricular arrhythmia. In the multiple logistic regression analysis,
   aging, increased hemoglobin levels and reduced ejection fraction were
   independently related to the presence of ventricular arrhythmia.
   Conclusions: Ventricular arrhythmia is prevalent in nondialyzed chronic

Abstract = {{White matter lesions have detrimental effects upon older adults, while
   serum calcium levels have been associated with elevated vascular risk
   and may be associated with these lesions. Depression, a serious mental
   disorder characterized by disturbances in calcium metabolism, may be an
   important contributor to any calcium-lesion relationship. This
   cross-sectional pilot study examined the association between serum
   ionized calcium (the physiologically active form of calcium) and white
   matter lesion volumes in a sample of depressed and non-depressed older
   adults (N = 42; 60 years and older). Serum ionized calcium was
   determined using an ion-selective electrode technique, while lesion
   volumes were estimated from magnetic resonance imaging using an
   automated expectation-maximization segmentation. A linear regression
   model, controlling for age and group (depression vs. comparison), showed
   a trend for a positive relationship between serum ionized calcium and
   white matter lesion volume (beta = 4.34, SE = 2.27, t = 1.91, p =
   0.063). Subsample analyses with depressed participants showed a
   significant positive relationship between higher ionic calcium and
   greater lesion volume (beta = 6.41, SE = 2.53, t = 2.53, p = 0.018), but
   no association was found for non-depressed participants. Sex-specific
   subsample analyses showed a significant positive relationship between
   higher calcium and greater lesion volume in men only (beta = 7.49, SE =
   3.42, t = 2.19, p = 0.041). These preliminary results indicate that
   serum ionized calcium may be associated with white matter lesions in
   older adults, particularly among men and individuals with depression.
   Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term hemodialysis patients are prone to an exceptionally high
   burden of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The novel
   temperature-based technology of digital thermal monitoring (DTM) of
   vascular reactivity appears associated with the severity of coronary
   artery disease in asymptomatic population. We hypothesized that in
   hemodialysis patients, the DTM and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score
   have a gradient association that follows that of subjects without kidney
   disease. We examined the cross-sectional DTM-CAC associations in a group
   of long-term hemodialysis patients, and their 1:1 matched normal
   counterpart. Area under the curve for temperature (TMP-AUC), the
   surrogate of the DTM index of vascular function, was assessed after a
   5-minute arm-cuff reactive hyperemia test. Coronary calcium score was
   measured via electron beam computed tomography or multidetector computed
   tomography scan. We studied 105 randomly recruited hemodialysis patients
   (age: 58 +/- 13 years, 47\% men) and 105 age- and gender-matched
   controls. In hemodialysis patients vs. controls, TMP-AUC was

   case vs. control for each standard deviation decrease in TMP-AUC was
   1.46 (95\% confidence interval: 1.121.93, P=0.007). Vascular reactivity
   measured via the novel DTM technology is incrementally worse across CAC

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular calcification is currently viewed as an active disease
   process similar to embryonic bone formation. Cardiovascular
   calcification mainly affects the aortic valve and arteries and is
   associated with increased mortality risk. Aortic valve and arterial
   calcification share similar risk factors, including age, gender,
   diabetes, chronic renal disease, and smoking. However, the exact
   cellular and molecular mechanism of cardiovascular calcification is
   unknown. Late-stage cardiovascular calcification can be visualized with
   conventional imaging modalities such as echocardiography and computed
   tomography. However, these modalities are limited in their ability to
   detect the development of early calcification and the progression of
   calcification until advanced tissue mineralization is apparent. Due to
   the subsequent late diagnosis of cardiovascular calcification, treatment
   is usually comprised of invasive interventions such as surgery. The need
   to understand the process of calcification is therefore warranted and
   requires new imaging modalities which are able to visualize early
   cardiovascular calcification. This review focuses on the use of new
   imaging techniques to visualize novel concepts of cardiovascular
   calcification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{High serum phosphorus levels have been linked with vascular
   calcification and greater cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We
   assessed whether serum phosphorus was associated with the atrial
   fibrillation (AF) incidence in a large community-based cohort in the
   United States. Our analysis included 14,675 participants (25\% black,
   45\% men) free of AF at baseline (1987 to 1989) and with measurements of
   fasting serum phosphorus from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities
   (ARIC) study. The incidence of AF was ascertained through the end of
   2008 from study visit electrocardiograms, hospitalizations, and death
   certificates. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the
   hazard ratios of AF by the serum phosphorus levels, adjusting for
   potential confounders. During a median follow-up of 19.7 years, we
   identified 1,656 incident AF cases. Greater serum phosphorus was
   associated with a greater AF risk: the hazard ratio of AF with a 1-mg/dl
   increase in serum phosphorus was 1.13 (95\% confidence interval 1.02 to
   1.26). No significant interaction was seen by race (p = 0.88) or gender
   (p = 0.51). The risk of AF was increased in association with greater
   serum phosphorus in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate
   of >= 90 ml/min/1.72 m(2) but not among those with an estimated
   glomerular filtration rate of <90 ml/min/1.72 m(2). The total corrected
   calcium levels were not related to AF risk; however,, greater levels of
   the calcium-phosphorus product were associated with greater AF risk. In
   conclusion, in the present large population-based study, greater levels
   of serum phosphorus and the related calcium-phosphorus product were
   associated with a greater incidence of AF. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Aim. To study the prevalence of and risk factors (RF) associated with
   cardiovascular system damage in patients with predialysis diabetic and
   nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   Subjects and methods. The investigation enrolled 317 patients with CKD
   of various etiologies. In Group 1 (165 patients with CKD: 54\% of men,
   46\% of women; mean age 46 15 years), the glomerular filtration rate
   (GFR) was 37.2 ml/min; the serum creatinine level was 2.9 mg/dl. Group 2
   included 152 (41\%) patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (41\% of
   men and 59\% of women; mean age 57.3 +/- 7.1 years). The duration of DM
   averaged 10.4 +/- 7.1 years. All the patients underwent physical
   examination; the levels of glycated hemoglobin and adipose tissue
   hormones, urinary albumin excretion were additionally determined in the
   diabetic patients. Echocardiography was performed in 172 patients. The
   influence of populationwide and renal failure-associated RFs on the
   cardiovascular system was evaluated in CKD.
   Results. Clinical and instrumental examinations of 165 patients with
   Stages II-IV nondiabetic CKD revealed atherosclerosis of the aorta and
   the vessels of the heart, brain, kidney, and lower extremities in 60
   (37\%), 35 (24\%), 30 (18\%), 23 (14\%), and 8 (5\%), respectively. As
   atherosclerotic vascular lesion progressed, the incidence of
   cardiovascular events (CVE) increased. Left ventricular hypertrophy
   (LVH) was diagnosed in 37.3\% of the patients with nondiabetic CKD.
   Along with traditional cardiovascular RFs (age, smoking, gender,
   arterial hypertension), the renal dysfunction-related factors (anemia,
   diminished glomerular filtration rate, elevated creatitine levels, and
   abnormal phosphorus and calcium metabolism) are of importance. An
   association was found between LVH, atherosclerotic vascular lesion, and
   heart valve calcification. According to EchoCG data, 36\% of the
   patients with type 2 DM were diagnosed as having LVH. The RFs of the
   latter were albuminuria, obesity, and abnormal carbohydrate and purine
   metabolisms. There was an association of diabetic nephropathy with left
   ventricular remodeling processes and a history of CVE.
   Conclusion. The development of cardiorenal syndrome is observed in
   early-stage CKD and related to both traditional and renal RFs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), also known as
   calciphylaxis, is characterized by vascular calcification, thrombosis
   and intense inflammation. Prior research has shown that statins have
   anticalcification, antithrombotic and antiinflammatory properties;
   however, the association between statin use and CUA has not been
   investigated. Methods: This matched case-control study included 62 adult
   maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients with biopsy-confirmed CUA
   diagnosed between the years 2002 and 2011 (cases). All cases were
   hospitalized at the time of diagnosis. Controls (n = 124) were
   hospitalized maintenance HD patients without CUA (matched to cases by
   gender and timing of hospitalization). Univariate and multivariable
   logistic regression models were applied to compute odds ratio (OR) and
   95\% confidence intervals (CI) for CUA in statin users, and also to
   examine previously described associations. Results: The mean age of
   cases was 58 years. Most were females (68\%), and of white race (64\%).
   Statin use was more common in controls than in cases (39 vs. 19\%, p <
   0.01). Statin use was associated with lower odds of CUA in unadjusted
   (OR 0.38, 95\% CI 0.18-0.79) and adjusted (OR 0.20, 95\% CI 0.05-0.88)
   analyses. Hypercalcemia (OR 2.25, 95\% CI 1.14-4.43), hypoalbuminemia
   (OR 5.73, 95\% CI 2.79-11.77), calcitriol use (OR 5.69, 95\% CI
   1.02-31.77) and warfarin use (OR 4.30, 95\% CI 1.57-11.74) were
   positively associated with CUA in adjusted analyses whereas paricalcitol
   and doxercalciferol were not (OR 1.33, 95\% CI 0.54-3.27). Conclusion:
   Statin use may be negatively associated with odds of CUA. Further large
   prospective studies with attention to potential confounders are needed
   to confirm these findings. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is proposed as a
   cardiovascular risk marker in non-uremic subjects. However, little is
   known about its role in patients with higher cardiovascular risk profile
   such as chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to investigate
   the relationship between EAT and several cardiovascular surrogate
   markers (coronary artery calcification (CAC), arterial stiffness and
   atherosclerosis) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
   Methods: A total of 191 prevalent hemodialysis patients were enrolled in
   this cross-sectional study. EAT and CAC scores (CACs) were determined by
   multi-slice computerized tomography, arterial stiffness by
   carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and carotid artery
   intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) by B-mode doppler ultrasonography.
   Results: Mean age was 59 +/- 13 years and time on hemodialysis 75 +/- 44
   months. Twenty percent of the patients had diabetes. Mean EAT volume was
   62.6 +/- 26.8 cm(3)/m(2). Mean CA-IMT and PWV values increased across
   the EAT tertiles. EAT was correlated with age, female gender, body mass
   index, albumin and lipid parameters. Additionally, CA-IMT and PWV values
   were positively correlated with EAT. EAT volume was significantly higher
   in patients with CACs > 10 compared to the patients with CACs <10.
   Despite the univariate associations between EAT and cardiovascular
   surrogate markers, only age, body mass index and total cholesterol
   levels were associated with EAT in adjusted models.
   Conclusions: In prevalent hemodialysis patients, EAT is correlated with
   atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and the presence of CAC. However,
   this correlation is not independent of other risk factors. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Cause-and-effect associations between sevelamer hydrochloride (HCl) and
   mortality have yet to be clarified. The effects of sevelamer HCl on
   mortality, lipid abnormality and arterial stiffness were examined in
   patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5D.
   The effects of sevelamer HCl were studied by a single-center cohort
   study that was conducted from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2008 (n =
   483). By the end of the study, 172 patients (Sevelamer group) had
   succeeded in continuing sevelamer HCl for > 6 months (median 37 months),
   and 300 patients (Control group) had received calcium carbonate (n =
   264) or no phosphate binder (n = 36). The mortality and other outcomes
   were compared between these two groups after matching by a propensity
   score calculated using age, gender, diabetes prevalence, and dialysis
   vintage.
   All-cause {[}hazard ratio (HR) 0.4, P = 0.02] and cardiovascular
   (CV)-cause {[}HR 0.29, P = 0.03] cumulative mortality were significantly
   lower in the matched Sevelamer group than in the matched Control group.
   The matched Sevelamer group showed increased high-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol (P = 0.003) and no change in pulse wave velocity (PWV) and
   ankle-brachial index (ABI), whereas the matched Control group showed
   increased serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P = 0.003),
   increased PWV (P = 0.03), and decreased ABI (P = 0.0009). Change in
   serum LDL cholesterol level correlated inversely with sevelamer HCl
   dosage (P = 0.02).
   Reduced mortality in patients with sevelamer HCl may, at least in part,
   be explained by an improvement in dyslipidemia and arterial stiffness by
   sevelamer HCl.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate population-based cardiovascular risk scores and
   coronary artery calcification scores (CACS) in amputees.
   Design: A retrospective cohort study of 1300 veterans in a cardiac
   computed tomography database.
   Seffing: 1B Veterans Administration medical center.
   Participants: A total of 76 amputees and similar number of age-,
   gender-, and Framingham Risk Scores (FRS)-matched control subjects.
   Methods: The amputee population was identified and compared for CACS and
   traditional cardiac risk factors. Two control groups were used: control
   group 1, with known risk factors including diabetes mellitus, and
   control group 2, with all risk factors without diabetes mellitus.
   Main Outcome Measures: Statistical associations between amputee and
   control group FRS scores, CACS, and other cardiac risk factors were
   assessed.
   Results: The study included 57 nontraumatic and 19 traumatic amputees
   with an average age of 62.4 years. Sixty-six amputees were in the
   low-to-intermediate cardiac risk groups according to FRS. Despite this
   classification, the mean CACS were significantly higher in amputees
   (1285 +/- 18) than in either of the control groups: control group 1 (540
   +/- 84) and control group 2 (481 +/- 11), P < .001. CACS also were
   significantly higher in the nontraumatic subject group (1595 +/- 12)
   compared with the traumatic group (356 +/- 57; P < .001). Upon
   categorization of CACS based on probability of coronary artery disease
   (CAD), 76\% of amputees had a CACS > 100 and 38\% of amputees had a CACS
   > 1000. Interestingly, CACS were almost the same in finger/toe
   amputations compared with an above-knee amputation, indicating an
   already ongoing CAD process irrespective of level of amputation. The
   predominant clinical significant cardiac risk factors in amputees are
   hypertension (89.5\%), P < .005; chronic kidney disease (31.6\%), P <
   .001; dyslipidemia (72.4\%), P < .04; and insulin resistance. Total
   cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein
   levels were nonsignificantly low in all amputees. Triglycerides were
   particularly higher in traumatic patients compared with nontraumatic
   patients, with the triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein ratio >7.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that amputees have a much greater
   burden of underlying atherosclerotic disease as detected by CACS than do
   control subjects matched by Framingham risk stratification. Early
   screening for CAD and aggressive targeted interventions may be an
   important part of management to reduce early mortality after amputation.

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with
   chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent data implicate disordered bone and
   mineral metabolism, including changes in serum levels of calcium,
   phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, fibroblast growth
   factor-23 (FGF-23), and fetuin A, as novel risk factors for arterial
   calcification. The potential role of calcitonin, another hormonal
   regulator of mineral and bone metabolism, has not been studied in
   detail.
   We investigated the link between serum calcitonin and the total burden
   of coronary artery disease (CAD) using the validated Gensini score, in a
   cross-sectional study of 88 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) between
   46 and 87 ml/min/1.73 mA(2) who underwent coronary angiography. We
   evaluated the associations between serum calcitonin, minerals (calcium,
   phosphate), calcium x phosphate product, and other factors that regulate
   mineral metabolism (intact PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D, FGF-23, and fetuin A)
   and the severity of CAD.
   The mean serum calcitonin was 11.5 +/- A 7.8 pg/ml. In univariate
   analysis, the Gensini CAD severity score correlated significantly with
   male gender, eGFR, and serum levels of 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF-23,
   fetuin A, and calcitonin (R = 0.474, P = 0.001 for the latter). In
   multivariate analysis adjusted for calcium, phosphate, 25-OH-vitamin D,
   iPTH, FGF 23, fetuin A, and calcitonin, only calcitonin (beta = 0.20; P
   = 0.03), FGF-23, fetuin A, and 25-OH-vitamin D emerged as independent
   predictors of Gensini score. In the second step, we adjusted for the
   presence of traditional risk factors, proteinuria, and GFR. After these
   adjustments, the FGF-23 and fetuin A remained statistically significant
   predictors of the Gensini score, while calcitonin did not.
   Our study suggests that, in addition to other well-known components of
   mineral metabolism, increased calcitonin levels are associated with
   greater severity of CAD. However, this relation was not independent of
   traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. Longitudinal
   studies in larger populations including patients with more advanced CKD
   are needed.}},

Title = {{Aortic Calcification and Femoral Bone Density Are Independently
   Associated with Left Ventricular Mass in Patients with Chronic Kidney

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background: Vascular calcification and reduced bone density are
   prevalent in chronic kidney disease and linked to increased
   cardiovascular risk. The mechanism is unknown. We assessed the
   relationship between vascular calcification, femoral bone density and
   left ventricular mass in patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic
   kidney disease in a cross-sectional observational study.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: A total of 120 patients were
   recruited (54\% male, mean age 55 +/- 14 years, mean glomerular
   filtration rate 50 +/- 13 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Abdominal aortic
   calcification was assessed using lateral lumbar spine radiography and
   was present in 48\%. Mean femoral Z-score measured using dual energy
   x-ray absorptiometry was 0.60 +/- 1.06. Cardiovascular magnetic
   resonance imaging was used to determine left ventricular mass. One
   patient had left ventricular hypertrophy. Subjects with aortic
   calcification had higher left ventricular mass compared to those without
   (56 +/- 16 vs. 48 +/- 12 g/m(2), P=0.002), as did patients with femoral
   Z-scores below zero (56 +/- 15 vs. 49 +/- 13 g/m(2), P=0.01). In
   univariate analysis presence of aortic calcification correlated with
   left ventricular mass (r=0.32, P=0.001); mean femoral Z-score inversely
   correlated with left ventricular mass (r= -0.28, P=0.004). In a
   multivariate regression model that included presence of aortic
   calcification, mean femoral Z-score, gender and 24-hour systolic blood
   pressure, 46\% of the variability in left ventricular mass was explained
   (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: In patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney
   disease, lower mean femoral Z-score and presence of aortic calcification

Abstract = {{Background: Accelerated vascular calcification contributes to
   cardiovascular disease burden in patients with chronic kidney disease
   (CKD). We hypothesized that bisphosphonate therapy would reduce the risk
   of mortality and cardiovascular events in this population.
   Study Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting \& Participants: Adult women with stage 3 or 4 CKD receiving
   primary care in a large rural integrated health care system in
   2004-2010.
   Exposure: Time-dependent exposure status based on outpatient
   prescription for any medication within the bisphosphonate class,
   obtained from electronic health records.
   Outcomes: Time to death and first cardiovascular event (composite of
   myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke).
   Results: Data from 9,604 eligible female patients with CKD were
   analyzed; 3,234 were treated with bisphosphonate therapy. During a
   median follow-up of 3.9 (25th-75th percentile, 2.3-5.4) years, there
   were 286 versus 881 deaths and 206 versus 571 cardiovascular events
   (treated vs not-treated groups, respectively). In a multivariate Cox
   proportional hazard model, the adjusted HR for death (treated vs not
   treated) was 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.67-0.91; P = 0.003). In Cox modeling
   adjusted for similar baseline covariates, treatment with bisphosphonates
   was not associated with a lower risk of the composite cardiovascular
   outcome (adjusted HR, 1.14; 95\% CI, 0.94-1.39; P = 0.2).
   Limitations: Residual confounding by unidentified factors, exclusion of
   male patients, and lack of information about longitudinal drug
   adherence.
   Conclusions: For female patients with CKD, treatment with
   bisphosphonates is associated with a lower risk of death, but not
   cardiovascular events. Confirmatory studies and investigations of
   potential causal mechanisms are warranted. Am J Kidney Dis. 59(5):

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the relationship of plasma fetuin-A levels with
   markers of bone turnover in male and female type 2 diabetic subjects.
   Background Fetuin-A, which is a serum protein produced by the liver and
   promotes bone mineralization, is an independent risk factor for type 2
   diabetes, whilst type 2 diabetes is associated with an increased
   incidence of osteoporosis or fractures. It is not known how fetuin-A
   levels relate to parameters of bone metabolism in type 2 diabetes.
   Design and patients Eighty patients with type 2 diabetes {[}40 men and
   40 women matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and time since diagnosis
   of diabetes] were studied. Fetuin-A together with metabolic parameters
   and levels of serum carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen
   (C-telopeptide), osteocalcin, procollagen type 1 amino-terminal
   propeptide (P1NP), bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and sex hormones was
   determined in all participants. Results Fetuin-A levels did not differ
   significantly between male and female diabetic subjects. In a model
   adjusted for age, BMI, fatty liver index (FLI), time since diagnosis of
   diabetes, HbA1c, antidiabetic and lipid-lowering drug therapies,
   smoking, total serum protein, creatinine, gamma glutamyl-transferase,
   parathyroid hormone, C-reactive protein, glomerular filtration rate, and
   presence of micro-, cardio-, and peripheral vascular diabetic
   complications, fetuin-A showed a significant positive association with
   levels of bone ALP (r = 0 71, P = 0 006) in men. In women, fetuin-A was
   significantly negatively associated with C-telopeptide (r =) 0 60, P = 0
   03) levels. Conclusions Results suggest an independent association of
   fetuin- A levels with markers of bone turnover in male and female
   patients with type 2 diabetes. More studies are needed to determine
   whether fetuin-A could serve as a new marker for fracture risk or
   osteoporosis in type 2 diabetes and to explore its potential sexually
   dimorphic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Calciphylaxis, also called calcific uremic arteriolopathy,
   is a rare and often fatal complication of end-stage renal disease and is
   characterized by painful skin ulceration, necrosis, medial calcification
   and intimal proliferation of small arteries. Studies in western
   countries have reported incidences ranging from 1 to 4\% in chronic
   hemodialysis patients. Since no systematic studies of calciphylaxis have
   ever been performed in Japan, we conducted a nationwide survey and a
   case-control study to identify the characteristics of calciphylaxis in
   the Japanese dialysis population.
   Methods. Firstly, we sent a questionnaire to 3760 hemodialysis centers
   in Japan, asking whether calciphylaxis cases had been encountered in the
   past, and detailed clinical data regarding each case were then collected
   from the centers. In addition, two control dialysis patients matched for
   age and duration of hemodialysis to each calciphylaxis case were
   identified at the participating centers, and their data were analyzed to
   identify risk factors for calciphylaxis.
   Results. Responses to the questionnaire were obtained from 1838 centers
   (48.3\%), and 151 centers reported that a total of 249 cases had been
   encountered. Sixty-four centers agreed to participate in the
   case-control study, and detailed clinical data in regard to 67 cases
   were obtained. In 28 of the 67 cases, a definite diagnosis of
   calciphylaxis was made by our study group based on the clinical
   characteristics and skin biopsy findings. A univariate logistic
   regression model comparing them with 56-matched controls identified
   warfarin therapy {[}odds ratio (OR) 11.4, 95\% confidence interval (CI)]
   2.7-48.1, P = 0.0009], each 1 g/dL decline in serum albumin level (OR
   19.8, 95\% CI 4.4-89.5, P = 0.0001), each 100 mg/dL increment in plasma
   glucose level (OR 3.74, 95\% CI 1.08-12.9, P = 0.037) and each 1 mg/dL
   increment in adjusted serum calcium level (OR 3.2, 95\% CI 1.63-6.30, P
   = 0.0008) at the time of diagnosis as significantly associated with
   calciphylaxis, but no significant associations were found with female
   gender, vitamin D analog therapy, serum phosphate level, adjusted
   calcium-phosphate products or serum alkaline-phosphatase level. Warfarin
   therapy and lower serum albumin levels were still significant risk
   factors after a multivariate logistic regression model analysis.
   Conclusion. The results of this study showed that warfarin therapy and
   lower serum albumin levels are significant and strong risk factors for
   the development of calciphylaxis in chronic hemodialysis patients in
   Japan.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hemodialysis patients (HD) display high rates of cardiac
   disease and mortality. The cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of HD
   patients is attributable in a significant proportion to endothelial
   dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and vascular calcifications. Aim: To
   measure vascular reactivity in HD subjects and compare them with healthy
   volunteers. Material and Methods: Forty eight non diabetic patients aged
   58 +/- 4.6 years (29 males) on hemodialysis for a mean lapse of 4.8
   years were studied. Arterial stiffness was measured in the radial
   artery. Pulse wave velocity was measured by noninvasive peripheral
   arterial tonometry in carotid and femoral arteries. Endothelial function
   was assessed, measuring reactive hyperemia response after a 5 min period
   of ischemia. As a control, all values were also measured in age and
   gender-matched healthy volunteers. Results: Arterial stiffness was
   significantly higher in HD patients than controls (23.9 +/- 3.3 and 18.4
   +/- 3.4\% respectively, p < 0.05). HD subjects had an increased pulse
   wave velocity (10.0 +/- 0.8 and 7.6 +/- 0.9 m/s respectively, p < 0.05).
   A reduction in the change in pulse amplitude pressure, as a measure of
   arterial dysfunction, was only observed in male patients (1.7 +/- 0.4
   and 2.7 +/- 0.4 respectively p < 0.01). Conclusions: Noninvasive
   assessment of peripheral vascular function may be useful for the
   identification of patients at risk for late cardiac events. (Rev Med

Abstract = {{The best treatment for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is kidney
   transplantation, but the renal transplant recipients still have a higher
   incidence of cardiovascular events compared with general population.
   Cardiovascular risk factors were imposed long before ESRD, as the
   majority of patients starting dialysis or kidney transplantation already
   have signs of advanced atherosclerosis. Artery calcification is an
   organized, regulated process similar to bone formation. Coronary artery
   calcification (CAC) is found frequently in advanced atherosclerotic
   lesions and could be a useful marker of them. We evaluated the
   prevalence of CAC in 49 stable renal transplant recipients and in 48
   age- and gender-matched patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
   stages 2-5 not requiring dialysis to assess risk factors associated with
   CAC. Computed tomography was used for CAC detection and quantification
   (CAC score). The prevalence of CAC was 43.8\% in transplant recipients
   and 16.7\% in CKD patients (p < 0.001). Transplant recipients with CAC
   were significantly older and had longer duration of CKD and/or dialysis
   than recipients without CAC. In contrast, the serum levels of fetuin A
   (an inhibitor of vascular calcification) and albumin were significantly
   lower in CKD patients with CAC than those without CAC. During the
   observation period (30 months), 30 patients, including 23 CKD patients,
   began dialysis, and 4 transplant recipients and 2 CKD patients died.
   Independent predictors of mortality were age, serum amyloid A and the
   CAC score. In conclusion, the examination and prevention of risk factors
   associated with atherosclerosis should be started at the beginning of
   renal failure.}},

Abstract = {{Background/aims: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence
   of vitamin D deficiency in hemodialysis (HD) patients and the
   relationship between seasonal variations in vitamin D levels and
   vascular calcification.
   Methods: As a prospective observational study, we analyzed 289 HD
   patients. We have assessed serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) levels at the
   end of the summer (September) and winter (March) and analyzed the data
   to reveal the association of serum 25D level with vascular calcification
   scores (VCS) at the end of the summer, when vitamin D levels were found
   to peak. Plan X-ray images of lateral lumbar spine from all subjects
   were studied for calculation of semiquantitative VCS as described by
   Kauppila.
   Results: The prevalence of 25D deficiency was 86.2\% at the end of the
   summer and increased to 96.2\% at the end of the winter. Female gender
   and diabetes were associated with vitamin D deficiency. According to
   univariate analysis, 25D levels were inversely related to vascular
   calcification. However, after correcting for confounding factors, this
   relationship lost statistical significance. Multivariate analysis showed
   that age, systolic blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol levels were
   directly associated with a higher VCS.
   Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in HD patients
   with marked seasonal variation. However, low 25D levels could not be
   identified as an independent predictor of vascular calcification in
   these patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Design A cross-sectional observational study.
   Setting Single centre.
   Patients 208 patients with stage 2 to stage 4 non-diabetic CKD.
   Interventions Arterial stiffness was determined through measurement of
   aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV). Cardiac magnetic resonance was used to
   determine LVM.
   Main outcome measure Relationship between serum phosphate, aortic PWV
   and LVM.
   Results Mean age was 54 +/- 13 years, mean glomerular filtration rate
   was 50 +/- 15 ml/min/1.73 m(2), mean serum phosphate was 1.11 +/- 0.21
   mmol/l and mean PWV was 8.6 +/- 2.1 m/s. When the cohort was divided
   into quartiles according to serum phosphate, LVM increased across
   quartiles (p=0.04), with no significant differences in age, kidney
   function, blood pressure or PWV. Serum phosphate correlated with LVM
   (r=0.173; p=0.01), but PWV did not (p=0.2). In a regression model
   containing gender, serum phosphate, office systolic blood pressure,
   albumin/creatinine ratio and haemoglobin, 30\% of the variation in LVM
   was explained (p<0.0005), with serum phosphate accounting for 5\% of the

Abstract = {{Background: Atherosclerosis is an important predictor of mortality in
   patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to
   determine how various vascular comorbidities such as coronary heart
   disease (CHD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) or cerebrovascular
   disease (CeVD) affect survival of type 2 diabetic patients on renal
   replacement therapy (RRT). Methods: Patients who entered RRT because of
   type 2 diabetes in 2000-2008 (n = 877) were identified within the
   Finnish Registry for Kidney Diseases. The patients were followed up
   until death or end of follow-up. Survival probabilities were calculated
   using Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate modeling was performed using Cox
   regression. Results: 41\% of the patients had CHD, 27\% PVD and 16\%
   CeVD at the start of RRT. Patients with PVD had a 1.9-fold (95\% CI
   1.6-2.3) risk of death compared to those without PVD when adjusting for
   age and gender, while patients with CHD had a 1.5-fold (95\% CI 1.2-1.8)
   and those with CeVD a 1.4-fold (95\% CI 1.1-1.8) risk compared to those
   without these diseases. The hazard ratio (HR) for death was highest in
   patients with the combination of PVD and either CHD (HR 2.8, 95\% CI
   2.1-3.8) or CeVD (HR 2.9, 95\% CI 1.6-5.2) as compared to patients
   without any vascular comorbidities. Conclusion: PVD is the vascular
   comorbidity that increases risk of death the most among patients with
   type 2 diabetes starting RRT. Prevention of PVD in this patient group
   would merit further studies. copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{We previously demonstrated that anemia was not associated with mortality
   in hemodialysis patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Since
   diabetes mellitus (DM) accelerates CVD, the influence of DM on the
   relationship between anemia and mortality was examined using the data
   obtained from 1,385 DM patients and 2,583 non-DM hemodialysis patients
   recruited into the Dialysis Outcomes Practice Pattern Study in Japan
   (J-DOPPS). When all patients were stratified into four groups on their
   hematocrit levels, mortality rate was significantly and steadily lower
   in the subgroups with the higher levels of hematocrit by the
   Kaplan-Meier method (p = 0.0003 by log-rank test). When DM and non-DM
   patients were analyzed separately, a significant association of lower
   hematocrit levels with higher mortality disappeared in DM patients (p =
   0.6280), in contrast with its retention in non-DM counterparts (p <
   0.0001). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models
   demonstrated a significant association between hematocrit with all-cause
   mortality in non-DM patients after adjustment for age, gender, BMI,
   hemodialysis duration, SBP, DBP, albumin, total cholesterol, calcium,
   phosphorus, and intact PTH (p = 0.046), whereas this association
   disappeared in DM patients in the same model (p = 0.583). In conclusion,
   these results suggested that the association between anemia and higher
   mortality disappeared in DM hemodialysis patients, in contrast with
   non-DM counterparts. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with the
   development of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and CKD and vascular
   disease are etiologically linked. Evidence suggests deficiencies of
   vitamins D and K may adversely affect the cardiovascular system, but
   data from longitudinal studies are lacking. We hypothesized that
   deficiencies of vitamins D and K may be associated with incident CKD
   and/or incident albuminuria amongst members of the general population.
   Methods: We analyzed 1,442 Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age
   58 years; 50.5\% women), free of CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), with a
   mean follow-up of 7.8 years in 2005-2008. Incident albuminuria was
   defined using sex-specific cut-offs of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
   (>= 17 mg/g men and >= 25 mg/g women). Baseline log plasma phylloquinone
   (vitamin K-1) and 25(OH) D levels, analyzed as continuous variables and
   by quartile, were related to risk of incident CKD (n = 108) and incident
   albuminuria (n = 106) using logistic regression models adjusted for
   standard risk factors. Results: Participants in the highest
   phylloquinone quartile (>= 1.78 nmol/l) had an increased risk of CKD
   (multivariable-adjusted OR Q(4) vs. Q(1) 2.39; p = 0.006) and
   albuminuria at follow-up (multivariable-adjusted OR Q(4) vs. Q(1) 1.95;
   p = 0.05), whereas no association was observed with continuous
   phylloquinone levels for either endpoint. Deficiency of 25(OH) D was not
   associated with incident CKD or albuminuria in either analysis.
   Conclusions: Contrary to our hypothesis, higher plasma phylloquinone
   levels are associated with an increased risk of incident CKD. Whether
   plasma phylloquinone is a marker for another unmeasured risk factor
   requires further study. External validation is necessary given the
   unexpected nature of these results. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {{Vascular calcifications (VCs) and renal osteodystrophy (ROD) are
   frequently seen together and represent the major causes of morbidity and
   mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Some studies suggest a
   pathogenic link between them, but there is no consensus as yet regarding
   this issue. The main objective of our study was to establish whether
   there is any relation between VCs and ROD in our HD patients. We
   evaluated the prevalence of VCs and ROD and the relationship between VCs
   and some clinical and biochemical characteristics of HD patients.
   We examined radiological signs of VCs and ROD on hands and pelvis bone
   radiographs in 81 chronic HD patients, and we calculated a VC score on
   this basis.
   We found a significant relation between radiological signs of ROD and
   those of VC (P = 0.019). The patients with ROD had a higher mean VC
   score (P = 0.02). By linear regression, the VC score correlated directly
   with serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), intact parathyroid hormone
   (iPTH) and CaxP product and inversely with serum albumin. The logistic
   regression model revealed that ROD, male gender and treatment with
   calcium salts were predictive of VCs development. There were no
   associations between VCs and age, HD vintage, diabetes, dialysate Ca
   concentration, vitamin D treatment, spKt/V, URR and C-reactive protein
   (CRP) levels.
   There seems to be a pathogenetic link between bone and artery diseases
   in chronic HD patients. Both VCs and ROD have a high prevalence. ROD,
   male gender and treatment with calcium salts are risk factors for VCs.}},

Abstract = {{Background. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), disorders of
   mineral metabolism are associated with vascular calcifications and
   mortality. Microvascular dysfunction, by affecting flow resistance and
   tissue perfusion, may explain the cardiovascular sequelae of
   CKD-associated disorders of mineral metabolism. We investigated whether
   advanced CKD is associated with a decrease in the functional and
   structural number of capillaries in skin and subsequently whether
   capillary rarefaction is related to mineral metabolism.
   Methods. Capillary density was measured by nailfold microscopy in 19
   predialysis and 35 CKD Stage 5 (CKD5) patients and 19 controls. In CKD
   patients, calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitaminD3
   (25vitD3) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitaminD3 (1,25vitD3) were analysed as well.
   Results. Capillary density at baseline was 42 +/- 15/mm(2) in
   predialysis patients, 45 +/- 17/mm(2) in CKD5 patients and 56 +/-
   20/mm(2) in controls (patients versus controls, respectively, P < 0.05
   and P = 0.05). Absolute capillary recruitment during post-occlusive
   reactive hyperaemia was 17 +/- 7/mm(2), 14 +/- 6/mm(2) and 23 +/-
   8/mm(2), respectively (P < 0.05 for both patients and controls).
   Capillary density during venous occlusion was 59 +/- 20/mm(2), 59 +/-
   21/mm(2) and 77 +/- 21/mm(2), respectively (P < 0.05 for both patients
   and controls). In multiple regression analysis, both serum phosphorus
   and bicarbonate values were independently and inversely associated with
   capillary density at baseline (r(2) of model 19\%) as well as during
   venous occlusion (r(2) of model 28\%). Furthermore, both serum
   phosphorus and bicarbonate were inversely and female gender positively
   correlated with capillary density during recruitment (r(2) of model
   37\%).
   Conclusion. Advanced CKD is characterized by an impaired functional and
   structural capillary density in skin, which is related to both high
   phosphorus and bicarbonate values.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a cytokine that
   regulates bone resorption, has been implicated in the process of
   vascular calcification and stiffness.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements Serum OPG was measured in
   351 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from one site of the
   Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. Cortical bone mineral content
   (BMC) was measured by quantitative computed tomography in the tibia.
   Multivariable linear regression was used to test the association between
   serum OPG and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, measures of
   abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and pulse wave velocity.
   Results Higher serum OPG levels were associated with older age, female
   gender, greater systolic BP, lower estimated GFR, and lower serum
   albumin. OPG was not associated with measures of abnormal bone or
   mineral metabolism including serum phosphorus, albumin-corrected serum
   calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase,
   or cortical BMC. Among 226 participants with concurrent aortic pulse
   wave velocity measurements, increasing tertiles of serum OPG were
   associated with higher aortic pulse wave velocity after adjustment for
   demographics, traditional vascular risk factors, and nontraditional risk
   factors such as estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum phosphate, corrected
   serum calcium, presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, serum albumin,
   and C-reactive protein or after additional adjustment for cortical BMC

Abstract = {{Vascular calcification is accelerated during dialysis and is known to be
   an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Progression of
   aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can be simply estimated with an AoAC
   score (AoACS) using plain chest radiography. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate risk factors for AoAC progression. The enrolled subjects
   were 125 newly treated hemodialysis patients and 59 peritoneal dialysis
   patients. In the patients who had undergone chest radiography before
   initial dialysis therapy and every year, we estimated AoACS and then
   divided the patients into two groups based on the presence or absence of
   AoAC progression. We also compared the baseline clinical and biochemical
   profiles in the two groups. Eighty-five (46.2\%) were men (mean age,
   58.6 +/- 12.7 years). Seventy-six patients (41.3\%) had AoAC before
   initial dialysis, with a mean AoACS of 13.0 +/- 20.4\%. The mean
   duration of follow-up was 2.7 +/- 1.0 years. Half of the patients (50\%)
   had progressive AoAC. Age > 65 years (p = 0.003), dialysis duration (p =
   0.004), diabetes (p = 0.015), and the presence of AoAC at baseline (p =
   0.001) were related to AoAC progression. No significant association was
   found between AoAC progression and the baseline clinical parameters,
   including gender, obesity, hypertension, and dialysis modality. In a
   multivariate analysis, dialysis duration (p = 0.003) and the presence of
   AoAC at baseline (p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for AoAC
   progression in patients undergoing dialysis. The duration of dialysis
   and the presence of AoAC before initial dialysis were significantly
   related to the progression of AoAC in these patients. The results
   suggest that patients should be carefully managed from the predialysis
   stage to prevent AoAC progression and to reduce cardiovascular
   morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives End-stage renal disease is linked to
   alterations in thyroid hormone levels and/or metabolism, resulting in a
   high prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism and low triiodothyronine
   (T3) levels. These alterations are involved in endothelial damage,
   cardiac abnormalities, and inflammation, but the exact mechanisms are
   unclear. In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum
   free-T3 (fT3) and carotid artery atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness,
   and vascular calcification in prevalent patients on conventional
   hemodialysis.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements 137 patients were
   included. Thyroid-hormone levels were determined by chemiluminescent
   immunoassay, carotid artery intima media thickness (CA-IMT) by Doppler
   ultrasonography, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (c-f PWV), and
   augmentation index by Sphygrnocor device, and coronary artery
   calcification (CAC) scores by multi-slice computerized tomography.
   Results Mean fT3 level was 3.70 +/- 1.23 pmol/L. Across decreasing fT3
   tertiles, c-f PWV and CA-IMT values were incrementally higher, whereas
   CACs were not different. In adjusted ordinal logistic regression
   analysis, fT3 level (odds ratio, 0.81; 95\% confidence interval, 0.68 to
   0.97), age, and interdialytic weight gain were significantly associated
   with CA-IMT. fT3 level was associated with c-f PWV in nondiabetics but
   not in diabetics. In nondiabetics (11 = 113), c-f PWV was positively
   associated with age and systolic BP but negatively with fT3 levels (odds
   ratio = 0.57, 95\% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.83).
   Conclusions fT3 levels are inversely associated with carotid
   atherosclerosis but not with CAC in hemodialysis patients. Also, fT3
   levels are inversely associated with surrogates of arterial stiffness in
   nondiabetics. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 6: 2240-2246, 2011.

Abstract = {{Background: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) for hemodialysis frequently
   fail to mature because of inadequate dilation or early stenosis. The
   pathogenesis of AVF nonmaturation may be related to pre-existing
   vascular pathologic states: medial fibrosis or microcalcification may
   limit arterial dilation, and intimal hyperplasia may cause stenosis.
   Study Design: Observational study.
   Setting \& Participants: Patients with chronic kidney disease (N = 50)
   undergoing AVF placement. Predictors: Medial fibrosis,
   microcalcification, and intimal hyperplasia in arteries and veins
   obtained during AVF creation.
   Outcome \& Measurements: AVF nonmaturation.
   Results: AVF nonmaturation occurred in 38\% of patients despite
   attempted salvage procedures. Preoperative arterial diameter was
   associated with upper-arm AVF maturation (P = 0.007). Medial fibrosis
   was similar in patients with nonmaturing and mature AVFs (60\% +/- 14\%
   vs 66\% +/- 13\%; P = 0.2). AVF nonmaturation was not associated with
   patient age or diabetes, although both variables were associated
   significantly with severe medial fibrosis. Conversely, AVF nonmaturation
   was higher in women than men despite similar medial fibrosis in both
   sexes. Arterial microcalcification (assessed semiquantitatively) tended
   to be associated with AVF nonmaturation (1.3 +/- 0.8 vs 0.9 +/- 0.8; P =
   0.08). None of the arteries or veins obtained at AVF creation had
   intimal hyperplasia. However, repeated venous samples obtained in 6
   patients during surgical revision of an immature AVF showed venous
   neointimal hyperplasia.
   Limitations: Single-center study.
   Conclusion: Medial fibrosis and microcalcification are frequent in
   arteries used to create AVFs, but do not explain AVF nonmaturation.
   Unlike previous studies, intimal hyperplasia was not present at
   baseline, but developed de novo in nonmaturing AVFs. Am J Kidney Dis.

Abstract = {{Background. The purpose of this study was to report the evolution of
   coronary artery calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic kidney
   disease Stages 3 and 4 comparing those with and without diabetes. We
   previously reported prevalence in the same population.
   Methods. CAC was measured using multi-slice computer tomography. We
   prospectively followed up 103 patients for 2 years, 49 with diabetes and
   54 without diabetes. Demographic, routine biochemistry, calcification
   inhibitors and bone mineral density data were collected and analysed.
   Evolution of CAC was defined as those with a difference of >= 2.5 U
   between baseline and final square root CAC scores.
   Results. There were more progressors in the group with diabetes, 24
   compared to 12 in the group without diabetes (P = 0.004). When diabetes
   was present, CAC progressed equally in men and women. Risk factors for
   evolution of CAC included age, baseline CAC score and serum phosphate
   levels. Baseline CAC score, phosphate and body mass index were
   independent predictors for the increase of CAC score during the study
   period. Severity of CAC was greater in the diabetes group (median CAC
   score at baseline in the group with diabetes 154 increased to 258 2
   years later, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions. Evolution of CAC is greater in older patients and those
   with diabetes, where the gender advantage of being female is lost. Serum
   phosphate level, despite being within the normal range and virtually no
   use of phosphate binders, was also a risk factor. Further studies are
   required to determine the levels of serum phosphate required to minimize
   cardiovascular risk.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Vitamin D may promote cardiovascular health in general
   population and in chronic kidney disease (CKD) through inhibition of the
   renin-angiotensin system and anti-inflammatory effects. Although
   proteinuria is a marker of kidney and cardiovascular disease, few
   studies have examined vitamin D levels, inflammation, and proteinuria
   simultaneously in CKD. We evaluated the relationship between calcidiol
   (25D), calcitriol (1,25D), inflammation, and albuminuria in Study of
   Early Evaluation of Kidney Disease, a multicenter CKD cohort.
   Design: A cross-sectional study was carried out.
   Participants: A total of 1,847 participants were studied, of which 387
   were randomly selected for inflammatory biomarker assessment.
   Predictors and Outcomes: The primary predictors were 25D and 1,25D. The
   outcome was albuminuria (urine albumin to creatinine ratio {[}UACR]: >30
   mg/g).
   Results: Albuminuric patients were more likely to have decreased 25D and
   1,25D levels and higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels compared with
   normoalbuminuric patients. The lowest tertiles of 25D and 1,25D were
   associated with 2 to 3 times increased odds of albuminuria compared with
   the highest tertiles when adjusted for age, gender, race, systolic blood
   pressure, and diabetes (OR for 25D: 3.0; 95\% CI: 1.3 to 7.0; OR for
   1,25D: 2.6; 95\% CI: 1.7 to 3.9). In analogous linear regression models,
   25D and 1,25D were significantly associated with log UACR (P<.0001, for
   both). In participants for whom inflammatory markers were measured,
   demographics-adjusted linear regression models that included IL-6
   described attenuation of the relationship between 25D, 1,25D, and UACR.
   Conclusions: Low 25D and 1,25D levels are independently associated with
   albuminuria. IL-6 may be an important intermediary between vitamin D
   deficiency and albuminuria, or vitamin D deficiency may contribute to
   inflammation and subsequent albuminuria. (C) 2011 by the National Kidney

Abstract = {{We have already demonstrated that in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients,
   the cyclic variations in both hydration status and blood pressure are
   responsible for changes in pulse wave velocity (PWV). The aim of this
   study is to verify whether the cyclic variation of PWV influences
   mortality in dialysis patients. We studied 167 oligoanuric (urinary
   output < 500 mL/day) patients on chronic standard bicarbonate HD for at
   least 6 months. They performed 3 HD sessions of 4 hours per week.
   Patients were classified into 3 groups: normal PWV before and after
   dialysis (LL); high PWV before and normal PWV after dialysis (HL); and
   high PWV before and after dialysis (HH). The carotid-femoral PWV was
   measured with an automated system using the foot-to-foot method.
   Analysis of variance was used to compare the different groups. The
   outcome event studied was all-cause mortality and cardiovascular
   mortality. The PWV values observed were LL in 44 patients (26.3\%); HL
   in 53 patients (31.8\%); and HH in 70 patients (41.9\%). The 3 groups of
   patients are homogenous for sex, age, and blood pressure. The HH group
   had a higher prevalence of (P < 0.001) ASCVD. It is interesting that the
   distribution of patients in the 3 groups is correlated with the basal
   value of PWV. In fact, when the basal measure of PWV is elevated, there
   is a higher probability that an HD session cannot reduce PWV (< 12 ms).
   A total of 53 patients (31.7\%) died during the follow-up of 2 years: 5
   patients in the LL group (11.4\%); 16 in the HL group (30.2\%); and 32
   in the HH group (50.7\%) (LL vs. HL, P=0.047; LL vs. HH, P < 0.00001; HL
   vs. HH, P=0.034). We evidence for the first time that different
   behaviors of PWV in dialysis subjects determine differences in
   mortality.}},

   were recorded in urethane-anesthetized animals {[}12-wk-old hypertensive
   female LPK rats (n = 5)] before the onset of end-stage renal disease and
   their age-and sex-matched normotensive controls (Lewis, n = 6). Animals
   were euthanized, and the aorta was collected to measure calcium content
   by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. A separate cohort of animals (n
   = 5/group) were anesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium and pressure
   perfused with formalin, and the aorta was collected for
   histomorphometry, which allowed calculation of aortic wall thickness,
   medial cross-sectional area (MCSA), elastic modulus (EM), and wall
   stress (WS), size and density of smooth muscle nuclei, and relative
   content of lamellae, interlamellae elastin, and collagen. Mean arterial
   pressure (MAP) and PWV were significantly greater in the LPK compared
   with Lewis (72 and 33\%, respectively) animals. The LPK group had
   6.8-fold greater aortic calcification, 38\% greater aortic MCSA, 56\%
   greater EM/WS, 13\% greater aortic wall thickness, 21\% smaller smooth
   muscle cell area, and 20\% less elastin density with no difference in

   and increased calcification with a functional increase in PWV and
   therefore aortic stiffness in hypertensive LPK rats.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives Low bone mineral density and coronary artery
   calcification (CAC) are highly prevalent among chronic kidney disease
   (CKD) patients, and both conditions are strongly associated with higher
   mortality. The study presented here aimed to investigate whether reduced
   vertebral bone density (VBD) was associated with the presence of CAC in
   the earlier stages of CKD.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements Seventy-two nondialyzed
   CKD patients (age 52 +/- 11.7 years, 70\% male, 42\% diabetics,
   creatinine clearance 40.4 +/- 18.2 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) were studied.
   VBD and CAC were quantified by computed tomography.
   Results CAC > 10 Agatston units (AU) was observed in 50\% of the
   patients (median 120 AU {[}interquartile range 32 to 584 AU]), and a
   calcification score >= 400 AU was found in 19\% (736 {[}527 to 1012]
   AU). VBD (190 +/- 52 Hounsfield units) correlated inversely with age (r
   = -0.41, P < 0.001) and calcium score (r = -0.31, P = 0.01), and no
   correlation was found with gender, creatinine clearance, proteinuria,
   lipid profile, mineral parameters, body mass index, and diabetes.
   Patients in the lowest tertile of VBD had expressively increased calcium
   score in comparison to the middle and highest tertile groups. In the
   multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounding
   variables, low VBD was independently associated with the presence of
   CAC.
   Conclusions Low VBD was associated with CAC in nondialyzed CKD patients.
   The authors suggest that low VBD might constitute another nontraditional

Abstract = {{Introduction: Arterial stiffness is a risk marker for cardiovascular
   events. In this study we aimed to compare the effect on calcineurin
   inhibitors (CNI) and mammalian Target of Rapamycine inhibitors (mTORi)
   on arterial stiffness in renal transplant patients. Patients and
   methods: 81 renal transplant patients under CNI-based or mTORi-based
   protocol for at least 6 months were included in the study. Arterial
   stiffness was measured by using the SphygmoCor device (AtCor Medical,
   Sydney, Australia). Vitamin K-dependent, calcification inhibitor matrix
   Gla protein (MGP) concentrations were quantified by ELISA methods
   (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria). Results: 34 patients were on mTORi-based
   and 47 on CNI-based immunosuppression. Mean age was 37.9 +/- 10.8 (18 -
   71) years and 45\% were female. Age, gender, graft functions and
   follow-up period of the groups were similar. Augmentation index was 15.2
   +/- 12.6\% in CNI and 18.8 +/- 14.0\% in mTORi groups (p > 0.05). There
   was no difference regarding carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity between
   groups. Arterial stiffness was positively correlated with age, total
   cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and
   proteinuria. MGP levels were higher in the mTORi group but were not
   predictors for carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Conclusion: Rather

Abstract = {{Background. Mineral metabolism parameters may play a role in the
   survival of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   Methods. In the CORES Study, we analysed the association between
   calcium, phosphorus and PTH and mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular)
   in 16 173 haemodialysis (HD) patients over 18 years from six Latin
   American countries, who underwent haemodialysis up to 54 months.
   Unadjusted, case-mix-adjusted and time-dependent multivariable-adjusted
   hazard ratio (HR) of death were calculated for categories of serum
   albumin-corrected calcium (Ca-Alb), phosphorus and PTH using as
   `reference values' the range in which the lowest death rate was
   observed. Age, gender, vitamin D treatment, diabetes, vintage, vascular
   access, weight, blood pressure and laboratory variables (serum albumin,
   haemoglobin, creatinine, ferritin and Kt/V) were used as confounding
   variables.
   Results. Low (<9.5 mg/dL) and high (>10.5 mg/dL) CaAlb increased the HR
   for all-cause mortality. Low (<9.0 mg/dL) Ca-Alb increased the HR for
   cardiovascular mortality. High phosphorus (>5.5 mg/dL) increased the HR
   for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Low phosphorus (<4.0
   and <3.0 mg/dL) increased the HR for both all-cause and cardiovascular
   mortality. Furthermore, low (<150 pg/mL) and high (>500 and >300 pg/mL)
   PTH increased the HR for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In
   addition, only phosphorus >6.0 mg/dL increased the HR for cardiovascular
   hospitalizations. No effect was observed with Ca-Alb or PTH.
   Conclusions. In summary, in 16 173 HD patients, elevated and reduced
   serum levels of albumin-corrected calcium, phosphorus and PTH levels
   were associated with increments in all-cause mortality. Similar results

Abstract = {{A high circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level may be a risk factor for

   who were prospectively followed for 6 years. In long-term

   A high circulating OPG level is reported to be a risk factor for
   vascular calcification and mortality in Western chronic kidney disease
   (CKD) patients but it is not known if this is true for Japanese CKD
   patients, where a different risk profile may operate.
   OPG and PWV were measured at baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term
   (> 3 years) Japanese hemodialysis patients (median age 62 years) who
   were prospectively followed for 6 years.
   OPG levels were associated in multivariate analysis with age, dialysis
   vintage, history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and parathyroid hormone
   levels. C-reactive protein levels did not correlate with OPG. Patients
   with clinical history of CVD had significantly higher OPG levels and OPG
   levels were positively correlated to PWV, an index of arterial
   stiffness. These associations were independent of age, sex, dialysis
   vintage, and diabetes. During the follow-up period, 40 deaths, including
   25 cardiovascular deaths, were recorded. In crude analysis, each unit of
   increase in OPG was associated with increased all-cause (hazard ratios
   1.14, 95\% confidence interval 1.08-1.20) and CVD mortality (1.14

Abstract = {{Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in CKD and leads to
   increased vascular stiffness and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors include abnormal bone
   turnover and/or dysregulation of the calcification inhibitors, although
   their relative contribution remains unclear. We investigated the
   association between bone turnover, the calcification inhibitors (matrix
   gla protein; MGP and Fetuin-A), and the phosphate regulating hormone;
   fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and arterial stiffness in
   pre-dialysis CKD patients. One hundred and forty-five patients with CKD
   stages 1-4 (74 M, 71 F) aged (mean {[}SD]) 53 {[}14] years were studied.
   Bone turnover markers (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and
   tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)) and MGP, Fetuin-A and
   FGF-23 were determined. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS),
   femoral neck (FN), forearm (FARM) and total hip (TH). Arterial stiffness
   was assessed by contour analysis of digital volume pulse (SI(DVP)).
   There was a significant positive correlation between TRACP:BALP ratio
   and SI(DVP) ( r = 0.19, p = 0.023). Following multi-linear regression
   analysis. significant associations were seen between serum BALP (p =
   0.037), TRACP (p = 0.009) and TRACP:BALP ratio (p = 0.001) and SI(DVP)
   independently of traditional CVD risk factors. No significant
   relationship between SI(DVP) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 was observed.
   A significant negative correlation was seen between BMD at the FARM and
   SI(DVP) in CKD stage 4 (r = -0.35, p = 0.024). The association remained
   significant following correction for age, gender and cardiovascular risk
   factors (p = 0.029). Our data suggest a link between imbalances in bone
   turnover and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD. Longitudinal
   studies are needed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of these bone
   turnover markers as predictors of CVD in CKD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains asymptomatic until its
   late stage, and also significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular
   (CV) disease morbidity and mortality. However, information in scant on
   the prevalence of CKD, and its association with subclinical
   atherosclerosis as depicted by carotid intima media thickness (IMT) in
   younger adults.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1193 participants (43\%
   males, 30\% blacks) aged 23 to 43 years, residing in the semi-rural
   biracial (black-white) community of Bogalusa, Louisiana. The measured
   variables include estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to
   determine functional renal changes and urine album creatinine ratio to
   diagnose albuminuria, along with CV risk factor variables, and both
   segmental and composite carotid IMT.
   RESULTS: Ninety-nine (8.5\%) subjects had CKD, with blacks showing
   higher prevalence than whites (p = .01). Subjects with albuminuria had
   significantly greater internal carotid IMT (p = .03), common carotid IMT
   (p = .005), and composite carotid IMT (p = .04) than those without. In
   the multivariate logistic regression model, albuminuria was associated
   with black race (odds ratio {[}OR], 1.92; p = .005), female gender (OR,
   2.24; p = .002), diabetes (OR, 6.26; p < .001), hypertension (OR, 2.36;
   p < .001), obesity (OR, 1.73; p = 0.02), and composite carotid IMT (OR,
   1.83; p = .02), after adjusting for age. However, reduction in eGFR did
   not show significant independent association with carotid IMT.
   CONCLUSION: Among asymptomatic young adults, subclinical atherosclerosis
   and structural renal damage depicted by albuminuria coexist, which has
   implications for early prevention and control. Ann Epidemiol

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Higher serum phosphate levels are associated with adverse clinical
   outcomes across the spectrum of kidney function. Recent epidemiologic
   studies have focused on identifying potential mechanisms of these
   associations as well as risk factors for increased serum phosphate in
   the general population.
   Recent findings
   Higher serum phosphate levels were independently associated with
   coronary artery calcification, vascular stiffness, left ventricular
   hypertrophy, and carotid artery disease, even among individuals with
   normal kidney function and serum phosphate levels within the normal
   range. Interestingly, effect modification was observed by gender in
   older populations, with the strength of these associations being weaker
   in women than in men. In addition, socioeconomic status, sex hormone
   levels, and common genetic variants were found to be independent
   predictors of serum phosphate levels, suggesting that common demographic
   and biological factors may predispose to higher serum phosphate in the
   general population.
   Summary
   The association of increased serum phosphate with adverse outcomes may
   be mediated by a link between higher serum phosphate and subclinical
   vascular disease. Common environmental and biological factors may
   modulate these relationships, with potentially important implications
   for designing future interventional studies meant to assess the effect
   of lowering serum phosphate on long-term outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Our study was performed to analyze risk factors for coronary
   artery calcification (CAC) and valvular calcification (VC) in
   peritoneally dialyzed patients, as well as the frequency of fatal
   cardiovascular complications.
   METHODS: The study was performed on 102 peritoneal dialyzed patients
   (mean time of dialysis: 37.3 +/- 23 months). Patients were divided
   depending on the severity of calcification into three groups: A, lack of
   calcification; B, CAC up to 400 mm(3); and C, CAC > 400 mm(3). CAC and
   VC were measured by means of computed tomography. The following risk
   factors for CAC and VC were analyzed: age, gender, time of peritoneal
   dialysis, and levels of calcium, phosphates, calcium x phosphorus
   product (Ca x P), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, fetuin-A, and
   parathormone (PTH).
   RESULTS: Positive correlation was found between CAC and VC expressed by
   Agatston and volumetric score, and serum levels of CRP and fibrinogen
   and patient age. In patients with CAC and VC, serum levels of phosphorus
   and Ca x P were significantly higher; however, such significance was not
   observed in patients with CAC only. Serum fetuin-A was decreased in all
   study groups, and was significantly lower in patients with CAC and VC
   than in patients with CAC only. Cardiovascular complications were
   significantly more frequent and mortality was higher in group C than in
   groups A and B.
   CONCLUSIONS: In peritoneally dialyzed patients, CAC accompanied by VC is
   a high risk factor for mortality resulting from cardiovascular
   complications.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Vascular calcifications are frequent in Stage 5 chronic
   kidney disease (CKD-5) patients receiving haemodialysis. The current
   study was designed to evaluate the associations between bone
   turnover/volume and coronary artery calcifications (CAC).
   Methods. In 207 CKD-5 patients, bone biopsies, multi-slice computed
   tomography of the coronary arteries and blood drawings for relevant
   biochemical parameters were done. The large number of CKD-5 patients
   enrolled allowed separate evaluation of patients with CAC versus
   patients without CAC and adjustment for traditional and non-traditional
   risk factors for CAC.
   Results. When all patients were analysed, associations were found
   between CAC and bone turnover, bone volume, age, gender and dialysis
   vintage. When only patients with CAC were included, there was a U-shaped
   relationship between CAC and bone turnover, whilst the association with
   bone volume was lost. In these patients, the relationship of CAC with
   age, gender and dialysis vintage remained.
   Conclusions. Beyond the non-modifiable risk factors of age, gender and
   dialysis vintage, these data show that bone abnormalities of renal
   osteodystrophy amenable to treatment should be considered in the
   management of patients with CAC.}},

   disease is unclear. We examined 46 autopsy patients who had undergone
   hemodialysis, and age and sex-matched 46 patients with cardiovascular
   disease and an eGFR of > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. There was no difference in
   the prevalence of diabetes or hypertension between the groups. We
   divided the aorta into four segments: A, ascending artery to arch; B,
   descending artery to diaphragm; C, suprarenal; and D, infrarenal. We
   used the classification of the American Heart Association to evaluate
   atherosclerosis progression. Distribution was scored by the extent to
   which each segment was damaged: 0, none; 1, less than 1/3; 2, more than
   1/3 to less than 2/3; 3, more than 2/3. Histological examination
   revealed that the progression score (P < 0.05) and distribution score (P
   < 0.005) were more severe in the hemodialysis group, especially in
   segment A. Regression analysis showed that atherosclerosis of segment A
   was related to age, gender, dyslipidemia, smoking, hemodialysis therapy,
   and hemodialysis duration. In hemodialysis patients, atherosclerotic

Abstract = {{Aim: Vascular calcification is a cause of cardiovascular death in
   hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate
   the relationship between the progression of aortic arch calcification
   (AoAC) and serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-23.
   Methods: The enrolled study subjects were 127 (83 men and 44 women) HD
   patients. Calcification of the aortic arch was semiquantitatively
   estimated with a score (AoACS) on plain chest radiology. Change in AoACS
   (Delta AoACS) was obtained by subtracting the baseline AoACS value from
   the follow- up AoACS value. The second assessment was performed from 5
   years after the first determination.
   Results: The percentage of male gender in non-progressors (58.5\%) was
   lesser than in regressors (60.0\%) and progressors (74.6\%). In
   addition, the dialysis duration in regressors (14.1 +/- 5.1 years) was
   shorter than in non-progressors (19.5 +/- 7.0 years) and progressors
   (16.8 +/- 7.5 years). Interestingly, the serum FGF-23 level in
   regressors (39225.5 +/- 9247.9 pg/mL) was significantly higher than in
   non-progressors (12896.5 +/- 26323.5 pg/ mL) and progressors (14062.4
   +/- 18456.8 pg/mL). Multiple regression analyses showed male gender
   (beta value = 0.969, F = 5.092, p = 0.0192), serum levels of albumin
   (beta value =-1.395, F = 4.541, p = 0.0296) and log FGF-23 (beta value
   =-0.001, F = 7.273, p = 0.0115) to be significant independent
   determinants of Delta AoACS.
   Conclusion: Changes in AoAC evaluated by using a simple chest radiograph
   are associated with serum FGF-23 levels. Excess accumulation of FGF-23
   in serum may enable to inhibit the calcification process in vessel walls
   in chronic HD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Low levels of circulating fetuin-A are associated with
   increased mortality in dialysis patients. This study aimed to examine a
   potential causative role for fetuin-A on mortality by investigating
   whether a functional polymorphism in the alpha2-Heremans-Schmid
   glycoprotein (AHSG) gene associates with mortality, and by estimating
   the causative effect of fetuin-A levels on mortality using a Mendelian
   randomization design.
   Methods. One thousand and forty-three incident dialysis patients were
   genotyped for the Thr256Ser polymorphism (rs4918) and followed up for 5
   years; in 549 patients, serum fetuin-A levels were measured.
   Results. Carriers of a serine allele displayed lower fetuin-A levels
   (-0.07 g/L per allele, P < 0.001). A small increased mortality risk was
   observed for the Thr/Ser and Ser/Ser genotype compared with the Thr/Thr
   genotype (HR 1.03, 95\% CI 0.83-1.28 and HR 1.10, 95\% CI 0.78-1.55,
   respectively). Using the AHSG genotype as an instrumental variable, the
   causative HR of fetuin-A levels on mortality was estimated as 1.01 per
   0.1-g/L increase. Inflammation and diabetes partially modified the
   association of fetuin-A levels with outcome.
   Conclusions. The Thr256Ser polymorphism was weakly associated with
   mortality, and no causative effect of fetuin-A levels on this outcome
   was observed. Other risk factors, including inflammation and diabetes,
   might lead to lower fetuin-A levels, and/or modify the effect of low
   fetuin-A on mortality in end-stage renal disease patients.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: A very low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (VLPL) is
   associated with an increased risk of adynamic bone disease, vascular
   calcification, and mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of
   the study was to assess the frequency, the associated factors, and the
   prognosis of nonsurgical VLPL in a cohort of prevalent HD patients.
   Methods: In July 2005, a cross-sectional study was performed on the
   French ARNOS cohort in 1,348 prevalent HD patients from 24 dialysis
   centres in the Rhone-Alpes area. Patients with a baseline intact PTH
   level <50 pg/ml (VLPL, Group 1) and 6 50 pg/ml (Group 2) were compared
   and a 42-month survival analysis was performed. Patients with prevalent
   or incident parathyroidectomy were excluded. Results: We studied 1,138
   prevalent HD patients. As compared to patients of Group 2 (n = 1,019),
   patients with VLPL (Group 1, n = 119) had lower serum albumin levels
   (34.5 +/- 5 vs. 36.4 +/- 5 g/l, p < 0.0001), less protein intake (nPCR
   0.99 +/- 0.28 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.28 g/kg/day, p = 0.01), higher calcaemia
   (2.30 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.26 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.01) and were more
   frequently treated with calcium carbonate (67 vs. 54\%, p < 0.001).
   Patients with VLPL had a higher mortality rate (HR: 1.4 (1.07-1.8), p =
   0.006) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, and dialysis vintage.
   The odds ratios of mortality for patients with VLPL remained higher in
   all calcaemia and serum albumin quartiles. Only 3/119 patients in Group
   1 did not receive any PTH-lowering therapies (i.e. calcium carbonate
   (67\%), alfacalcidol (38\%), cinacalcet (10.1\%), and dialysate calcium
   >= 1.5 mmol/l (94\%)). Conclusion: In this observational French cohort,
   VLPL was observed in 10\% of prevalent HD patients and was associated
   with poor survival rates. An inadequate therapeutic strategy could be
   responsible for this observation. The real consequences of this
   iatrogenic adynamic bone disease remain hypothetical, but it may be
   related to the risk of developing vascular calcification. It is
   hypothesized that a more adequate strategy, using fewer PTH-lowering
   therapies in cases of VLPL, may help in improving the poor prognosis.

Abstract = {{Objective-The goal of this study was to compare and contrast coronary
   artery calcium (CAC) with abdominal aortic calcium (AAC) in terms of
   their associations with traditional and novel cardiovascular disease
   (CVD) risk factors.
   Methods and Results-We measured both AAC and CAC using computed
   tomography scans in 1974 men and women aged 45 to 84 years from a
   multiethnic cohort. Traditional and novel CVD risk factors were examined
   separately in relation to AAC and CAC, using logistic regression for
   qualitative categorical comparisons and multiple linear regression for
   quantitative continuous comparisons. AAC was significantly associated
   with cigarette smoking and dyslipidemia and showed no gender difference.
   In contrast, CAC showed much weaker associations with smoking and
   dyslipidemia and a strong male predominance. Age and hypertension were
   associated similarly and significantly with AAC and CAC. Novel risk
   factors generally showed no independent association with either calcium
   measure, although in subset analyses, phosphorus, but not calcium, was
   related to CAC. The receiver operating characteristic curves for the
   qualitative results and the r(2) values for the quantitative analyses
   were both much higher for AAC than for CAC.
   Conclusion-AAC showed stronger correlations with most CVD risk factors
   than did CAC. The predictive value of AAC compared with CAC for incident
   CVD events remains to be evaluated. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol.

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney
   disease (CKD) is explained in part by traditional cardiovascular risk
   factors; by uremia-specific factors; and by abnormalities of mineral
   metabolism, factors involved in its regulation, and in the vascular
   calcification process.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements: In an unselected
   population of 177 patients with calculated GFR (eGFR) between 90 and 30
   ml/min per 1.73 m(2), the link between the mineral metabolism
   abnormalities (calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product),
   regulatory factors (parathyroid hormone {[}PTH], intact PTH vitamin D,
   fibroblast growth factor 23 {[}FGF 23], and fetuin A), and the severity
   of coronary artery disease (CAD) assessed by coronary angiography were
   evaluated in three subgroups defined by tertiles of Gensini lesion
   severity score.
   Results: The mean serum values for FGF 23 in the entire study population
   was 28.1 +/- 17.3 RU/ml and for fetuin A was 473.1 +/- 156.2 mu g/ml.
   Patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) had significantly higher
   values of FGF 23 compared with patients with eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73
   m(2). The Gensini score values significantly correlated with gender;
   arterial hypertension; and HDL cholesterol, eGFR, iPTH, FGF 23, and
   fetuin A levels. After the adjustments for traditional and
   uremia-related cardiovascular risk factors, the FGF 23 and fetuin A
   remained significant predictors of the Gensini score.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that in a relatively young population
   with mild-to-moderate alteration of kidney function and with less
   traditional cardiovascular risk factors, anomalies of the serum FGF 23
   and fetuin A levels appear early in the course of disease and are
   independent major predictors for extent of CAD. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 5:

Abstract = {{Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has been suggested to play a role
   in vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease. Common carotid
   artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) assessment and common carotid
   artery (CCA) plaque identification using ultrasound are well-recognized
   tools for identification and monitoring of atherosclerosis. The aim of
   this study was to test that elevated FGF-23 levels might be associated
   with carotid artery atherosclerosis in maintenance hemodialysis (HD)
   patients. In this cross-sectional study, plasma FGF-23 concentrations
   were measured using a C-terminal human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   kit. Carotid artery intima-media thickness was measured and CCA plaques
   were identified by B-Mode Doppler ultrasound. One hundred twenty-eight
   maintenance HD patients (65 women and 63 men, mean age: 55.5 +/- 13
   years, mean HD vintage: 52 +/- 10 months, all patients are on HD thrice
   a week) were involved. The mean CIMT were higher with increasing
   tertiles of plasma FGF-23 levels (0.66 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.75 +/- 0.05 vs.
   0.86 +/- 0.20mm, P<0.0001). Log plasma FGF-23 were higher in patients
   with plaques in CCA than patients free of plaques (3.0 +/- 0.17 vs. 2.7
   +/- 0.23, P<0.0001). Significant correlation was recorded between log
   plasma FGF-23 and CIMT (r=0,497, P=0.0001). In multiple regression
   analysis, a high log FGF-23 concentration was a significant independent
   risk factor of an increased CIMT. Further studies are needed to clarify
   whether an increased plasma FGF-23 level is a marker or a potential
   mechanism for atherosclerosis in patients with end-stage renal disease.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Both cardiovascular calcification and atherosclerosis are

   (CAC), atherosclerotic plaques (AP) in the carotid artery and common
   carotid artery intima media thickness (CCA-IMT) in postmenopausal
   chronic haemodialysis (HD) women.
   Material and methods: CCA-IMT and presence and thickness of AP were
   measured with high-resolution ultrasound and CAC with multidetector
   computed tomography in a cross-sectional study of 22 postmenopausal HD
   women without any history of major cardiovascular complications. Serum
   mineral parameters, lipids, estradiol, progesterone and testosterone

   Results: The CAC was detected in 72\% of examined women. Mean CAC score
   in HD women was 770 +/- 1065 Agatston units. Mean thickness of CCA-IMT
   was 0.94 +/- 0.23 mm. The women who did not develop vascular
   calcification had lower CCA-IMT. In women without CAC the serum level of
   estradiol was significantly lower than in those with detectable CAC
   (28.2 +/- 8.2 vs 61.5 +/- 18.4 pg/mL). There was a tendency for higher
   serum estradiol in HD women with atherosclerotic lesions in the common

   adults. Serum phosphorus and other CV risk factor variables were
   measured in 856 white and 354 black subjects without known CV disease or
   renal disease. Carotid intima media thickness (IMT) was measured by
   B-mode ultrasonography. Significant race and gender differences were
   noted for serum phosphorus (blacks > whites) and carotid IMT (black
   women > white women; men > women). In bivariate analyses, serum
   phosphorus was correlated with carotid IMT (p < 0.001), and smokers
   showed higher phosphorus levels than nonsmokers (p = 0.008). In
   multivariate regression analyses, carotid IMT was significantly
   associated with serum phosphorus (regression coefficient beta = 0.028, p
   < 0.001) and smoking (beta = 0.032, p < 0.001), adjusting for other CV

   significant interaction effect of cigarette smoking and serum phosphorus
   on carotid IMT was noted, with a greater increasing trend of carotid IMT
   with phosphorus in smokers than in nonsmokers (p = 0.019 for

Abstract = {{Background: Ambigous results exist on fetuin-A as marker for vascular
   disease in type 2 diabetes. This study aims to define the role of
   fetuin-A as marker for micro-and macrovascular disease in a high risk
   population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and early diabetic
   nephropathy.
   Methods: Fetuin-A serum levels were assessed by ELISA in a
   cross-sectional setting in 153 patients with type 2 diabetes.
   Associations of fetuin-A with metabolic, inflammatory and vascular
   markers were studied. Atherosclerotic burden was assessed by
   ankle-brachial-index (ABI) as well as detection of common carotid artery
   intima-media thickness (IMT).
   Results: Levels of fetuin-A were lower in male than in female patients
   (0.49 +/- 0.15 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.20 g/L, p = 0.02). In addition, there was
   an inverse correlation with age (r = -0.20, P = 0.01). Bivariate
   correlations adjusted for age and gender revealed no significant
   correlations with metabolic parameters, except for a weak inverse
   correlation with serum adiponectin (r = -0.19, p = 0.02). Regarding
   parameters of micro-and macrovascular disease, fetuin-A was
   significantly associated with ABI (r = 0.18, p = 0.04), while there was
   no association with IMT (r = -0.07, p = n.s). Patients with an ABI < 0.9
   had lower fetuin A levels than patients with an ABI 0.9-1.3 or > 1.3
   (0.43 +/- 0.10 vs. 0.52 +/- 0.17 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.18 g/L p = 0.05).
   Neither GFR nor albuminuria were associated with fetuin-A serum levels.
   Patients with prevalent neuropathy did not have altered fetuin-A levels
   compared to diabetic controls. In step-wise logistic regression analysis
   including age, gender, HbA1c, total cholesterol, glomerular filtration
   rate and fetuin-A, only total cholesterol (beta = 0.01, p = 0.02) and
   fetuin-A (beta = -5.99, p = 0.03) proved to be independent predictors of
   an ABI < 0.9.
   Conclusions: The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that
   lower fetuin-A levels are associated with macrovascular late
   complications in high-risk type 2 diabetes patients while there are no
   associations of fetuin-A with metabolic status or microvascular
   complications.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Alkaline phosphatase is typically considered as an innocent
   bystander, but emerging data suggest that alkaline phosphatase might
   play a pathogenic role in vascular calcification and thus contribute to
   increased mortality in hemodialysis patients. Study design: Longitudinal
   analyses of the existing HEMO Study database. Setting and participants:
   1,827 HEMO Study participants. Predictor: Serum alkaline phosphatase
   level. Outcome and measurements: All-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
   Results: Based on the median serum alkaline phosphatase of 97 IU/l,
   participants were divided into low (< 97 IU/l) and high (>= 97 IU/l)
   serum alkaline phosphatase groups. The lower serum alkaline phosphatase
   group was associated with older age, male gender, non-black race and
   shorter dialysis years as well as higher serum calcium, higher serum
   calcium-phosphorus product and lower parathyroid hormone levels. Mean
   serum liver enzyme values were in the normal range in both groups, but
   the high alkaline phosphatase group had slightly higher values. In a
   multivariate time-dependent Cox model using baseline and follow-up
   values of serum alkaline phosphatase levels, adjusted for demographics,
   HEMO Study groups, comorbidity, bone metabolism parameters and liver
   enzymes, each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly
   associated with increased hazard of all-cause (hazard ratio 1.44, 95\%
   CI 1.30 - 1.59) and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.35, 95\% CI
   1.16 - 1.57). Limitations: Nonstandardized measurements of alkaline
   phosphatase. Conclusions: Serum alkaline phosphatase is associated with
   increased mortality in hemodialysis patients, independent of bone
   metabolism parameters and liver enzymes. Alkaline phosphatase might be a

Abstract = {{Background. Decreased coronary flow reserve (CFR) is a marker of
   endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery calcification and inflammation,
   well-known cardiovascular risk factors in haemodialysis (HD) patients.
   In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation of coronary
   artery calcification scores (CACS) with CFR in HD patients.
   Methods. Sixty-four end-stage renal failure patients were enrolled in
   this study (38 males, 26 females). Thirty-nine healthy subjects (22
   males, 17 females) were included in the control group. Biochemical
   parameters and acute-phase inflammation marker {[}high-sensitivity
   C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] of patients were recorded before dialysis.
   The CACS were measured by electron beam computerized tomography method.
   CFR recordings were performed by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography.
   The relationship between CACS and CFR was evaluated.
   Results. The mean CACS was 281 +/- 589 and 29 patients had CACS < 10.
   Patients with CACS > 10 had significantly lower CFR values compared to
   patients with CACS < 10 (1.56 +/- 0.38 vs 1.84 +/- 0.53, P = 0.024).
   However, there was no difference in hs-CRP values between the groups.
   CFR was negatively correlated with CACS (r = -0.276, P = 0.030). In
   multiple stepwise regression analysis, CACS was found to be an
   independent variable for predicting CFR (P = 0.048). During a follow-up
   of 18 months, 10 patients had experience of cardiovascular events.
   Patients with CACS > 10 had significantly higher event rate {[}34.5\%
   (10/29) vs 0\% (0/24)] compared to those with CACS < 10 (P = 0.001).
   Patients who developed cardiovascular events had significantly higher
   mean CACS and lower CFR values than the remaining group (P = 0.019 and P
   = 0.039). All of four patients who died during follow-up were in the CFR
   < 2 and CACS > 10 groups.
   Conclusions. CACS was associated with CFR in HD patients. However, we
   did not find any association of inflammation with CACS and CFR. This
   association between CFR and CACS might indicate two different
   (anatomical and functional) aspects of the common pathophysiology of the
   arterial system in HD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher
   mortality risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney
   disease. Though common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric
   diabetics, there are no studies on the prognostic significance of
   coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 diabetic
   nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric
   diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular
   filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73m(2) and a median urine
   protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification,
   measured by electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86\% of
   the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, male
   gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between
   eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy
   vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A
   graded relationship between the severity of calcification and all-cause
   mortality was consistently demonstrated on both univariate and
   multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of calcification
   score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the
   severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic
   kidney disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality.

   history of coronary artery calcification in early chronic kidney disease

Abstract = {{Aims: Vascular calcification and atherosclerosis frequently develop in
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although several reports have
   investigated both carotid artery calcification (CAAC) and carotid
   atherosclerosis in ESRD patients, the relationship between the two
   vascular conditions has remained unclear. The aim of this study was to
   assess the prevalence of CAAC and carotid artery plaque (CAP) in
   patients with ESRD and to investigate potential factors contributing to
   the development of CAAC and CAP. Material and method: This
   cross-sectional study assessed CAAC and CAP using multi-detector
   computed tomography and high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography,
   respectively, in 135 patients with ESRD at the start of hemodialysis.
   The prevalence of CAAC and CAP was examined. The risk factors associated
   with CAAC and CAP were also evaluated using a logistic regression model.
   Results: CAAC and CAP were found in 71\% and 65\%, of the patients,
   respectively. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and gender
   showed that CAAC was significantly associated with age, hypertension,
   dyslipidemia, serum albumin, calcium-phosphorus product, proteinuria and
   CAP. In contrast, in the same analysis, CAP was significantly correlated
   with age, male gender, diabetes, intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria
   and CAAC. In the multivariate analysis, CAAC was independently
   associated with age, hypertension, and calcium-phosphorus product. Male
   gender was identified as an independent determinant for CAP.
   Furthermore, CAP remained as an independent risk factor of CAAC(odds
   ratio (OR): 13.89; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 4.08-47.29), and CAAC
   also showed a high OR for having CAP(OR: 11.74; 95\% CI: 4.12 - 33.51).
   Conclusion: Both CAAC and CAP were associated with traditional and/or
   non-traditional risk factors. The risk factors of CAAC were different
   from those of CAP. CAAC or CAP was identified to be an independent risk
   factor for each other with a high OR, thus suggesting a strong
   relationship between carotid calcification and atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Objective We examined the value of renal resistive index (RRI) for
   prevalence of cardiovascular target organ damage in therapy-resistant
   hypertension in comparison to low-grade albuminuria.
   Methods Eighty-four patients with therapy-resistant hypertension (age
   59.7 +/- 8.1 years) were screened for cardiovascular target organ damage
   with coronary computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI), Doppler sonography for the assessment of carotid intima media
   thickness and, RRI, pulse wave velocity and for low-grade albuminuria of
   at least 10 mg/day in men and 15 mg/day in women, respectively.
   Results In patients with RRI greater than 0.7 pulse wave velocity (11.6
   +/- 3.7 vs. 9.8 +/- 2.2 m/s; P=0.02) intima media thickness (0.85 +/-
   0.09 vs. 0.76 +/- 0.1 mm; P=0.007) and Agatston score of coronary
   calcification (640 +/- 915 vs. 129 +/- 256; P=0.05) were increased,
   whereas left ventricular mass (127 +/- 24.5 vs. 125 +/- 15.0 g; P=0.70)
   was similar between the two groups. When patients were categorized
   according to low-grade albuminuria left ventricular mass was
   significantly higher in those with low-grade albuminuria (123 +/- 25.8

   Conclusion In patients with therapy-resistant hypertension RRI reflects
   functional and structural vascular parameters, whereas low-grade
   albuminuria is related to cardiac structural changes. Thus, measurement

Abstract = {{Background. Vascular calcifications (VCs) represent an important
   complication in dialysis patients. It is still a subject of debate
   whether VCs are associated with low or high intact parathormone (iPTH),
   or if it is not any relation. The purpose of this study was to assess
   the predictive value of iPTH and other mineral markers for VCs
   development.
   Methods. The study evaluated peripheral VCs in haemodialysis (HD) and
   peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients using radiographies. We counted a
   semiquantitative score ranging from 0 to 8. Each category was divided
   into two groups according to VCs score. We assessed the relationship
   between the VCs score and mineral markers.
   Results. A VC score=2 was positively associated with male gender, serum
   Ca, P, CaxP, ALP and iPTH levels in HD patients. There was no
   correlation with age, HD vintage, received treatment. In PD patients,
   did CaxP have a higher significance with VC score>/2; were iPTH, CaxP
   and P of higher significance for a score=5.
   Conclusions. Hyperparathyroidism can be considered a predictor for VCs
   development in dialysis patients. Other risk factors are increased serum
   Ca, P, CaxP and ALP levels. In PD patients, high iPTH could predict VCs
   only for severe calcifications, but the CaxP could even predict for less
   extended VCs.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is increasingly appreciated as an
   important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
   AIMS: To assess (1) the evolution of coronary calcification and (2) the
   relationship of the progression of coronary calcification with risk
   factors and adverse cardiovascular events.
   METHODS: We performed repeated 16 row multidetector computed tomography
   (CT) with an interval of 1 year on 33 patients on chronic hemodialysis.
   RESULTS: Progression of coronary artery calcification was found in 70\%
   of patients with a mean significant difference of calcium score.
   Patients older than 65 years demonstrated a higher progression of
   coronary calcification and patients who received non-calcium phosphate
   binder treatments demonstrated less progression. During the year, 6
   adverse cardiovascular events occurred. A total of 22\% of patients with
   progression of coronary calcification had a cardiovascular event
   (p=.003). Factors associated with adverse cardiovascular events included
   diabetes, male gender, history of cerebrovascular and coronary disease,
   secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, and calcification of
   circumflex and right coronary arteries.
   CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery calcification progression is common,
   represents a risk factor to adverse cardiovascular events, and is
   associated with modifiable risk factors in chronic hemodialysis.
   Multidetector CT seems to be an effective and readily applicable method
   to assess and quantify the progression of coronary artery calcification.}},

   was to evaluate the relationship between 25 hydroxyvitamin D serum
   level, cardiovascular risk factors and previous established
   cardiovascular disease in a group of patients with advanced chronic
   kidney disease. Material and methods: We performed a cross-sectional
   observational study in a cohort of 171 stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney
   disease out patients seen in our predialysis clinic, mean age 64.16 +/-
   13 years, 59.6\% were men, 64.3\% had diabetes, 47.3\% had obesity,
   46.8\% had previous cardiovascular disease. 25 hydroxyvitamin D and 1-25
   dihydroxyvitamin D were measured, we also determine other routine
   biochemical parameters. All subjects underwent an echocardiogram and 24
   hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was also performed. Results:
   Mean 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels were 22.1 +/- 13 ng/ml, only 18.7\% of
   the patients had adecuate levels, levels were insufficient in 58.5\% of
   the patients and deficient in 22.8\% of them. Low 25 hydroxyvitamin D
   levels were significatively related with age, diabetes, female gender,
   obesity, MDRD glomerular filtration rate and previous cardiovascular
   disease. Pulse pressure was the Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring
   parameter that was better correlated with 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels. We
   could not find any association between vitamin D levels and other bone
   and mineral metabolism parameters. No relationship was seen between low
   vitamin D levels and left ventricular hypertrophy. On multivariate
   analysis lower levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D were independently
   associated with female gender, previous cardiovascular disease,
   MDRD4-GFR and higher pulse pressure. Conclusions: Our study confirm a
   high prevalence of 25 hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in
   advanced chronic kidney disease patiens, this was associated with the
   presence of cardiovascular risk markers and previous established
   cardiovascular disease. However we could not see any relationship with
   left ventricular hypertrophy which is an known predictor of future

Abstract = {{Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes are the prominent risk factors
   of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9
   regulate vascular structure by degrading elastic fibre and inhibit
   angiogenesis by generating angiostatin. We hypothesized that MMP-2 and
   -9 were up-regulated in the arterial vasculature from CKD patients with
   diabetes, compared with those without diabetes.
   During living donor transplantation procedures, arteries from donors (n
   = 8) and recipients (non-diabetic, n = 8; diabetic, n = 8; matched in
   age, gender, and dialysis treatments) were harvested. Diabetic arteries
   had increased MMP-2 and -9 activities by 42 and 116\% compared with
   non-diabetic ones. Diabetic arteries were the stiffest, and the
   stiffness measurement was highly correlated with the summation of MMP-2
   + MMP-9 activities (r = 0.738, P = 0.0002). Pulse wave velocity
   measurements correlated with MMP activity (r = 0.683, P = 0.005).
   Elastic fibre degradation and calcification were worst in diabetic
   vessels. The phosphate level, which was 25\% higher in diabetic
   patients, correlated with MMP activity (r = 0.513, P = 0.04) and in
   vitro stiffness (r = 0.545, P = 0.03), respectively. Angiostatin
   expression was doubled, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor was
   50\% reduced in diabetic compared with non-diabetic vessels.
   Microvascular density in diabetic vessels was 48\% of that in
   non-diabetic ones, and it was strongly associated with MMP activity (r =
   -0.792, P < 0.0001) and vasorelaxation (r = 0.685, P = 0.0009).
   Using a matched case-control design, we report up-regulation of MMP-2
   and -9 in diabetic CKD arteries and correlate those with stiffening,
   impaired angiogenesis, and endothelial dysfunction. These findings may
   help to explain the high susceptibility of CVD in diabetic and
   non-diabetic CKD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Serum fetuin-A has been shown to be a strong risk marker for
   myocardial infarction/stroke in the general population, and has been
   associated with vascular calcifications in patients with chronic kidney
   disease. Although these issues are worthy of being addressed in children
   and adolescents as well, adequate age- and gender-related reference
   values are missing.
   Method: Within a healthy paediatric population (n = 246), fetuin-A serum
   concentrations were determined (ELISA kit; Epitope Diagnostics, San
   Diego, CA, USA) essentially as described by the manufacturer. At the
   same time, serum protein and serum albumin were measured with
   established procedures (Beckman Coulter Inc., Krefeld, Germany).
   Subjects were stratified according to age (<1 yr {[}n = 25], >= 1 and <6
   yr {[}n = 65], >= 6 and <12 yr {[}n = 66], >= 12 yr and <16 {[}n = 45]
   and >= 16 yr {[}n = 45]), and both genders were equally distributed
   within each age cohort.
   Results: Within each age cohort, fetuin-A serum concentrations were
   normally distributed, independent of age and gender and the respective
   reference range (mean +/- 1.96 SD) is 0.22-0.70 g/L (0.46 +/- 0.24 g/L).
   Conclusion: Fetuin-A serum concentrations are independent of age and
   gender in a healthy paediatric population and are well comparable with
   those determined in adults with the same assay.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the incidence and progression of coronary artery
   calcification in people with early chronic kidney disease. We used a
   cohort of 562 adult patients with chronic kidney disease who had an
   estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2), in a
   community-based study of people without clinical cardiovascular disease,
   the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The majority had stage 3
   disease. Coronary artery calcification was measured at baseline and
   again approximately 1.6 or 3.2 years later. The prevalence of coronary
   artery calcification at baseline was 66\%, and its adjusted prevalence
   was 24\% lower in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. The
   incidence of coronary artery calcification was 6.1\% per year in women
   and 14.8\% in men. Coronary artery calcification progressed in
   approximately 17\% of subjects per year across all subgroups, and
   diabetes was associated with a 65\% greater adjusted risk of
   progression. Male gender and diabetes were the only factors associated
   with adjusted coronary artery calcification incidence and progression,
   respectively. Our study shows that coronary artery calcification is
   common in people with stage 3 disease, progresses rapidly, and may
   contribute to cardiovascular risk. Kidney International (2009) 76,

Abstract = {{Background. Expression of bone proteins resulting from
   transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblasts
   suggests that vascular calcifications are a bioactive process.
   Osteoprotegerin (OPG) could play a key role in bone-vascular
   calcification imbalance and could be a marker of vascular calcification
   extent and progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
   relationships between vascular risk biomarkers (including classic risk
   factors and OPG) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) extent in
   chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and to establish within the
   markers the appropriate cut-off value to predict CAC.
   Methods. A total of 133 non-dialyzed CKD patients at various stages of
   kidney disease {[}75 males/58 females, median age: 69.9 (27.4-94.6)]
   were enrolled, excluding extrarenal replacement therapy patients. All
   underwent chest multi-detector computed tomography for CAC scoring.
   Blood samples were collected for measurement of vascular risk markers
   (kidney disease, inflammation, nutrition, calcium phosphate and OPG). A
   potential relationship between CAC and these biological markers was
   investigated, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was
   designed thereafter to identify a cut-off value of involved markers that
   best predicted the presence of CAC.
   Results. After adjustment for age, diabetes, smoking and gender, among
   biological markers, only low-estimated glomerular filtration rate using
   Modification of Diet in Renal Disease {[}OR = 3.63 (1.10-12.02)], high
   FEPO4 {[}OR = 3.99 (1.17-13.6)] and high OPG levels {[}OR = 8.54
   (2.14-34.11)] were associated with the presence of CAC. A protective
   effect of 1.25(OH)(2) vitamin D {[}OR = 0.20 (0.05-0.79)] and LDL
   cholesterol {[}OR = 0.27 (0.08-0.94)] on CAC was also observed. ROC
   curve analysis showed that the OPG best cut-off value predicting CAC was
   757.7 pg/mL.
   Conclusion. These results suggest that a CAC increase is strongly
   associated with a plasma OPG increase in CKD patients. The values of OPG
   >757.7 pg/mL allow us to predict the presence of CAC in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with end-stage renal disease have a very high prevalance and
   extent of arterial calcification. A number of studies suggest that
   similar pathophysiologic mechanisms are responsible for development and
   progression of calcification of atherosclerotic plaque and bone
   formation. Fetuin-A is a potent calcification inhibitor and is expressed
   in bone, with not-yet well-defined functions. The aim of this study was
   to investigate the relation between bone mineral densitometry
   parameters, coronary artery calcification, and serum fetuin-A levels. In
   a cross-sectional design, we included 72 maintenance hemodialysis (HD)
   patients and 30 age- and gender- matched healthy controls. Serum
   fetuin-A levels were studied both in maintenance HD patients and healthy
   controls. Maintenance HD patients had radius, hip, and lumbar spine bone
   mineral density (BMD) assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and
   coronary artery calcification score (CACS) measured by electron-beam
   computed tomography. The associations between site-specific BMD
   parameters, CACS, and serum fetuin-A levels were studied in maintenance
   HD patients. CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in coronary arteries were
   significantly higher in patients with a T-score below -2.5 than above in
   the proximal region of the radius, neck and trochanter of the femur, and
   the lumbar spine. Mean serum fetuin-A concentration was 0.636 +/- 0.118
   g/L in maintenance HD patients and it was less than healthy controls
   (0.829 +/- 0.100 g/L, P < 0.0001). CACS, mass, and volume of plaques in
   coronary arteries correlated significantly with the serum fetuin-A
   levels. Moreover, significant positive correlations were shown between
   the serum fetuin-A levels, BMD values, and T-scores of proximal radius,
   neck, and trochanter of the femur, but not with the lumbar spine. The
   present study demonstrates an association between serum fetuin-A levels,
   coronary artery calcification, and bone mineral densities-except for the
   lumbar spine, in maintenance HD patients. However, the results should be
   interpreted with caution because of the cross-sectional design of the
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Mineral metabolism abnormalities and
   inflammation are concerns in chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   Interrelationships among these parameters have not been analyzed.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements: The study included 133
   patients with CKD not on dialysis and not receiving calcium (Ca)
   supplements, phosphate binders, or vitamin D. Estimated GFR (eGFR) was
   34.1 +/- 6.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2); 107 participants had stage 3 CKD, and 26
   had stage 4.
   Results Patients were classified by tertiles of Ca, phosphorus (P), Ca-P
   product (Ca x P), and parathyroid hormone (PTH). After adjustment for
   age, gender, and eGFR, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6
   (IL-6) of the third tertile of P, Ca x P, and PTH were significantly
   higher than those of the first and second tertiles. Serum P and Ca x P
   directly correlated with CRP and IL-6, whereas HDL-cholesterol and eGFR
   inversely correlated with the levels of the inflammatory parameters.
   After partial correlation analysis, the previous associations between
   CRP and eGFR, and serum P, as well as the relationship between IL-6 and
   eGFR, and serum P, remained significant. Multiple regression analysis
   demonstrated that eGFR and serum P were independently associated with
   CRP and IL-6. Finally, logistic regression analysis using the
   presence/absence of an inflammatory state as the dependent variable
   showed that eGFR was a protective factor, whereas serum P was an
   independent risk factor for the presence of an inflammatory state.

Abstract = {{Background. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the
   chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. The mechanisms of vascular
   damage are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to
   prospectively investigate the importance of novel mediators of vascular
   damage, in conjunction with vascular calcification (VC), on survival.
   Methods. A total of 134 subjects {[}60 haemodialysis (HD), 28 peritoneal
   dialysis (PD) and 46 CKD stage 4] were studied. All survivors completed
   40 months of follow-up. VC was measured using multi-slice spiral CT of
   the superficial femoral artery. Circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG),
   Fetuin-A and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured
   in addition to standard clinical biochemical analysis.
   Results. After a 40-month follow-up, 31 patients had died (27 men and 4
   women). Of 31 subjects, 31 had evidence of significant VC. The majority
   of deaths were in the HD group (48\%), 36\% were PD subjects and 16\%
   were CKD subjects. The outcome of interest was survival at the end of
   follow-up. Multivariate logistical regression analysis revealed male
   gender {[}OR 8.06 (1.34-48.450) P = 0.02], OPG > 25 pmol/L {[}OR
   5.31(1.35-20.88) P = 0.02] and hypoalbuminaemia {[}OR 0.26 (0.12-0.56) P
   < 0.01], were associated with increased odds of death.
   Conclusion. We have previously reported that VC and low albumin predict
   death in CKD stages 4 and 5 over a 2-year follow-up period. These data
   show that OPG, independent of CRP, is also associated with a negative
   outcome. The mechanisms remain to be elucidated; however, it is likely
   that they are associated with vascular damage through mechanisms in
   addition to VC.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), aortic
   calcification is more frequent and severe and it is also predictive of
   adverse cardiovascular outcome. The aim of the present study was to
   characterize aortic calcification in renal compared with non-renal
   patients.
   Methods. Aortas of 31 patients with advanced CKD and of 31 age-and
   gender-matched controls were obtained at autopsy. Calcium and phosphorus
   content in the aorta was quantitated using x-ray analysis. The
   expression of calcification-promoting and calcification-inhibiting
   proteins was assessed using immunohistochemistry.
   Results. The calcium and phosphorus content of the aorta was higher in
   CKD patients than in controls. Even in non-calcified aortic specimens of
   CKD, staining for Msx-2, BMP-2, bone sialo-protein, TNF-alpha and
   nitrotyrosine was significantly more marked compared to controls. The
   same proteins were immunodetected in calcified aortic specimens of both
   CKD and controls. In contrast, staining for transglutaminase-2 and
   Fetuin A was significantly reduced in CKD. Higher expression of cbfa-1
   and Pit-1 was observed in all calcified aortas with no difference
   between CKD and controls. The expression of TNF-alpha, phospho-p38 and
   Msx-2 was correlated to the intensity of up-regulation of BMP-2 and
   osteoblastic transdifferentiation by VSMC even in non-calcified areas of
   the aortas of CKD.
   Conclusion. The expression of markers characteristic for calcification
   is not different in calcified aorta of CKD patients compared to
   controls, but in CKD patients, evidence of inflammation, transformation
   to an osteoblastic pheno-type and reduced expression of transglutaminase
   are also found even in non-calcified aorta.}},

   veins (under compression) and arteries, and the arterial peak systolic
   velocity (PSV) were measured. The presence of arterial calcifications
   was noted. The positions for possible native AVF construction
   (radiocephalic and brachiocephalic) were suggested and an AVF was
   constructed by a trained nephrologist. An adequate cephalic vein was

   +/- 0.5 mm (calcifications in 29\%). In 32\% of patients, one native AVF
   was possible, in 17\% two, in 23\% three and in 18\% four, while in 10\%
   no AVF was possible. In 84\% of patients an AVF was constructed, with no
   significant difference in non-diabetic vs. diabetic patients (88\% vs.
   80\%) or females vs. males (87\% vs. 83\%). Native AVF can be
   constructed in the majority of elderly patients, often in multiple

   standard HD thrice weekly.
   Results. ESRD was strongly associated with the combination of 2G/2G and
   6A/6A homozygosity: OR 2.57 (0.95-7.4), P = 0.037, but not with isolated
   2G/2G and 6A/6A homozygosity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.11, respectively).
   Isolated 2G/2G was associated with all-cause mortality risk
   independently from age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking,
   dyslipidaemia, C-reactive protein, albumin, dialysis vintage and history
   of cardio-vascular disease: HR 2.96 (1.29-6.80), P = 0.01. A trend for
   the association of mortality and isolated 6A/6A homozygosity was also
   observed: HR 3.01 (0.88-10.26), P = 0.078. Combination of 2G/2G and
   6A/6A homozygosity significantly increased the mortality risk in the
   same Cox regression model: HR 4.69 (1.72-12.81), P = 0.003.
   Conclusions. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that
   MMP-1 and MMP-3 gene polymorphisms are negative prognostic risk factors
   for all-cause mortality in HD patients, independently from traditional
   risk factors. These data may have important implications for better
   understanding the pathogenesis of the increased mortality in HD
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of
   mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vitamin D might have
   beneficial effects on vascular health. The aim of this study was to
   determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D
   {[}25D] <= 15 ng/ml) and insufficiency (25D levels between 16 and 30
   ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at different CKD stages and the
   relationships between vitamin D serum levels, vascular calcification and
   stiffness, and the mortality risk.
   Design, setting, participants \& measurements: One hundred forty CKD
   patients (85 men, mean age 67 +/- 12 yr, CKD stages 2 {[}8\%], 3
   {[}26\%], 4 {[}26\%], 5 {[}7\%], and 5D {[}(33\%]) were allocated for a
   prospective study. Serum levels of 25D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D,
   aortic calcification score, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were
   evaluated.
   Results: There was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42\%) and
   insufficiency (34\%). Patients with 25 <= 16.7 ng/ml (median) had a
   significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D > 16.7 ng/ml
   (mean follow-up, 605 +/- 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05).
   Multivariate adjustments (included age, gender, diabetes, arterial
   pressure, CKD stage, phosphate, albumin, hemoglobin, aortic
   calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as an independent
   predictor of all-cause mortality.
   Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were highly
   prevalent in this CKD cohort. Low 25D levels affected mortality
   independently of vascular calcification and stiffness, suggesting that
   25D may influence survival in CKD patients via additional pathways that
   need to be further explored. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 4: 1128-1135, 2009.

Abstract = {{Objective: Both chronic inflammation and dysregulation of bone and
   mineral metabolism are closely related with long-term outcomes of
   dialysis patients. Our objective was to investigate the relationship
   between these two abnormalities.
   Design: This was a cross-sectional study.
   Setting: This study was performed at a hospital-based hemodialysis
   center.
   Patients: We enrolled 448 (male, 198; female, 250) clinically stable
   hemodialysis patients. Patients with chronic inflammatory disease,
   malignancy, or viral hepatitis were excluded. Their age (mean +/- SD)
   was 57.4 +/- 12.5 years.
   Main Outcome Measures: Biomarkers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive
   protein (hsCRP), total calcium, phosphate, and intact parathyroid
   hormone levels, were measured and compared with the recommended range in
   the K/DOQI guidelines. Correlations between these parameters were
   analyzed, and factors independently associated with hsCRP and the
   calcium phosphate product (Ca x P) were identified by regression
   analysis.
   Results: Most patients did not achieve the K/DOQI recommended
   therapeutic range in the four parameters, and only 50 patients (11\%)
   met their treatment goals. The hsCRP level was directly related to
   calcium, phosphate, and Ca 3 P. Patients who achieved the guidelines'
   range had lower hsCRP levels (1.97 mg/L vs. 2.71 mg/L, P < .05). A high
   hsCRP level (S 10 mg/L) was associated with higher calcium, phosphate,
   and Ca 3 P levels, and lower albumin levels. Serum albumin, Ca 3 P,
   alkaline phosphatase, and diabetes independently predicted hsCRP levels.
   Conclusion: There is a strong association between chronic inflammation
   and the disturbance of bone mineral metabolism in chronic hemodialysis

Abstract = {{Background. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among
   renal transplant recipients. Aortic calcification is associated with
   increased mortality in dialysis subjects. The significance of aortic
   calcification among renal transplant recipients is unknown. Our
   objective was to prospectively examine the association of aortic
   calcification with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality among
   asymptomatic incident renal transplant recipients.
   Methods. One hundred and twelve renal transplant recipients underwent
   electron beam computed tomography. Aortic calcification was scored by
   the Agatston method. The mean follow-up time was 5.1 years.
   Cardiovascular events (heart failure, coronary artery disease,
   peripheral arterial disease and stroke) and all-cause mortality were
   recorded.
   Results. The cohort consisted of 62\% Caucasians, 38\% African Americans
   and 62\% male gender. The mean age was 49.0 +/- 12.5 years. Thirty-four
   percent had aortic calcification. During follow-up, 12 cardiovascular
   events and 10 deaths were recorded. Subjects with aortic calcification
   had more cardiovascular events compared to those without aortic
   calcification (23.7 versus 4.1\%, P = 0.001). Recipients with aortic
   calcification had higher mortality compared to those without aortic
   calcification but it did not reach statistical significance (15.8 versus
   5.4\%, P = 0.07). The univariate hazard ratio of aortic calcification
   score in a proportional hazard Cox model to assess event-free survival
   was 1.15 (1.04-1.27, P = 0.01). Diabetes and aortic calcification score
   were independently associated with survival. In addition to the
   predictors above, dialysis vintage was an independent predictor for
   combined future cardiovascular event and mortality.
   Conclusions. In conclusion, aortic calcification is prevalent among
   renal transplant recipients and is predictive of future cardiovascular
   events. Aortic calcification is easily identified by non-invasive
   testing, and should be considered when assessing cardiovascular risk in
   asymptomatic renal transplant recipients.}},

Abstract = {{Background Central venous thrombosis is a serious and life-threatening
   complication in hemodialysis (HD) patients with an indwelling catheter.
   The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and
   characteristics of thrombosis of the superior vena cava and auxiliary
   branches in Chinese HD patients with an indwelling internal jugular
   venous catheter and to explore its risk factors.
   Fifty-four patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) with an indwelling
   catheter were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The thrombosis of
   the internal jugular vein, subclavical vein, brachiocephalic vein and
   superior vena cava was assessed by vascular ultrasound. Collected were
   data on age, gender, ultrafiltration volume, Kt/V, blood pressure,
   levels of hemoglobin, serum albumin, lipid, calcium, and phosphorus, and
   parathyroid hormone.
   Results The patients were given short- or long-term double lumen central
   venous catheters. Among them, 42 patients had the catheter placed into
   the right internal jugular vein, and 12 patients into the left internal
   jugular vein. Different degrees of central venous thrombosis were found
   in 33 patients (61.1\%). The prevalence of thrombosis in the jugular
   vein, brachiocephalic vein, subclavical vein and superior vena cava was
   61.1\% (33/54), 44.4\% (24/54), 16.7\% (9/54) and 5.6\% (3/54),
   respectively. Among the 33 HD patients with central venous thrombosis,
   the percentages for one, two, three and four affected veins were 27.3\%
   (9/33), 45.4\% (15/33), 18.2\% (6/33) and 9.1\% (3/33), respectively.
   Twelve (12/33, 36.4\%) of the 33 HD patients with central venous
   thrombosis had clinical symptoms. Nine patients (27.3\%) had edema of
   the upper extremity and 3 (9.1 \%) had new-onset symptoms of pulmonary
   embolism such as cough, chest distress and short breath. The incidences
   of diabetes mellitus and malignant tumor and levels of lipoprotein a and
   homocysteic acid were significantly higher in the HD patients with
   central venous thrombosis than in those without central venous
   thrombosis. Logistic regressive analysis revealed that high level of
   homocysteic acid was the important risk factor for central venous
   thrombosis in HD patients with indwelling catheterization of the
   internal jugular vein.
   Conclusions The prevalence of central venous thrombosis in Chinese HD
   patients with indwelling catheterization of the internal jugular vein is
   quite high, especially in those patients with diabetes mellitus,
   malignant tumor, high levels of serum lipoprotein and homocysteic acid.
   Its clinical symptoms are insidious but dangerous. High level of
   homocysteic acid may be the important risk factor for central venous
   thrombosis in Chinese HD patients with indwelling catheterization of the
   internal jugular vein.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Vascular calcifications (VCs) are frequently observed in
   chronic kidney disease (CKD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients. They have
   been associated with numerous factors, particularly hyperphosphataemia,
   excess calcium load, hypertension and increased mortality rate. The
   purpose of this study is to measure VCs in long-HD patients with good
   blood pressure and phosphate control, with the occasional use of
   sevelamer, using a plain radiological score to identify the associated
   factors and effects on the 1-year survival rate.
   Methods. We studied HD patients from one centre using a
   semi-quantitative score ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity
   and extent of VCs. The following patients' characteristics were compared
   according to their VC scores: medical history, treatments, blood
   pressure, standard biological data, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23,
   osteoprotegerin (OPG), whole PTH, beta-crosslaps, bone alkaline
   phosphatases and bone mineral density scores. One-year survival analyses
   were also performed.
   Results. Among the 250 HD patients of the centre, 161 were studied; the
   mean age was 67.2 +/- 13 years, 45\% of the subjects were females, 35\%
   were diabetics, and they had been on dialysis for between 1-486 months
   (median: 45 months) with a 3 x 5-3 x 8 h dialysis schedule using 1.5
   mmol/l dialysate calcium and providing a mean 2.25 +/- 0.5 Kt/V. Only
   17\% of the patients were free from VCs and 11\% had severe VCs. The
   factors associated with VCs were classified into `classic' (age,
   diabetes, male gender, tobacco use, inflammation, more frequent warfarin
   treatment and peripheral vascular and cardiac diseases) and
   `non-traditional' (higher FGF-23 and OPG serum levels, low albumin serum
   levels and low alfacalcidol and CaCO(3) use). In logistic regression,
   only age, diabetes and FGF-23 serum levels were associated with VC
   scores of 2 and 3. The patients with a score of 3 had a higher 1-year
   mortality rate (RR 2.1; P = 0.01) as compared to patients with a 0
   score.
   Conclusion. A plain radiological score showed the high prevalence (83\%)
   of VCs in HD patients in spite of a long and intensive dialysis strategy
   and adherence to guidelines. The main associated factors were classic
   factors such as ageing and diabetes. No relationship was found with
   blood pressure and phosphataemia that remained well controlled in long
   dialysis; the association with FGF-23 serum levels may aggregate some
   non-traditional risk factors. The harmful effects of VCs on survival
   require their systematic assessment and optimization of the potentially
   modifiable associated factors in CKD and HD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a wide range of severe
   metabolic and nutritional disturbances that directly or indirectly
   contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy, ischemic heart disease,
   vascular calcification, heart failure and other manifestations of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD). The CVD mortality rate in CKD patients. is
   far higher than in the general population, and CKD is today recognized
   as one of the most important risk factors for CVD. In this review, we
   discuss the links between metabolic abnormalities and CVD in CKD
   patients and nutritional initiatives that may reduce this risk.
   Recent findings
   Certain nontraditional risk factors, such as protein-energy wasting,
   inflammation, and biomarkers reflecting bone and mineral disorders, are
   strong predictors of CVD mortality in CKD patients. Although several
   small nutritional intervention studies have been performed and
   nutritional guidelines have been introduced in order to minimize
   metabolic disorders and improve nutritional status, they have so far not
   been proven to reduce morbidity nor mortality.
   Summary
   Although the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the markedly
   increased CVD risk of CKD patients are becoming more evident, still few
   nutritional randomized controlled studies have been conducted in this
   high-risk patient group.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients on hemodialysis (HD) frequently experience
   cardiovascular events associated with vascular calcification. We
   investigated the involvement of osteoprotegerin (OPG), an inhibitor of
   vascular calcification, in the incidence of cardiovascular events and
   mortality among new HD patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective
   cohort study of the association of serum OPG levels with morbidity and
   mortality in subjects who became new HD patients between June 2000 and
   May 2006. Results: A total of 99 patients (age 58.9 +/- 14.6 years, 65
   male, 34 female) were prospectively followed up for 41.5 +/- 20.2
   months. During this period, 27 patients developed cardiovascular events
   and 12 died of causes related to cardiovascular disease. When divided
   into 2 groups according to OPG levels, the high OPG group showed a
   higher prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared
   with the low OPG group. Cox's proportional hazards analysis associated
   the new onset of cardiovascular events with the high OPG group (HR 2.88,
   95\% CI 1.09-7.62, p = 0.033). Furthermore, the high OPG group at the
   start of HD was significantly associated with older age, male gender and
   a high aortic calcification index. Conclusions: Elevated levels of serum
   OPG in new HD patients may predict subsequent cardiovascular events.

Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Dialysis patients display an increased mortality which
   is associated with cardiovascular calcifications. Diabetes mellitus and
   ethnicity are known factors that affect the extent of cardiovascular
   calcifications. However, most studies have investigated mixed cohorts
   with diabetics and/or mixed ethnicity. Methods: Cardiovascular
   calcifications were assessed in non-diabetic Caucasian haemodialysis
   patients by the semiquantitative Adragao calcification score (X-ray
   pelvis and hands) and a novel composite calcification score encompassing
   the Adragao score as well as calcifications detected by X-ray of the
   fistula arm, echocardiography of heart valves and carotid ultrasound.
   Results: Using multivariate analysis, age, male gender, dialysis
   vintage, lower Kt/V, calcium-phosphate product, smoking and
   high-sensitivity CRP were independent risk factors for cardiovascular
   calcifications as assessed by the Adragao or the composite score. Pulse
   wave velocity was independently related to both calcification scores.
   Body mass index, cholesterol, triglycerides, iPTH and serum levels of
   fetuin-A and uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein were not associated with
   cardiovascular calcifications. Conclusions: In our cohort of
   non-diabetic Caucasian haemodialysis patients, age, male gender,
   dialysis vintage, smoking, calcium-phosphate product, high-sensitivity
   CRP and lower Kt/V were independent risk factors for cardiovascular
   calcifications. Whether lowering the calcium-phosphate product and
   increasing dialysis efficiency can reduce cardiovascular calcifications
   in dialysis patients remains to be determined. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

Abstract = {{Introduction. Vascular calcification is a common finding in patients
   (pts) with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Objective. The aim of this
   cross-sectional study was to investigate the prevalence and functional
   effect of native arteriovenous fistula AVF (feeding artery and/or
   arterialized vein) calcifications evaluated by spiral computed
   tomography (CT) in ESRD pts undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD).
   Patients and method. Forty-five upper limb AVF (radial 44.4\% or
   brachial 55.6\%, mean duration 65.3 +/- 80.9 months) without evidence of
   significant stenosis were evaluated by CT in 45 ESRD pts (mean age 63.8
   +/- 13.1 yr, sex M: 71.1\%, F: 28.9\%; mean time on HD 53.1 +/- 51.9
   months, diabetic nephropathy 15.6\%). All AVF explorations were
   performed using the same multi-slice spiral CT scanner (HiSpeed Dual
   machine, GE Medical Systems). The severity of AVF calcifications was
   quantified by CT using the following criteria: grade I absence of
   calcifications, grade II isolated calcifications (< 10 groups of
   calcification), grade III moderate calcifications (10-20 groups of
   calcification) and grade IV diffuse calcifications (> 20 groups of
   calcification). Laboratory parameters analyzed: calcium, phosphorus,
   parathyroid hormone; calcium x phosphorus product was calculated. The
   same week of CT scanning, we evaluated AVF function measuring the blood
   flow rate (Q). We determined Q(A) (1559.3 +/- 980.6 ml/min) by the
   Delta-H method (ABF-mode, HemaMetrics, USA) using the CritLine III
   monitor (68.9\%) or by Doppler ultrasound (31.1\%) performed by the same
   radiologist using a 5-8 MHz linear transducer (Sequoia machine,
   Siemens-Acuson); mean arterial pressure MAP (94.7 +/- 16.3 mmHg) was
   recorded simultaneous with Q(A). Results. Most pts not showed AVF
   calcification by CT scan (grade 1: 27145, 60\%). Forty percent of pts
   (18145) demonstrated any degree of AVF calcification (grade II 13.3\%,
   grade III 8.9\%, grade IV 17.8\%). Pts with brachial AVF showed higher
   mean Q(A) compared to pts with radial AVF (1899.1 +/- 1131.8 versus
   1134.5 +/- 516.4 ml/min, p=0.005), but MAP (91.2 +/- 15.8 versus 99.0
   +/- 16.2 mmHg) and the prevalence of AVF calcification (32\% versus
   50\%) were not different between both groups (p=0.11 and p=0.24,
   respectively). Pts with evidence of any calcification on CT scanning
   (grade II, III or IV) had higher time on HD (84.6 +/- 63.1 versus 24.6
   +/- 20.0 months), higher AVF duration (97.7 +/- 89.3 versus 34.6 +/-
   61.2 months) and similar Q(A) (1488.3 +/- 678.9 versus 1606.6 +/- 1148.9
   ml/min) compared with pts without AVF calcification (p=0.014, p=0.001
   and p=0.69, respectively); no differences in MAP (95.4 +/- 13.8 versus
   94.2 +/- 17.9 mmHg), prevalence of brachial AVF (44\% versus 63\%) or
   mineral metabolism parameters were found when comparing both groups (for
   all comparisons, p=NS). The same results were obtained when comparing
   pts with a high (grade III-IV: 26.7\%) and a low (grade I-II: 73.3\%)
   AVF calcification score, or when comparing pts with diffuse (grade IV)
   and without (grade I) AVF calcification. Conclusions. 1) The prevalence
   of AVF calcification by CT scan was 40\%. 2) The AVF calcification was
   related with time on HD and AVF duration. 3) The function of fully
   developed AVF without stenosis and suitable for routine HD was not
   impaired by the presence of calcifications.}},

Abstract = {{Background Fetuin-A, a negative acute phase protein that inhibits
   vascular calcification, has a controversial association with mortality
   in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Chronic inflammation, which is
   common in CKD, may promote vascular calcification.
   Materials and methods We investigated the impact of inflammation on the
   relationship between serum fetuin-A and mortality (42 months) in 222
   prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients.
   Results Serum fetuin correlated negatively with comorbidity score
   (assessed by Davies score) and circulating inflammatory markers.
   Patients with low fetuin-A levels (< median) had higher mortality
   (Hazard ratio `HR' 2.2; CI 1.4-3.5, P < 0.001), but this association was
   lost after adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities score, dialysis
   vintage and inflammation (CRP > median). In inflamed patients with low
   fetuin a significantly independent association with mortality (HR 2.3;
   CI 1.2-4.5, P = 0.01) was observed compared to non-inflamed patients
   with high fetuin-A, after adjusting for the same variables. Non-inflamed
   patients with low fetuin-A and inflamed patients with high fetuin-A did
   not have increased mortality compared to non-inflamed patients with high
   fetuin-A.
   Conclusions The results show that low levels of serum fetuin-A are
   associated with increased mortality in HD patients only in the presence
   of inflammation. This suggests that coexistence of a low serum fetuin-A
   level and low-grade inflammation exerts an additive effect on the risk
   of death in HD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic kidney disease (CKD), and particularly kidney failure, is
   associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and approximately a 20-fold
   increased risk of cardiovascular death. The majority of these patients
   die from complications directly attributed to atherosclerosis and their
   life expectancy is decreased. Established risk factors are involved in
   the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. Age, gender, smoking, hypertension,
   dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus are among the established risk
   factors. Inflammation, qualitative lipid disorders (e. g. small dense
   low density lipoprotein), vascular calcification and oxidative stress
   represent emerging risk factors. The precise mechanism of
   atherosclerosis in patients with kidney failure is not yet known.
   CKD might represent a clinical model of atherogenesis. Thus, the
   evidence obtained from investigating ``renal{''} atherogenesis could be
   of interest in improving our understanding of this disease process in
   the non-renal population.
   We review the relationship between ``renal{''} and non-renal
   atherosclerosis focusing on pathogenesis, risk factors and clinical
   events and how they interact with treatment options. Overall, the

Abstract = {{Increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and
   augmentation index (Aix), and vascular calcification have been
   associated with an unfavourable cardiovascular outcome in hemodialysis
   patients. However, the majority of data have been published in white
   patients and epidemiological data are discordant on the fate of patients
   of different races. In this cross sectional study we measured PWV and
   Aix by applanation tonometry and coronary artery and thoracic aorta
   calcium score (CAC and AoC) by electron beam tomography (EBT) in 81
   Blacks and 61 Whites on maintenance hemodialysis. Vascular stiffness
   measurements and EBT scans were performed within a week of each other.
   There was no difference between races in age, systolic blood pressure or
   gender distribution. Blacks had a more frequent history of hypertension
   (100\% versus 89\%; P = 0.002), lower prevalence of dyslipidemia (30\%
   versus 66\%; P < 0.001), higher PTH levels (geometric mean 607 pg/ml
   versus 245 pg/ml; P = 0.039), received calcium based phosphate binders
   less frequently (37\% versus 60\%, P = 0.007) and calcium antagonists
   more frequently than Whites (54\% versus 28\%; P = 0.003). Nonetheless,
   the unadjusted and risk adjusted PWV and Aix, as well as CAC and AoC
   were not statistically different between races. In this dialysis cohort
   there was no difference in markers of vasculopathy between black and
   white patients despite differences in baseline clinical characteristics.
   Epidemiological data from the general population indicate that Blacks
   have lower calcium scores and stiffer vessels than Whites. Some studies
   in the renal populations suggest a better and others a similar survival
   of Blacks and Whites on hemodialysis. Our findings raise the important
   question of the prognostic significance of markers of vasculopathy in
   patients of different races and with different risk profiles. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{Calciphylaxis characterized by schemic skin ulceration due to
   subcutaneous small arterioles calcification, is a rare disease but
   usually fatal. Disorders of calcium metabolism and vascular
   calcifications are common in dialysis patients but calciphylaxis
   prevalence is low in patients with end stage renal disease. So we
   proposed other emergent factors implicated in calciphylaxis development.
   Methods: We studied retrospective 8 patients who developed calciphylaxis
   in our service from january 2001 to december 2006. Results: All patients
   were female with mean age at diagnosis 68.5+/-6.7 years. All patients
   were receiving hemodialysis therapy and 6 patients had been receiving
   hemodialysis less than four months. Six patients had diabetes mellitus
   type II and all patients were obese (BMI > 25 kg/m(2)). All patients had
   metabolic syndrome (APTIII) with bad control hypertension and 6 (75\%)
   were receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Patients didn't
   have severe alterations of calcium metabolism, all had product
   calcium-phosphorus < 55. All patients developed low blood pressure at
   the beginning of dialysis treatment (98.3+/-22.7160+/-18,29 mmHg). 7
   patients present proximal lesions in fatty regions like abdomen and
   thighs. Histopathologic examination reveals calcium deposits in
   arteriole-sized and small vessels with vascular thrombosis. Prognosis
   was poor seven patients died secondary to a sepsis originated in
   infected cutaneous ulcers. Conclusions: calciphylaxis is a disease with
   poor prognosis and high mortality without specific treatment actually.
   Female gender obesity associated with diabetes mellitus and
   cardiometabolic syndrome, anticoagulant therapy with warfarin and low
   blood pressure associated with hemodialysis therapy, are risk factors to
   develop calciphylaxis, in absence of severe disorders of calcium
   metabolism. In these patients is important to avoid hypotension episodes
   during dialysis, dialysis hypotension appears to be an important risk
   factor who promotes ischemia of subcutaneous adipose tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Vascular calcification is increasingly
   recognized as an important component of cardiovascular disease in
   chronic kidney disease. The objective of this study was to investigate
   prospectively the determinants, cardiovascular functional consequences,
   and survival associated with vascular calcification over 24 mo.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements: A total of 134 patients
   (60 on hemodialysis, 28 on peritoneal dialysis, and 46 with stage 4
   chronic kidney disease) were studied. Vascular calcification of the
   superficial femoral artery was assessed using multislice spiral computed
   tomography; pulse wave velocity; all medications and time-averaged
   biochemical parameters were recorded at baseline and 12 and 24 mo.
   Results: A total of 101 patients remained at 24 mo. Progressive
   calcification was seen in 58 of 101 patients. Most (31 of 46) patients
   with an initial calcification score of zero did not develop
   calcification. The hemodialysis group demonstrated a greater degree of
   progression than patients who were on peritoneal dialysis or had stage 4
   chronic kidney disease. Progressive calcification was associated with
   age, male gender, serum alkaline phosphatase, 13 blockers, and
   lipid-lowering agents. Increases in vascular calcification correlated
   with increased arterial stiffness. Vascular calcification was present in
   20 of 21 patients who died. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified
   change in calcification score, calcium intake from phosphate binders,
   and low albumin as risk factors for death.
   Conclusions: Patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease and
   preexisting vascular calcification exhibit significantly increased
   calcification over 24 mo. Rapid progression of calcification is
   associated with arterial stiffness and mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Background. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence and
   extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic
   kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 and 4 comparing those with and without
   diabetes. We also wished to determine if the presence of peripheral
   artery calcification (PAC) would assist in identifying patients positive
   for CAC.
   Methods. CAC was detected by multi-slice computed tomography and PAC was
   detected by plain foot radiography. Study population was 112 patients,
   54 with diabetes and 58 without, all asymptomatic for heart disease.
   Demographic and laboratory data were collected and analysed.
   Results. The prevalence of CAC in CKD patients was 76 and 46.5 with and
   without diabetes, respectively. Patients with diabetes had higher CAC
   scores with more vessels affected, and in the presence of diabetes men
   and women had the same risk for CAC. In patients with diabetes, age was
   the unique explanatory variable for detecting the presence of CAC, while
   age and smoking history predicted severity. In patients without
   diabetes, age, male gender, body mass index, estimated glomerular
   filtration rate and serum phosphate levels predicted the presence of
   CAC, while parathyroid hormone predicted severity. Prevalence of PAC was
   63 and 12 in subjects with and without diabetes. PAC detected by foot
   radiography was not an adequate alternative-screening marker for
   identifying patients with CAC.
   Conclusions. CAC is common in CKD stages 3 and 4 patients, especially in
   men and women with diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Vascular calcification, which significantly increases
   cardiovascular and other causes of mortality, is highly prevalent in
   hemodialysis patients. The aim of the present study was to examine the
   association between serum magnesium levels and vascular calcification in
   hemodialysis patients. Methods: 390 nondiabetic patients on maintenance
   hemodialysis (226 males and 164 females, 59 13 years) were examined.
   Hand roentgenography was performed in each patient, and visible vascular
   calcification of the hand arteries was evaluated. Blood was drawn to
   measure serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium and intact parathyroid
   hormone levels. Results: There were 52 patients (38 males and 14
   females) with vascular calcification, and 338 (188 males and 150
   females) without. Serum phosphate was significantly higher in the former
   compared with the latter group (p < 0.005); serum intact parathyroid
   hormone was significantly higher (p < 0.05), whereas serum calcium was
   not statistically different between the two groups. Serum magnesium was
   significantly lower in patients with vascular calcification than in
   those without (2.69 +/- 0.28 vs. 2.78 +/- 0.33 mg/dl, p < 0.05).
   Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that serum magnesium
   concentration was a significant independent factor associated with the
   presence of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients (odds ratio
   0.28, 95\% Cl 0.09 - 0.92/1 mg/dl increase in serum magnesium, p =
   0.036) after adjustment for age, gender, duration of hemodialysis,
   calcium, phosphate and intact parathyroid hormone concentrations.
   Conclusion: Hypomagnesemia is significantly associated with the presence
   of vascular calcification of the hand arteries, independent of serum
   calcium and phosphate levels. These results suggest that higher serum
   magnesium concentrations may play an important protective role in the
   development of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients, and that
   magnesium concentration of dialysis fluid may be reconsidered in view of
   preventing vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of
   both divalent ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to
   possible biochemical differences between dialysis (D) and
   transplantation (Tx), we examined the entity and severity of these
   biochemical modifications and of coronary artery calcium score
   separately in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard
   markers of inflammation, divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin,
   matrix Gla protein (MGP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients
   (age 45 +/- 12 years; 30 males, 21 females; previous D duration 4.8 +/-
   4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 +/- 5.5 years; Cr 1.8 +/- 0.6 mg/dl) and in 49 D
   patients (age 49 +/- 14 years; 30 males, 19 females; D duration 5.6 +/-
   4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium score (AS) was evaluated by
   cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx patients had better
   values of divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower prevalence
   (65 vs. 86\%; p < 0.02) and severity (AS = 570 +/- 1,637 vs. 1,311 +/-
   3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary calcification. In addition, a tendency
   toward normalization for all of the three calcification inhibitory
   proteins was evident. In both Tx and D, AS correlated with age and OPG
   (Tx: r(s) = 0.439, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: r(s) =
   0.471, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.403, p < 0.005, respectively); in D
   patients, a correlation was present also with D duration (r(s) = 0.435;
   p < 0.002), other markers of inflammation and, notably, fetuin (r(s) =
   -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression analysis selected previous time on D in
   Tx patients (r(m) = 0.400; p < 0.004), and C-reactive protein and OPG in
   D patients (r(m) = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most predictive parameters
   of AS. Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age and D
   duration in the appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct
   risk condition. At variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS.
   In conclusion, as compared to D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of
   calcification inhibition proteins and of divalent ions closer to normal.
   As this is associated with a lower prevalence and severity of AS, it is
   suggested that Tx antagonize the accelerating role of D in the
   progression of vascular calcification. Assessment of both coronary
   calcifications and serum levels of calcification inhibitory proteins may
   be of value to identify those subjects at higher risk of development and
   progression of vascular lesions, among whom males have the highest rate.

Abstract = {{Background: Coronary artery calcifications independently predict
   cardiovascular events (CVE) in the general population. We assessed the
   prevalence and determinants of coronary (CAC) and thoracic aorta (AoC)
   calcifications in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Methods:
   Consecutive RTR living in Belgium, with an isolated kidney graft
   functioning for more than 1 year, were asked to participate. They
   underwent a 16-slice spiral computerized tomography in order to measure
   calcium mass. Demographic, clinical, biochemical and urinary parameters
   were recorded. Results: We included 281 patients. CAC and AoC were
   detected in 81 and 85\%, with geometric means (SD) of 52.2 (4.9) and
   99.3 (8.2) mg, respectively. By multiple linear regression, independent
   predictors of both types of calcifications included older age, longer
   time on dialysis, a history of CVE, of multiple transplantations and of
   smoking. Other determinants of CAC were male gender, current statin use
   and history of parathyroidectomy, and other determinants of AoC included
   higher pulse pressure, shorter time under mycophenolate mofetil and
   current use of anti-vitamin-K. Conclusion: The prevalence of both CAC
   and AoC is substantial in RTR. We delineate independent determinants
   either common to both CAC and AoC or specific to one, and known as
   classic or chronic kidney disease related risk factors. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Coronary calcification is a potent predictor of cardiac events. In
   patients with chronic renal disease, both prevalence and intensity of
   coronary calcification are increased. It has remained uncertain whether
   it is the intima of the coronaries or the media that is calcified and
   whether the morphologic details of calcified plaques differ between
   renal and nortrenal patients. Autopsy samples of coronaries were
   obtained from standard sites in 23 renal and 23 age- and gender-matched
   nonuremic patients. Specimens were examined using light and electron
   microscopy, immunohistochemistry, backscatter imaging, and x-ray
   analysis. In coronaries, calcified plaques occupied a similar proportion
   of the intima area in renal versus nortrenal patients (17.3 +/- 11.9
   versus 18.1 +/- 11.9\%) but occupied a significantly higher proportion
   of the media (16.6 +/- 10.6 versus 3.8 +/- 2.31\%). Expression of the
   proteins osteocalcin, C-reactive protein, TGF-beta, and collagen IV was
   significantly more intensive around coronary plaques of renal compared
   with nortrenal patients. The non-plaque-bearing intima of renal patients
   showed minimal staining for fetuin, but fetuin staining was seen
   surrounding calcified plaques. In addition, more pronounced deposition
   of C5b-9 was found around coronary plaques of renal patients, and
   glycophorin deposition pointed to more past intraplaque hemorrhage in
   renal patients. Calcification by electron backscatter analysis is more
   intense in the coronary media, but not if the intima is more intense in
   renal compared with nonrenal patients. A more marked inflammatory
   response in renal patients is suggested by more frequent presence and
   greater intensity of markers of inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Although the determinants of cardiovascular calcium have been well
   described in dialysis patients, the prevalence and predictors in
   predialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) are less known. One hundred six
   patients with CKD from the Renal Research Institute-CKD Study underwent
   multidetector computed tomography for the assessment of calcium
   deposition at the level of coronary arteries, thoracic aorta, aortic
   valve, and mitral valve. Cardiovascular risk factors and renal
   function-related parameters (glomerular filtration rate, glomerular
   filtration rate slope, serum creatinine, serum urea nitrogen,
   hemoglobin, albumin, calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone) were
   included in multivariate regression models to predict cardiovascular
   calcium. Prevalences of calcium deposition at the level of coronary
   arteries, thoracic aorta, aortic valve, and mitral valve were 69\%,
   46\%, 39\%, and 16\%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, coronary
   artery calcium score was predicted by age (p < 0.0001), gender (p =
   0.0001), diabetes (p = 0.024), and history of coronary artery disease (p
   = 0.016), but not by renal function related parameters. Similarly, renal
   function related parameters were not predictive of aortic or valvular
   calcium. In conclusion, predialysis CKD is associated with a high
   prevalence of cardiovascular calcium. The extent of cardiovascular
   calcium in patients with predialysis CKD is related to some of the
   traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis but not to indexes of
   abnormal renal function or progression, in renal dysfunction. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Background. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is an extensive and
   common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The
   aim of this study was to assess prospectively the change in CAC over a
   2-year period and to identify the factors that may be associated with
   CAC progression in ESRD patients.
   Methods. The final analysis was performed on 40 of 43 stable
   haemodialysis patients who initially entered into the study. The study
   population underwent multirow spiral computed tomography to derive CAC
   scores at baseline and after a minimum of 12 months (24 months in 30
   patients, 18 months in four, and 12 months in the remaining six
   patients). To provide a stable estimate that was unbiased with respect
   to the baseline CAC, square root-transformed CAC scores were used for
   the analyses of the changes in CAC.
   Results. The median CAC score was 191 (range, 0-2403) mm(3) at baseline
   and increased to 253 (range, 0-2745) mm(3) at follow-up (P < 0.001) and
   the median annualized change in square root-transformed CAC score was
   1.48 (range, -0.95-8.64) mm(3)/year. The annualized change of the square
   root-transformed CAC score positively correlated with the
   time-integrated levels of C-reactive protein (R = 0.521, P = 0.001),
   phosphorus (R = 0.433, P = 0.005) and calcium x phosphorus product (R =
   0.394, P = 0.012), but did not correlate with the levels of fetuin-A or
   lipid parameters. Even after adjusting for age, gender and baseline CAC
   score, C-reactive protein levels were independently associated with CAC
   progression.
   Conclusion. These data suggest that chronic inflammation as well as
   altered mineral metabolism contributes to a rapid progression of CAC in
   ESRD patients. Additional, larger scale studies are required to confirm
   our findings.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The relationship of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)-derived
   measurements of atherosclerotic plaque to various coronary artery
   disease (CAD) risk factors is not well known. The purpose of this study
   was to examine the relationship of percent coronary luminal stenosis by
   IVUS to other IVUS measures of CAD, as well as the relationship of
   common IVUS measures of CAD to traditional CAD risk factors. We
   hypothesized that one or more IVUS measures of CAD might relate more
   strongly to CAD risk factors than does percent luminal coronary
   stenosis. Methods: The records of 897 consecutive patients (57\% men,
   mean age 62 years) who underwent IVUS investigation of their coronary
   arteries from 1996 through 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. IVUS was
   performed using a 20-MHz probe (Jomed, Rancho Cordoba, CA) and a manual
   pull-back technique to image the coronary arteries. Coronary artery
   remodeling ratio-i.e., the ratio of coronary lesion external elastic
   membrane cross-sectional area (EEM CSA) to proximal reference artery EEM
   CSA; plaque burden-i.e., plaque plus media CSA divided by EEM CSA;
   calcium arc; and percent stenosis of luminal cross-sectional area were
   measured by a single reader. Results: Percent area stenosis, the most
   commonly used IVUS parameter, did not correlate with the other three
   IVUS-derived parameters, nor was it related to any of the CAD risk
   factors considered. In contrast, remodeling ratio was directly
   correlated with plaque burden (r = 0.22, P < 0.001), but inversely
   related to calcium arc (r =-0.13, P = 0.01). IVUS plaque burden was
   significantly correlated with male gender (P < 0.0001) and diabetes
   mellitus (DM) (P = 0.003). In multivariate analyses including age,
   gender, and CAD risk factors, plaque burden was significantly associated
   with age, male gender, and DM, but not with chronic renal failure,
   hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia. The multivariate model also
   revealed that the calcium arc was significantly associated with male
   gender and age. These IVUS findings provide anatomic documentation that
   the traditional CAD risk factors relate more strongly to plaque burden
   than to percent coronary arterial luminal narrowing.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac calcifications are a frequent finding in hemodialysis for
   chronic renal failure. Several factors may play a role in the intimal
   and medial calcification of coronary arteries such as age and some known
   atherogenetic factors. In addition, Fetuin-A has been proposed as a
   protective agent through solubilization of calcium phosphate salt.
   Fetuin-A is also a marker of inflammatory-nutritional state, and its
   changes could be an expression of this condition. The aim of this
   cross-sectional study is to evaluate the relative importance of risk
   factors of calcifications with special regard to Fetuin-A.
   The study was conducted with 132 hemodialysis patients. They were
   subjected to multislice computed tomography for evaluation of calcium
   deposits in the heart. In addition, the patients were sampled for
   evaluation of calcium-phosphate parameters, lipid profile, nutritional
   and inflammatory markers, and also Fetuin-A.
   There was a wide variability of the extent of calcium deposits expressed
   as Agatston score, with only 9.3\% of patients without calcifications.
   Age, hemodialysis age, sex, calcium-phosphate parameters, and lipid
   profile were important risk factors, together with nutritional and
   inflammatory status of the patients. An inverse correlation between
   coronary calcium score and Fetuin-A emerged from a multiple regression
   analysis. However, there was no significant difference in serum Fetuin-A
   among different grades of calcium score. By dividing the patients in
   terfiles of serum Fetuin-A, an association between low levels of
   Fetuin-A and high calcification score was found. Fetuin-A as dependent
   variable was strictly linked to prealbumin serum levels. In addition,
   there was a clear link between cardiac calcification scores and
   inflammatory-nutritional markers. Serum calcium and treatment with
   calcitriol emerged as predictive variables of coronary score.
   Fetuin-A could be involved in the process of calcification both in the
   case of markedly low serum levels, due to decreased prevention of
   calcium phosphate precipitation, and also as a marker of inflammation, a
   well-known risk factor of atherogenesis. Treatment with intravenous
   calcitriol could marginally enhance cardiac calcifications, probably
   through its hypercalcemic effect.}},

Abstract = {{Valvular calcification is common in the setting of end-stage kidney
   disease and is associated with increased risks for cardiovascular
   disease events. It is unknown whether the prevalence of valvular
   calcification is increased in milder kidney disease after accounting for
   cardiovascular risk factors. Participants who attended the sixth
   examination of the Framingham Offspring Study (1995 to 1998) were
   eligible. Kidney function was estimated by GFR using the simplified
   Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation. Mitral annular
   calcification (MAC), aortic sclerosis, and aortic annular calcification
   were assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography. Logistic regression
   was used to examine the odds of valvular calcification among
   participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD; GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73
   m(2)). A total of 3047 participants (52\% women; mean age 59 +/- 10 yr)
   were available for analysis. CKD was present in 8.6\% (n = 262) of the
   sample. Among participants with valve/annular calcification (n = 284;
   9.3\%), 20\% had CKD, compared with 7\% in patients without valvular
   calcification. After adjustment for age, gender, systolic and diastolic
   BP, hypertension treatment, total/HDL cholesterol, body mass index,
   diabetes, smoking status, and cardiovascular disease, participants with
   CKD had a 60\% increased odds of MAC (odds ratio 1.6; 95\% confidence
   interval 1.03 to 2.5). There was no significant association between CKD
   and either aortic sclerosis or aortic annular calcification (odds ratio
   1.1 and 1.1, respectively). After age and gender adjustment, the
   combination of both CKD and MAC was associated with a three-fold
   increased risk for death compared with those with neither condition (P =
   0.0004). In the community, CKD is associated with presence of MAC before
   the onset of ESRD. Further research is warranted to understand whether
   traditional and novel vascular risk factor burden, as well as metabolic
   derangements found in early kidney disease, can account for the CKD-MAC
   association.}},

   69 +/- 16 years, time on dialysis 32 8 27 months) and 12 chronic kidney
   disease stage 4 (CKD-4) patients (age 66 +/- 17 years, uraemia duration
   38 8 16 months). The patients were characterized by a good mineral
   control, as shown by serum phosphate levels (3.6 +/- 8 1.3 mg/dl in
   CKD-4 and 4.3 +/- 1.6 mg/dl in HD patients) and Ca x P product (46 +/-
   17 and 49 +/- 16 mg(2)/dl(2), respectively). The parathyroid hormone
   levels were higher in HD than CKD-4 patients (p < 0.0001). A TC score >
   400 was found to be highly prevalent in both groups. Significantly more
   HD patients (62.5\%) showed cardiac calcification than CKD-4 patients
   (33\%; p = 0.01). The patients were matched for TC scores higher or
   lower than 400. The two groups differed by gender (p < 0.05), age (p =
   0.026), frequency of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), uraemia follow-up
   period (p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (p =
   0.009), Ca x P product (p = 0.002), parathyroid hormone level (p <
   0.0001), and corrected QT dispersion (p < 0.0001). The QT interval was
   higher in HD and CKD-4 patients with higher TC scores (approximately
   11\%), but QT interval dispersion was significantly higher in patients
   with TC scores > 400. QT dispersion showed a linear correlation with TC
   scores in both groups (r = 0.899 and p < 0.0001 and r = 0.901 and p <
   0.0001). Male gender, age, time (months) of uraemia, low-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin, calcium ! phosphorus product,
   parathyroid hormone, and TC score are important determinants of QT
   dispersion. Our data show that it is possible to link dysrhythmias and

Abstract = {{The risk factors for vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients
   include duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, aging,
   hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and calcium or vitamin D
   supplementation. This study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of
   and risk factors for VC in our dialysis population.
   Methods. One hundred twenty-nine chronic dialysis patients underwent
   plain x-rays of the hands for VC. Patients were grouped as either
   positive (PVC) or negative (NVC) for VC. Age, gender, duration of
   dialysis, presence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM),
   oral calcium, and la-hydroxyvitamin D-3 supplement, serum levels of
   calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), calcium phosphorus product (CaxP),
   alkaline phosphates (ALP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were
   compared between the two groups.
   Results. Thirty-four patients (26.35\%) showed VC. There were no
   differences between PVC and NVC patients for duration of dialysis (38.4
   +/- 27.7 for PVC and 34.6 +/- 31.2 months for NVC, P = .80), levels of
   serum Ca (P = .26), P (P = .19), CaxP (P = .33), ALP (P = .89), or iPTH
   (P = .24). Similarly, oral calcium and 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D-3 intake
   were not different between the two groups (P = .971 and P = .3710
   respectively). Compared to NVC patients, PVC patients were older (56.3
   +/- 10.4 versus 47.5 +/- 16.1 years, P = .008) and had a greater
   incidence of NIDDM (17/34 PVC and diabetic versus 20/95 NVC, P = .001).
   In conclusion, for patients with a medium length of dialysis, the
   duration of dialysis as well as the doses of calcium salts and of 1
   alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 were not significantly associated with vascular
   calcifications, but it was not possible to exclude a role for these and
   other factors in patients with longer dialysis.}},

Title = {{Low fetuin-A levels are associated with cardiovascular death: Impact of
   variations in the gene encoding fetuin}},
Journal = {{KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Background. Vascular calcification is common among end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) patients and a central characteristic of the
   atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease observed in dialysis patients.
   Fetuin-A, a circulating calcium - regulatory glycoprotein that inhibits
   vascular calcification, is associated with inflammation and outcome in
   dialysis patients. In the present study, we evaluated the association
   between fetuin-A, clinical phenotype, and outcome, as well as the impact
   of fetuin gene (AHSG) polymorphisms on the protein product and outcome.
   Methods. In a cohort of 258 (161 mates) ESRD patients starting renal
   replacement therapy {[}glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 6.8 +/- 0.2
   mL/min] aged 52 +/- 1 years the following parameters were studied:
   presence of malnutrition (subjective global assessment), comorbidity
   {[}diabetes mellitus and clinical manifest cardiovascular disease
   (CVD)], carotid plaques (N = 101), hs-CRP, fetuin-A, S-albumin,
   interleukin (IL)-6, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
   AHSG gene (N = 215) at amino acid positions Thr248Met (C-->T), Thr256Ser
   (C--> G), Asp276Asn (G--> A), and Arg317Cys (C-->T).
   Results. Both all-cause (P < 0.001) and cardiovascular (P < 0.001)
   mortality were associated with low fetuin-A levels independently of age,
   smoking, diabetes, S-albumin, CVD, and inflammation (CRP >= 10 mg/(L)
   over bar). Inflamed (0.199 vs. 0.247 g/L; P < 0.01) and malnourished
   (0.207 vs. 0.262 g/L; P < 0.05) patients had significantly lower median
   fetuin-A than noninflamed and well-nourished ESRD patients,
   respectively. In a logistic regression model (N = 101), fetuin-A was
   significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the presence of carotid plaques
   independently of age, CVD, diabetes, S-albumin, gender, and
   inflammation. Significant correlations were observed between fetuin-A
   and both S-albumin (Rho = 0.30, P < 0.0001) and IL-6 (Rho = -0.21; P <
   0.01). Patients with the AHSG 256Ser allele had lower serum fetuin-A
   levels, and higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rate if they
   were inflamed.
   Conclusion. The present study shows that a low fetuin-A level is
   associated with malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (carotid
   plaques), as well as with increased cardiovascular and all-cause
   mortality. Because the present study demonstrates an effect of
   variations in the AHSG gene on both circulating fetuin-A levels and
   outcome, this indicates that ESRD patients with the AHSG 256Ser allele
   are at risk of accelerated vascular calcification.}},

Abstract = {{Increased intima-media thickness of the carotid arteries (cIMT) has been
   found in young adults with childhood-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   The disease stage at which these patients first develop abnormalities of
   arterial texture is unknown. The objective of this study was to
   determine the onset and character of arterial changes in children aged
   10 to 20 yr with different stages of CKD and to identify risk factors
   for early arteriopathy. High-resolution ultrasonography was conducted of
   common cIMT and femoral superficial artery IMT. Fifty-five children with
   stages 2 to 4 CKD (GFR 51 +/- 31 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), 37 on dialysis,
   and 34 after renal transplantation (Rtx; GFR 73 +/- 31 ml/min per 1.73
   m(2)) were studied. Control subjects were 270 healthy children, matched
   for age and gender. Compared with control subjects, cIMT, femoral
   superficial artery IMT (both as absolute values and as SD score of
   median of normal value), wall cross-sectional area, and lumen
   cross-sectional area of carotid artery were significantly increased in
   all patient groups and most markedly abnormal in dialysis patients. cIMT
   in CKD and Rtx patients was significantly lower in comparison with
   dialysis patients. cIMT correlated with mean past serum Ca x P product,
   the cumulative dose of calcium-based phosphate binders, and the
   time-averaged mean calcitriol dose. The cumulative phosphate binder
   intake, time-averaged Ca X P product, and young age were independent
   predictors of an increased cIMT. In children with CKD, thickening of IMT
   occurs early in the course of disease and is most marked in dialyzed
   patients. The changes may be partly reversible after Rtx.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Background. The Treat-to-Goal Study found that sevelamer slowed the
   progression of coronary calcification in patients on hemodialysis
   compared to calcium-based phosphate binders. To understand the
   implications of this effect for cardiovascular events, risk equations
   are needed.
   Methods. Data on 179 patients on hemodialysis treated at one center in
   France included biochemical values during the year prior to study entry,
   patient characteristics, and cardiovascular events over an average of 4
   years. As arterial calcification was evaluated ultrasonographically and
   quantified using a 0 to 4 score, an equation relating this to the
   electron-beam tomography (EBT)-based calcification score used in the
   trial was developed and applied to all patients. The estimated scores
   were then used in survival and Cox proportional hazards analyses of
   cardiovascular events in relation to the degree of calcification,
   controlling for other characteristics.
   Results. Mean age at inclusion was 54 years, dialysis vintage 70 months,
   average follow-up 49 months; 32\% suffered an event. The calcification
   score, diabetes, C-reactive protein (CRP), diastolic blood pressure,
   gender, smoking and hypertension are independent predictors of
   cardiovascular risk. The resulting equation indicates that, relative to
   a calcification score below 400, the risk of an initial event increases
   44\% for a score of 600, and more than doubles for a score of 1000.
   Conclusion. In the absence of long-term follow-up studies, these
   equations permit quantification of the expected long-term clinical
   consequences of the impact of various phosphate binders on vascular
   calcification. Together with resource use and cost information, these
   equations are key inputs for formal cost-effectiveness analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Serum phosphorus (P) and the product of serum calcium x
   serum P (Ca x P), are frequently elevated in end-stage renal disease
   patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Elevated P and Ca x P have
   been associated with vascular calcification in dialysis patients.
   Objective: To examine the role of P and Ca x P as risk factors for
   incident peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in HD patients with
   pre-existing CVD. Methods: This nested case-control study is drawn from
   the I I incident PVD events reported in the cohort of the Secondary
   prevention with antioxidants of cardiovascular disease in end-stage
   renal disease (SPACE): a randomized placebo-controlled trial. PVD was
   defined clinically and confirmed ultrasonographically. Each individual
   with a PVD event was matched for SPACE treatment group (vitamin E or
   placebo), age (in 4-year categories) and gender with two individuals who
   had no CVD end point during the follow-up period. Results: Serum P and
   Ca x P levels were significantly higher in PVD patients than in
   controls. In univariate logistic regression analysis, only serum P
   predicted PVD in this population (OR 2.02, 95\% CI 1.07 - 3.8 1, p =
   0.03). In multivariate analysis, adjustment was made for variables
   dissimilar by PVD status including underlying renal disease, diabetes,
   smoking, history of angina pectoris, prescription for vitamin D-3,
   erythropoietin, calcium channel blockers and aspirin. In this model,
   serum P remained the only significant predictor of incident PVD (OR 2.4,
   95\% CI 1.01 - 5.74, p = 0.04). Conclusions: Findings of the present
   study are consistent with a role for serum P and Ca x P in the

Abstract = {{Background. Atherosclerotic artery disease is a common condition in
   patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD); however, there are few
   published data on the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in
   nondialyzed patients with renal insufficiency. The ankle-brachial index
   (ABI) is a simple, noninvasive, and reliable method to assess PAD.
   Methods and Results. Prevalence of PAD using ABI was investigated in 102
   patients referred for the first time to a nephrology clinic with CKD in
   stages 3 to 5 of the K/DOQI classification, and with no previous
   diagnosis of PAD. Patients with ABI < 0.9 were considered positive for
   PAD.
   A total of 64\% of the patients were male. The mean age was 70 +/- 11
   (range 58-84) years, and the estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) was
   35 +/- 12 (range 6-59) mL/min(-1). Of the total sample, 26\% were
   diabetics, 10\% active smokers, 48\% ex-smokers, and 29\% had a
   diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD), 15\% had been previously
   diagnosed of stroke, and 17\% had signs and symptoms compatible with
   intermittent claudication, which had passed unnoticed. Thirty-two
   percent of patients had an ABI < 0.9 (mean 0.64 +/- 0.25). Of these
   patients with PAD, 84\% were men (P < 0.005), and only 30\% presented a
   clinical picture compatible with intermittent claudication. Absolute
   risk of CHD according to the Framingham 1998 score was higher in the PAD
   group (19.3\% +/- 6 vs.13.1\% +/- 8; P = 0.01). Patients with PAD were
   older (75 +/- 6 vs. 66 +/- 11 years, P = 0.000), and had worse renal
   function (CrCl 30.8 +/- 12 vs. 37 +/- 10.7 mL.min(-1), P = 0.016)
   compared to patients without PAD but no differences were found in
   cholesterol levels (total, HDL, LDL), calcium, phosphorus, or PTH. In
   the logistic regression analysis, independent indicators of PAD risk
   were male sex, age, and lower CrCl.
   Twelve percent of patients had an ABI greater than or equal to1.3,
   suggestive of parietal arterial calcifications. In these patients,
   systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure were lower (126 +/- 18 vs.
   150 +/- 27, P = 0.005, and 52 +/- 13 vs. 68 +/- 25 mm Hg, P = 0.044),
   i-PTH levels were higher (228 +/- 267 vs. 117 +/- 63 pg/mL, P = 0.01),
   and a larger proportion of this group was treated with calcitriol (34\%
   vs. 13\%) compared to patients with a normal ABI.
   Conclusion. A high prevalence of PAD, considered as an ABI < 0.9, was
   demonstrated in nondialyzed patients with CKD. This was related with
   age, male sex, and higher degree of renal insufficiency, while the
   presence of ABI greater than or equal to 1.3 was associated with a
   greater degree of hyperparathyroidism. These data show the need to carry
   out routine ABI determinations in patients with CKD for early detection
   of peripheral arterial disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) can be a fatal
   complication in dialysis patients. Intradialytic hypotension is usually
   the precipitating factor. The occurrence of 16 cases in 5 years
   (1998-2002), compared with only 4 in previous years, led us to
   investigate other risk factors contributing to NOMI. A control group of
   stable hemodialysis patients was used for comparison. Results: 20
   patients were studied: 17 diagnosed surgically, and 3 clinically. The
   mean age was 70.8 +/- 1.8 years, and the male:female ratio 7:13.
   Nineteen patients were on hemodialysis. Clinically overt atherosclerosis
   was present in 17 patients. Preceding dialysis-associated hypotension
   was identified in all patients studied and access thrombosis in 6
   patients. In all patients, abdominal pain was the presenting symptom.
   Initial abdominal examination was unimpressive in 16 patients. The
   hemoconcentration, leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis were the most
   prominent laboratory findings. 5/11 abdominal sonograms showed
   intestinal pathology. 2/3 angiographies were diagnostic. Three patients
   responded to early fluid challenge and did not require surgery.
   Pathology was related to the area of the superior mesenteric artery in
   all 15 patients operated. Twelve (60\%) patients died from the event.
   The 1-year mortality rate was 17/20 patients (85\%). Possible
   contributing factors, other than dialysis-associated hypotension,
   included: high-dose recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) therapy
   (179 35 vs. 116 +/- 10 U/kg/week in the control group, p < 0.05);
   metastatic calcifications (abdominal aorta 14/14, aortic valve 11/18;
   medial calcification of mesenteric arteries in 2/11 pathology
   specimens); digoxin, and hypoalbuminemia. Conclusions: The increased
   incidence of NOMI in dialysis patients may be related to overly
   aggressive rhEPO therapy and the unsuspected presence of mesenteric
   arterial medial calcifications. Identification of patients at risk,
   prevention of intradialytic hypotension and a controlled increase in dry
   weight may help to reduce the incidence of NOMI in chronically dialyzed
   patients. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.}},

   to uremic bone disease, vascular calcification, and a higher risk of
   death. Parathyroidectomy (PTX) can dramatically reduce parathyroid
   hormone (PTH) and phosphate levels; however, the relationship between
   PTX and survival is not known.
   Methods. We conducted an observational matched cohort study utilizing
   data from the United States Renal Database System (USRDS) in which 4558
   patients undergoing a first PTX while on hemodialysis or peritoneal
   dialysis were individually matched by age, race, gender, cause of ESRD,
   dialysis duration, prior transplantation status, and dialysis modality
   to 4558 control patients who did not undergo PTX. Patients were followed
   from the date of PTX until they died or were lost to follow-up.
   Results. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate following PTX was
   3.1\%. Long-term relative risks of death among patients undergoing PTX
   were estimated to be 10\% to 15\% lower than those of matched control
   patients not undergoing surgery. Survival curves between the 2 groups
   crossed 587 days following PTX. Median survival was 53.4 months (95\%
   CI: 51.2-56.4) in the PTX group, and 46.8 months (95\% CI: 44.7-48.9) in
   the control group.
   Conclusion. PTX was associated with higher short-term, and lower
   long-term, mortality rates among U. S. patients receiving chronic
   dialysis. Measures to attenuate SHPTH may play an important role in
   reducing mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: As adipose tissue releases inflammatory cytokines, obesity is
   associated with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the general
   population. We examined the cross-sectional association of body mass
   index (BMI) with CRP in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting and Participants: Ninety-four CKD patients with varying levels
   of renal function seen at the University of Utah outpatient renal clinic
   were studied.
   Methods: Data on demographics (age, gender, race), comorbiclity
   (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, myocardial infarction/angina,
   cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, and smoking) and
   anthropometry (height and weight) were obtained by patient interview and
   chart reviews. High-sensitivity CRIP was measured by the N-latex assay
   on a BN II nephelometer.
   Main Outcome Measure: Risk factors of high CRP.
   Results: In a multivariable logistic regression model, when compared
   with patients with a BMI < 25, the odds of CRP 3.0 mg/L were 2.5-fold
   (95\% CI, 1.02 to 5.99) higher in patients with BMI greater than or
   equal to 30. In a stepwise multiple linear regression model, IBMI
   (regression coefficient {[}01 0.06; 95\% CI, 0.03 to 0.1; P <.01), serum

   0.01; 95\% CI, -0.001 to 0.03; P =.05) were significantly associated
   with log transformed CRP.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that as in the general population, in
   CKID patients, obesity, a traditional risk factor for atherosclerosis,
   is associated with inflammation, a novel risk factor for
   atherosclerosis. (C) 2004 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Arterial calcification is a common problem in patients with
   chronic kidney disease, and has been associated with adverse clinical
   outcomes. The goal of the present study was to evaluate whether pelvic
   artery calcifications are associated with technical failure of
   arteriovenous thigh grafts in haemodialysis patients.
   Methods. From 1 January 1999 to 30 June 2002, thigh grafts were placed
   in 54 haemodialysis patients who had exhausted all options for permanent
   vascular access in the upper extremities. Perioperative computed
   tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained in 32 of the
   patients for diagnostic purposes unrelated to vascular access planning.
   Two radiologists, who were blinded to the graft outcomes, scored the
   vascular calcifications on CT of the distal aorta, common iliac,
   external iliac and common femoral arteries on a semi-quantitative
   5-point scale. The association between technical graft failure
   (inability to complete the anastomosis) and the vascular calcification
   score was analysed.
   Results. There was a high inter-observer agreement in scoring vascular
   calcification (kappa=0.801). Among 26 patients with absent or mild
   pelvic arterial calcifications (grade 1-2) on CT, none (0\%) experienced
   technical graft failure. In contrast, three of six patients (50\%) with
   moderate to severe calcification (grade 3-5) had technical graft
   failures (P = 0.004 by Fisher's exact test). The cumulative I year graft
   patency was lower in the group with grade 3-5 calcification (33 vs 81\%,
   P = 0.09). The two groups were similar in age, gender, race, diabetes,
   duration of dialysis, serum calcium, serum phosphorus and serum
   parathyroid hormone.
   Conclusion. There is a strong association between pelvic artery
   calcifications and technical failure of thigh grafts. The presence of
   moderate to severe vascular calcification is predictive of poor
   cumulative 1 year graft patency.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Coronary artery calcification scores (CACS) calculated by
   electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) have been correlated with
   atherosclerotic burden in the non-uraemic population. However, the
   validity of this test in. chronic haemodialysis patients (HD) is
   currently uncertain. In the present cross-sectional study, associations
   between carotid atherosclerosis and coronary calcification in HD
   patients are investigated.
   Methods. We studied 79 chronic HD patients (39 male, 40 female; mean
   age, 45 +/- 12 years). The mean time on HD was 68 +/- 54 months (range,
   6-187 months). In these patients, we measured serum calcium, phosphorus,
   total cholesterol, cholesterol subgroups and iPTH levels. EBCT,
   echocardiography, and high-resolution B-mode carotid Doppler
   ultrasonography were also performed.
   Results. Plaque-positive HD patients had significantly higher CACS than
   plaque-negative patients (851 +/- 199 vs 428 +/- 185, mean +/- SE, P =
   0.006). Coronary calcification scores were correlated with serum
   phosphorus (r = 0.37; P = 0.001). Only 8 of the 24 HD patients without
   coronary calcification had carotid plaques (33\%), whereas 34 of the 53
   patients with coronary calcification had carotid plaques (64\%) (P =
   0.015). Carotid plaque scores were correlated with CACS (r = 0.40; P =
   0.001). A stepwise linear regression (model r = 0.72; P < 0.001)
   revealed that CACS (log-transformed data of CACS) was associated with
   age (P < 0.001), time on dialysis (P = 0.004), serum phosphorus level (P
   = 0.016) and carotid plaque scores (P = 0.037).
   Conclusions. Atherosclerosis is independently associated with coronary
   artery calcification and with hyperphosphataemia in chronic HD patients.
   CACS appeared to be predictive of both coronary atherosclerosis and
   carotid atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Pre-operative dialysis-dependent renal failure (DDRF) is a
   predictor of morbidity and mortality following coronary artery bypass
   grafting surgery (CABG). Whether this is due in part to a more diffuse
   coronary atherosclerotic burden in these patients is unknown. The
   purpose of this study was to compare coronary atherosclerotic disease
   burden in patients with and without pre-existing DDRF undergoing CABG.
   Methods: From a retrospective analysis of a single-centre cardiac
   surgical database, consecutive DDRF patients undergoing isolated CABG (n
   = 35) were matched to 70 non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) patients without
   renal failure by procedure, age, sex, functional status, ejection
   fraction, number of diseased vessels, and diabetes. Pre-operative
   angiograms were analyzed by a single, blinded adjudicator using a
   modification of a previously published coronary diffuseness score
   (range: 0-45). Angiographic scores and baseline and outcome
   characteristics were compared using X 2 tests, Fisher's Exact tests, and
   t-tests as appropriate. Results: No statistical differences were found
   among pre-operative characteristics between the two groups. The mean
   angiographic coronary diffuseness scores for the dialysis and
   non-dialysis groups were 18.2 and 20.6, respectively (p = 0.13).
   Transfusion was more frequent (77 vs. 23\%,p < 0.0001) and median length
   of stay longer (9 vs. 7 days, p = 0.02) in the DDRF group. There were no
   differences in the number of distal anastomoses performed in the two
   groups. Low rates of peri-operative myocardial infarction, stroke,
   re-operation, and in-hospital mortality were observed in both groups.
   Conclusions: Objective quantification revealed that patients with DDRF
   undergoing CABG did not have a greater coronary artery atherosclerosis
   disease burden than matched controls who did not have pre-operative
   DDRF. This may be due to pre-operative patient selection bias. The
   increased morbidity and mortality of CABG in patients with DDRF is more
   likely to be due to the multiple adverse systemic effects of renal
   failure and dialysis on the cardiovascular system as opposed to
   diffuseness of distal coronary disease. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background. Although end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been associated
   with accelerated vascular disease of the cerebral circulation, there are
   no prior studies that have estimated the risk of hemorrhagic and
   ischemic stroke among the United States dialysis population relative to
   the general population.
   Methods. We performed a population-based cohort study to compare rates
   of hospitalized ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke among incident dialysis
   patients in the United States Renal System database and non-ESRD
   subjects from the general population identified in the National Hospital
   Discharge Survey.
   Results. After adjustment for age, gender, and race, estimated rates of
   hospitalized stroke were markedly higher for dialysis patients compared
   to the general population. The age-adjusted relative risk (RR) of stroke
   among dialysis patients compared to the general population was 6.1
   {[}95\% Confidence Interval (95\% CI) 5.1, 7.1] for Caucasian males, 4.4
   (95\% CI 3.3, 5.5) for African American males, 9.7 (95\%CI 8.2, 11.2)
   for Caucasians females and 6.2 (95\%CI 4.8, 7.6) for African American
   females. When considered as separate outcomes, hospitalization rates for
   hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke were both markedly elevated for subjects
   treated with dialysis (ischemic, RR = 4.3 to 10.1; hemorrhagic, RR = 4.1
   to 6.7).
   Conclusion. Incident dialysis patients are at markedly higher risk for
   hospitalized stroke when compared to the general population. Although
   prior public health initiatives have focused primarily on cardiac
   disease among patients treated with dialysis, our data suggest that new
   initiatives are needed to control the high risk of stroke in this
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have highly
   prevalent and severe vascular and valvular calcification. We undertook
   this study to test the hypothesis that vascular and valvular
   calcification begins and is often severe long before diabetic renal
   disease progresses to ESRD.
   Methods. A total of 32 nondialyzed individuals with type 2 diabetes
   mellitus and diabetic renal disease (albumin excretion rate >30 mug/min)
   {[}mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 49.8 +/- 6.1 mL/min/1.73 m(2)]
   were identified and compared with a group of 18 normoalbuminuric
   diabetics. We used 3:1 matching to identify 95 nondiabetic controls
   without renal disease, matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and the
   presence/absence of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and known coronary
   artery disease (CAD).
   Results. Using electron beam computed tomography (CT), the prevalence of
   coronary artery calcification was significantly greater among diabetic
   renal disease individuals (prevalence, 94\% vs. 59\%, P < 0.001; median
   score, 238 vs. 10, P < 0.001) than the nondiabetic controls. The
   coronary artery calcification scores were significantly more severe
   among diabetic renal disease individuals than either the diabetic or
   nondiabetic controls. Among individuals with diabetic renal disease, the
   coronary artery calcification and aortic wall calcification scores were
   several-fold greater among those with known CAD than among those
   without. There was also a significantly greater prevalence of aortic and
   mitral valve calcification among diabetic renal disease individuals than
   nondiabetic controls (aortic, 23\% vs. 6\%, P = 0.03; mitral, 25\% vs.
   2\%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis using all three groups reproduced
   these findings and also consistently identified age and diabetic renal
   disease as additional predictors for the presence or severity of
   coronary artery and aortic wall calcification.
   Conclusion. In this first, systematic analysis among nondialyzed
   individuals with diabetic renal disease, these data demonstrate that
   vascular and valvular calcification is present and often severe long
   before the disease progresses to ESRD. The data also suggest that the
   coronary artery and aortic wall calcification may represent
   atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In a retrospective study, we compared two groups of
   consecutive patients operated by the same team during the year 2000 for
   coronary artery disease with the use of extracorporeal circulation
   (group 1, n = 230) or on the beating heart using the Octopus 11 plus
   stabiliser (group 2, n = 228). High-risk patients were identified by a
   EuroSCORE plus 6. EuroSCORE definitions and predicted risk models were
   utilized to compare the variables of the groups.
   Methods: There were no significant differences between the preoperative
   variables of the groups in age, gender, left ventricular function,
   diabetes and peripheral vascular and renal disease as is indicated by
   the Euroscore (resp. 4.7/5.1 p = 0.107). Calcification of the ascending
   aorta and chronic obstructive lung disease were statistically
   significant more prevalent in the beating heart group. No differences in
   preoperative variables in the high-risk patients group (Euroscore
   8.5/8.1 p = 0.356) except for calcification of the ascending aorta.
   Results: All patients underwent a full revascularisation through a
   midline sternotomy. Significant more distal anastomoses were performed
   in group 1 (3.7 per patient (1-6)) with regard to group 2 (2.9 per
   patient (1-6)). Anesthesia, postoperative treatment and follow up were
   equal for both groups. A significant lower incidence of atrial
   fibrillation (p = 0.010), shorter ICU stay (p = 0.031) and renal
   insufficiency (p = 0.033) was reported in group 2. In the low risk
   group, we could not diagnose any difference between the two groups,
   except for atrial fibrillation. The benefits of the beating heart
   surgery however were more pronounced in the high-risk patent as is
   indicated by a significant reduction of the ICU stay by 1 day (3.5d/2.5d
   (p = 0.028)), better preservation of the renal function (p = 0.017) and
   a significant reduction of the length of hospital stay by more than two
   days (p = 0.040). A lower incidence of atrial fibrillation, however not
   significant.
   Conclusion: In our experience, beating heart surgery is a safe
   alternative for conventional coronary. heart surgery. High-risk patients
   do benefit most from this technique. It became our first choice in the
   elderly patient and patients presenting with higher co-morbidities. (C)

   peritoneal dialysis (mean +/- SD duration of dialysis, 39 +/- 31 mo) to
   screen for calcification of the aortic valve, mitral valve, or both.
   Valvular calcification was present in 62 patients. During the mean
   follow-up of 17.9 mo (range, 0.6 to 33.9 mo), 46 deaths (50\% of
   cardiovascular causes) were observed. Overall 1-yr survival was 70\% and
   93\% for patients with and without valvular calcification (P < 0.0001,
   log-rank test). Cardiovascular mortality was 22\% and 3\% for patients
   with and without valvular calcification (P < 0.0001). Multivariable Cox
   regression analysis showed that cardiac valve calcification was
   predictive of an increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio {[}HR],
   2.50; 95\% CI, 1.32 to 4.76; P = 0.005) and cardiovascular death (HR
   5.39; 95\% CI, 2.16 to 13.48; P = 0.0003) independent of age, male
   gender, dialysis duration, C-reactive protein, diabetes, and
   atherosclerotic vascular disease. Eighty-nine percent of patients with
   both valvular calcification and atherosclerotic vascular disease, 23\%
   of patients with valvular calcification only, 21\% of patients with
   atherosclerotic vascular disease only, and 13\% of patients with neither
   complication died at 1-yr (P < 0.0005). The cardiovascular death rate
   was 85\% for patients with both complications, 13\% for patients with
   valvular calcification only, 14\% for patients with atherosclerotic
   vascular disease only, and 5\% for those with neither complication (P <
   0.0005). The number of calcified valves was associated with all-cause
   mortality (P < 0.0005) and cardiovascular death (P < 0.0005). One-year
   all-cause mortality was 57\% for patients with both aortic and mitral
   valves calcified, 40\% for those with either valve calcified, and 15\%
   for those with neither valve calcified. In conclusion, cardiac valve
   calcification is a powerful predictor for mortality and cardiovascular
   deaths in long-term dialysis patients. Valvular calcification by itself
   has similar prognostic importance as the presence of atherosclerotic
   vascular disease. Its coexistence with other atherosclerotic
   complications indicates more severe disease and has the worst outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Dialysis patients have bone metabolic disorders and a higher prevalence
   of fractures, principally peripheral fractures, However, there are few
   studies focusing on the prevalence of vertebral fractures. Moreover,
   aortic calcifications are very common and are an independent predictive
   factor of vascular morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study
   was to assess the prevalence of vertebral fractures and vascular
   calcifications in haemodialysis (HD) patients (n = 99), in comparison
   with a random sample of general population of similar age and from the
   same geographical area (n = 624) and study their relationship with
   clinical, biochemical and therapeutical data.
   The prevalence of vertebral fractures in HD patients and general
   Population was 19.1\% and 24.1\% respectively (non-significant
   statistical differences). In both, sexes, the presence of vertebral
   fractures was positively associated with age, mean maximum Ca, mean
   maximum CaxP. In women, time in HD was positively associated as well.
   On the other hand, the prevalence of aortic calcifications was much
   higher in HD patients (77.9\% vs 37.5\%, p < 0.001). HD was a risk
   factor for aortic calcification in women {[}OR = 7,7 (IC 95\% =
   2.6-22.9)] as in men {[}OR = 5 (IC 95\% = 1.9-12.9)]. Severe vascular
   calcifications were more frequent in HD patients, it reached 57,4\%
   compared with 17\% of general Population (p < 0.001). Both, in women
   (64,5\% vs 13,3\% p < 0,001) and in men (51,4\% vs 20,9\%), respectively
   (p < 0, 00 1).
   In conclusion, the prevalence of vertebral fractures was similar in HD
   patients and in general population. Nevertheless, frequency and severity
   of aortic calcifications was higher in HD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity
   and mortality in chronic hemodialysed patients. The aim of our study was
   to determine the prevalence of cardiovascular calcifications in dialysed
   patients and to evaluate their risk factors.
   Methods: we did a transversal study in 86 chronically hemodialysed
   patients in the hemodialysis department, lbn Sina university hospital
   (Rabat). All patients, 44 men and 42 females, mean age 42 +/- 15.5 years
   were hemodialysed for more than one year.
   Findings: the prevalence of cardiovascular calcifications was 24.5\%.
   Chronic hemodialysed patients with cardiovascular calcifications were
   older (50.5 years +/- 15.4 vs 39 years +/- 14.6; p = 0.003). They had a
   long hemodialysis duration (81 months 51 Vs 59 months +/- 43; p = 0.05)
   and a higher calcium plasmatic concentration 27 +/- 0.15 vs 2.1 +/- 0.19

   18/3 vs 26/39; p = 0.0002). Multivariate analysis showed, as an
   independent predictor, of cardiovascular calcifications, the old age (p
   = 0.01).
   Cardiovascular calcifications seem uncommon in our hemodialysis
   patients. Older age, longer hemodialysis duration and male gender are
   risk factors.
   The use of low doses carbonate, vitamin D and low milk products diet may
   explain this low prevalence.}},

   over 40 yr of age with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). As no data exist
   on vascular changes in young adults with ESRD since childhood, a
   long-term outcome study was performed. All living Dutch adult patients
   with onset of ESRD between 1972 and 1992 at age 0 to 14 yr were invited
   for carotid artery and cardiac ultrasound and BP measurements. Data on
   clinical characteristics were collected by review of all medical charts.
   Carotid ultrasound data were compared with those of 48 age-matched and
   gender-matched healthy controls. Carotid artery and cardiac ultrasound
   was performed in 130 out of 187 eligible patients. Mean age was 29.0
   (20.7 to 40.6) yr. Compared with controls, patients had a similar intima
   media thickness but a reduced mean arterial wall distensibility DC (40.0
   versus 45.0 kPa(-1). 10(-3); 95\% CI, -9.1 to -0.8; P < 0.001), an

Abstract = {{Background. Patients on dialysis have a disproportionately high rate of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the incidence and risk factors
   for incident acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have not been previously
   assessed in dialysis patients.
   Methods. We analyzed the United States Renal Data System (USRDS)
   Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study (DMMS) Wave II in a historical
   cohort study of ACS. Data from 3374 patients who started dialysis in
   1996 with valid follow-up times were available for analysis, censored at
   the time of renal transplantation and followed until March 2000. Cox
   regression analysis was used to model factors associated with time to
   first hospitalization for ACS (ICD9 code 410.x or 411.x) adjusted for
   comorbidities, demographic factors, baseline laboratory values, blood
   pressures and cholesterol levels, type of vascular access, dialysis
   adequacy, and cardioprotective medications (angiotensin-converting
   enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, HMG-CoA reductase
   inhibitors (statins), beta blockers, and aspirin). Follow-up was 2.19
   +/- 1.14 years.
   Results. The incidence of ACS was 29/1000 person-years. Factors
   associated with ACS were older age, the extreme high and low ranges of
   serum cholesterol level, history of coronary heart disease (CHD), male
   gender, and diabetes. No cardioprotective medications including statins
   had a significant association with ACS in this study. However,
   medications known to reduce mortality after ACS were used in less than
   50\% of patients with known CHD at the start of the study, and statins
   were used in less than 10\% of patients with CHD.
   Conclusions. Dialysis patients had similar risk factors for ACS compared
   to the general population. Cardioprotective medications were not
   associated with a significant benefit, possibly due to their striking
   underutilization in this at-risk population.}},

Abstract = {{Aim/hypothesis. Although derangements of calcium and phosphate control
   have been emphasized as important risk factors for vascular
   calcification in nondiabetic haemodialysis patients, similar risk
   factors for diabetic haemodialysis patients are not known. We compared
   factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification between
   haemodialysis patients with and without diabetes.
   Methods. We examined 421 patients on maintenance haemodialysis. There
   were 89 patients with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus
   (53 men and 36 women, 62 +/- 10 years old) and 332 patients without
   diabetes (192 men and 140 women, 59 +/- 13 years old). Hand
   roentgenography was carried out, and visible vascular calcification of
   the hand arteries was evaluated.
   Results. There were 42 diabetic patients and 45 nondiabetic patients
   with vascular calcification. The prevalence of vascular calcification in
   diabetic patients (47.1\%) was higher than in non-diabetic patients
   (13.6\%) (p<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression, the main
   factors affecting vascular calcification in non-diabetic patients were
   advanced age, longer duration of haemodialysis, increased phosphate
   concentrations, male gender, and lower predialysis diastolic pressure.
   In diabetic patients, predictors for vascular calcification were higher
   values of HbA(1C) and longer duration of haemodialysis. In diabetic
   patients, a 1\% increase in HbA(1C) increased the risk of calcification
   by 2.1-fold (95\% CI 1.282-3.575, p=0.0029).
   Conclusion/interpretation. We have shown that poor glycaemic control,
   rather than calcium and phosphate concentrations, is a predictor of
   peripheral vascular calcification in diabetic patients on haemodialysis.
   This study emphasizes that glycaemic control remains critical even in
   diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES We sought to determine clinical and laboratory correlates of
   calcification of the coronary arteries, aorta and mitral and aortic
   valves in adult subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving
   hemodialysis.
   BACKGROUND Vascular calcification is known to be a risk factor for
   ischemic heart disease in non-uremic individuals. Patients with ESRD
   experience accelerated vascular calcification, due at least in part to
   dysregulation of mineral metabolism. Clinical correlates of the extent
   of calcification in ESRD have not been identified. Moreover, the
   clinical relevance of calcification as measured by, electron-beam
   tomography, (EBT) has not been determined in the ESRD population.
   METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 205 maintenance
   hemodialysis patients who received baseline EBT for evaluation of
   vascular and valvular calcification. We compared subjects with and
   without clinical evidence of atherosclerotic vascular disease and
   determined correlates of the extent of vascular and valvular
   calcification using multivariable linear regression and proportional
   odds logistic regression analyses.
   RESULTS The median coronary artery calcium score was 595 (interquartile
   range, 76 to 1,600), values consistent with a high risk of obstructive
   coronary artery disease in the general population. The coronary artery
   calcium scores were directly related to the prevalence of myocardial
   infarction (p < 0.0001) and angina (p < 0.0001), and the aortic calcium
   scores were directly, related to the prevalence of claudication (p =
   0.001) and aortic aneurysm (p = 0.02). The extent of coronary
   calcification was more pronounced with older age, mate gender, white
   race, diabetes, longer dialysis vintage and higher serum concentrations
   of calcium and phosphorus. Total cholesterol (and high-density
   lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein subfractions), triglycerides,
   hemoglobin and albumin were not significantly related to the extent of
   coronary artery calcification. Only dialysis vintage was significantly
   associated with the prevalence of valvular calcification.
   CONCLUSIONS Coronary artery calcification is common, severe and
   significantly associated with ischemic cardiovascular disease in adult
   ESRD patients. The dysregulation of mineral metabolism in ESRD may,
   influence vascular calcification risk. (C) 2002 by the American College

   and hyperthyroidism (IPTH greater than or equal to 200) in 13 of 48
   (27.1\%) subjects. The 20 patients with low IPTH had a higher prevalence
   of valvular heart disease, a higher total Ca level corrected for serum
   albumin (2.70 +/- 0.30 in low IPTH vs. 2.47 +/- 0.30 in normal iPTH,
   2.35 +/- 0.20 in high IPTH, p = 0.003) and a higher tendency of vitamin
   D-3 analog use (65\% in low IPTH vs. 33\% in normal IPTH and 46\% in
   high IPTH, p = 0.078). Moreover, corrected serum Ca exhibited a negative
   logarithmic correlation with serum iPTH: corrected Ca = -0.284 x log
   (IPTH) + 3.021 (r = 0.637, p = 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression
   analysis revealed diabetes and hypoparathyroidism (IPTH <60) as risk
   factors for cardiovascular complications in ESRD. Conclusion: These
   results suggest that hypercalcemia and hypoparathyroidism in conjunction
   with vitamin use D-3 might play an important role in cardiovascular
   complications of chronic dialysis patients. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger

Abstract = {{Background. Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has been detected with
   increased frequency in haemodialysis (HD) patients, making it necessary
   to determine the potential pathogenic factors in uraemic patients.
   Methods. A total of 92 chronic HD patients (39 female, 53 male) and 92
   age and gender-matched nondialysis control subjects were evaluated by
   echocardiography and a severity score for VC was determined.
   Calcium-phosphate metabolism was evaluated at the beginning of
   haemodialysis.
   Results. We found a greater prevalence of VC in dialysis patients than
   in normal patients (mitral annulus 44.5\% vs 10\%, P=0.02; aortic
   annulus 52\% vs 4.3\%, P=0.01). HD patients with mitral calcification
   were found to be older than patients without calcification, were on
   long-term renal replacement therapy, had longer duration of predialysis
   arterial hypertension, had greater values of the highest value of mean
   calcium-phosphate product in 6 successive months (CaxP) and the highest
   absolute value of calcium-phosphate product (CaxP,,,). We also found a
   positive correlation between calcification score, age, and CaxP. No
   correlation was found between actual VC and arterial hypertension or
   parathyroid hormone. Multiple stepwise regression analysis selected age
   and CaxP as the most predictive parameters for mitral calcification
   (r=0.47). Mitral calcification was associated more frequently with
   rhythm and cardiac conduction defects, valvular insufficiency and with
   peripheral vascular calcification. Aortic calcification was correlated
   with age (r=0.42) and longer duration of predialysis arterial
   hypertension.
   Conclusion. Our study confirmed an increased prevalence of VC in HD
   patients and selected age and calcium-phosphate product as the most
   predictive parameters. These findings support careful monitoring of
   calcium metabolism beginning at the early stages of end-stage renal
   failure to reduce the risk of heart disease.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether mitral valve or anulus calcification
   (MC) in patients with end-stage renal disease is associated with
   abnormalities of left ventricular (LV) structure and function, cardiac
   characteristics of 55 patients undergoing continuous ambulatory
   peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with (n = 26; age: 59 +/- 10 years) vs
   without (n = 29; age: 58 +/- 12 years) MC were analyzed using
   echocardiography and Doppler echocardiography. Sclerosis of the mitral
   valve anulus was detected in 18 (7 women, 11 men; age: 58 +/- 10 years)
   patients, sclerosis of mitral valve leaflets in 24 (13 women, 9 men;
   age: 59 +/- 10 years) patients. Patients with MC had higher systolic
   arterial blood pressure before initiation of dialysis therapy (191/104
   mm Hg vs 173/94 mm Hg; p < 0.05) and higher calcium-phosphorus products
   (55 +/- 13 vs 42 +/- 16; p < 0.05) during CAPD therapy than those
   without MC. Neither prevalence nor severity of MC was related to
   dialysis duration or patient age. Systolic LV function was reduced
   (ejection fraction: 58 +/- 12 percent vs 65 +/- 13 percent; p < 0.05)
   and LV end-diastolic diameters were dilated (54 +/- 5 vs 50 +/- 8 mm; p
   < 0.05) in patients with MC. Left atrial dilatation (73 percent vs 31
   percent; p < 0.005) and mitral valve regurgitation (65 percent vs 21
   percent; p < 0.001) were more frequent in patients with vs those without
   MC. Excluding patients with significant mitral regurgitation from pulsed
   Doppler analysis, diastolic LV function was comparably impaired in
   patients with vs those without MC (maximal early/atrial filling velocity
   ratio: 0.77 +/- 0.25 vs 0.75 +/- 0.22; atrial filling fraction: 47 +/-
   10 percent vs 48 +/- 11 percent; p = NS). The presented data suggest
   that MC follows long-standing and severe arterial hypertension before
   start of dialysis therapy. Therefore, effective blood pressure control
   in the predialysis period may be a tool to prevent these lesions. MC has
   clinical significance as a marker of LV dilatation and reduced LV
   systolic function in patients with chronic CAPD.}},
