N2  - Bone fractures are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of this study was to quantify the incidence of fractures in a cohort of prevalent HD patients and evaluate its relationship with possible risk factors. We performed a retrospective analysis of 341 patients, since they started HD (median of 51 months). Demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters as well as vascular calcifications (VC) were evaluated. Fifty-seven episodes of fracture were identified with a median HD vintage of 47 months (incidence rate of 31 per 1000 person-years). Age (p < 0.001), female gender (p < 0.001), lower albumin (p = 0.02), and higher VC score (p < 0.001) were independently associated with increased risk of fracture, while active vitamin D therapy (p = 0.03) was associated with decreased risk. A significantly higher risk of incident fracture was also associated with higher values of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) (p = 0.01) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels either < 300 pg/mL (p = 0.02) or > 800 pg/mL (p < 0.001) compared with 300-800 pg/mL. In conclusion, bone fracture incidence in HD patients is high and its risk increases with age, female gender, lower serum albumin, and with the presence of more VC. Prevalent HD patients with low or high iPTH levels or increased bALP also had a higher fracture risk. Therapy with active vitamin D seems to have a protective role. Assessment of fracture risk and management in dialysis patients at greatest risk requires further study.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in kidney and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients. Assessing abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), using lateral spine x-rays and the Kaupilla 24-point AAC (0-24) score, may identify transplant recipients at higher CV risk. Methods: Between the years 2000 and 2015, 413 kidney and 213 SPK first transplant recipients were scored for AAC at time of transplant and then followed for CV events (coronary heart, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease), graft-loss, and all-cause mortality. Results: The mean age was 44 ± 12 years (SD) with 275 (44%) having AAC (26% moderate: 1-7 and 18% high: ≥8). After a median of 65 months (IQR 29-107 months), 46 recipients experienced CV events, 59 died, and 80 suffered graft loss. For each point increase in AAC, the unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) for CV events and mortality were 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.15) and 1.11 (1.08-1.15). These were similar after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, transplant type, dialysis vintage, and diabetes: aHR 1.07 (95% CI 1.02-1.12) and 1.09 (1.04-1.13). For recipients with high versus no AAC, the unadjusted and fully-adjusted HRs for CV events were 5.90 (2.90-12.02) and 3.51 (1.54-8.00), for deaths 5.39 (3.00-9.68) and 3.38 (1.71-6.70), and for graft loss 1.30 (0.75-2.28) and 1.94 (1.04-3.27) in age and smoking history-adjusted analyses. Conclusion: Kidney and SPK transplant recipients with high AAC have 3-fold higher CV and mortality risk and poorer graft outcomes than recipients without AAC. AAC scoring may be useful in assessing and targeted risk-lowering strategies.

N2  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Calcifications of large arteries are frequent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may contribute to the high cardiovascular risk in this population. The aim of this study was to examine whether abdominal aortic calcification volume (AACV) was a predictor of the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4. METHODS: Eighty-four patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 were enrolled in this prospective observational study. At study entry, and annually, GFR was measured by plasma 51Cr-EDTA clearance. At baseline, haemodynamics was assessed and AACV was determined by computer tomography. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years and mean decline in GFR was -2.69 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year. At baseline, abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was detected in 66 patients (79%). A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that age was the only statistically significant independent predictor of AAC. In patients with AAC, male gender (B = 0.413, p = 0.030), aortic diastolic blood pressure (B = -0.025, p = 0.001) and ankle-brachial index (B = -1.666, p = 0.002) were independently associated with AACV using a multiple linear regression analysis. Neither the presence nor the extent of AAC was significantly associated with the rate of change in GFR during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4, only age was an independent predictor of the presence of AAC. AACV was not associated with the rate of decline in GFR.

N2  - Kidney stone disease is associated with cardiovascular outcomes; it is unclear whether stone composition is associated with differential cardiovascular risk. To analyze such association, we performed a cross-sectional study in which data were collected for patients who underwent at least one stone composition analysis from January 01 2015 to May 30 2018. The original dataset was linked with the imaging database to identify those patients with at least one abdominal CT scan examination during the period of interest. In total, 180 patients were included. The outcome of interest was the presence of any abdominal aortic calcifications (AAC) computed from CT scans. There were 108 (60.0%) patients with AAC. Calcium phosphate content was associated directly with eGFR, inversely with age, and was higher among females. Uric acid content was associated directly with age and inversely with eGFR, was higher among males, patients with diabetes and high blood pressure. After adjustment for age and gender, there was a significant association between calcium phosphate content and AAC (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00, 1.56, p = 0.045). No interaction by gender was found between calcium phosphate content and AAC (p = 0.84). In conclusion, we demonstrated a significant direct association of AAC and the amount of calcium phosphate was found, suggesting an increased cardiovascular risk. Our study suggests that some subtypes of kidney stone disease deserve a closer cardiovascular risk assessment.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Increased vascular stiffness is a risk factor for mortality. We wished to determine whether changes in vascular stiffness are associated with changes in bone mineral density (BMD) in peritoneal dialysis patients. METHODS: We measured vascular stiffness by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) and BMD by dual electron absorptiometry (DXA) scanning and compared T scores to compensate for differences in patient ages and gender. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had repeat aPWV measurements and DXA scans, median 12.4 months apart. aPWV decreased in 15 and increased in 9. As there were more women in the group with an increase in aPWV, we used gender-adjusted DXA T scores Total body T scores fell in both groups, but median T scores remained positive for those with an increase in aPWV, whereas negative T scores on both scans for those with a decrease in or stable aPWV. Lumbar spine T scores fell in those with a reduction in aPWV (-1.6 [-2.4 to 0.6] to -2.1 [-2.4 to 0.3], p < 0.05), whereas there was no significant decrease in those with an increase in aPWV (-0.5 [-1.1 to 0.15] to -0.7 [-1.7 to 0.6]). There were no changes in femoral neck T scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reinforces the hypothesis of a link between bone disease and vascular disease in dialysis patients. Lumbar spine DXA includes imaging of the aorta and will include aortic calcification, and as such a reduction in lumbar spine T score without a change in femoral neck T score suggests a reduction in aortic calcification. Although our study requires additional confirmation, our data would suggest that changes in aPWV could be used as a surrogate for changes in vascular calcification in the investigation of interventions designed to reduce vascular calcification.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in patients with end-stage renal disease, and osteoprotegerin (OPG) may be an important link between bone loss and vascular calcification. This study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between central arterial stiffness and serum OPG levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 120 HD patients, and the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) value was measured using a validated tonometry system. The cfPWV value of > 10 m/s was used to define the high artery stiffness group. Serum OPG levels were analyzed categorically into tertiles. Results: Of the 120 HD patients, 53 (44.2%) were defined as the high arterial stiffness group, who had higher values of systolic blood pressure (p = 0.038), serum calcium (p = 0.007), and OPG (p < 0.001) levels and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM, p = 0.001). Increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels were significantly associated with greater height (p = 0.011), male gender (p = 0.008), higher cfPWV values (p = 0.020), and lower intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH, p = 0.049) levels. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that cfPWV value was independently associated with DM (β = 1.83, p = 0.008) and increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (β = 0.89 and 1.63 for tertile 2 and tertile 3, respectively, p for trend = 0.035) in HD patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that, in addition to age, DM, low iPTH levels, and high serum calcium levels, increasing tertiles of serum OPG levels (OR = 5.34 for tertile 2; OR = 7.06 for tertile 3; p for trend = 0.002) were an independent predictor of high arterial stiffness in HD patients. Serum calcium levels positively correlated with cfPWV value only in the highest OPG tertile group (r = 0.408, p = 0.009). Conclusion: A positive association was detected between serum OPG levels and central arterial stiffness in HD patients, and patients with high serum OPG levels may have greater influence of calcium load on central arterial stiffening.

N2  - Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the GLA gene that lead to a reduction or an absence of the enzyme α-galactosidase A, resulting in the progressive and multisystemic accumulation of globotriaosylceramide. Clinical manifestation varies from mild to severe, depending on the phenotype. The main clinical manifestations are cutaneous (angiokeratomas), neurological (acroparesthesias), gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea abdominal pain), renal (proteinuria and kidney failure), cardiovascular (cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias), and cerebrovascular (stroke). A diagnosis of Fabry disease can be made with an enzymatic assay showing absent or reduced α-galactosidase A in male patients, while in heterozygous female patients, molecular genetic testing is needed. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human α-galactosidase is nowadays the most-used disease-specific therapeutic option. Despite ERT, cardiocerebrovascular-renal irreversible organ injury occurs, therefore additional knowledge and a deeper understanding of further pathophysiological mechanisms leading to end organ damage in Fabry disease are needed. Recent data point toward oxidative stress, oxidative stress signaling, and inflammation as some such mechanisms. In this short review, the current knowledge on the involvement of oxidative stress in cardiovascular-renal remodeling is summarized and related to the most recent evidence of oxidative stress activation in Fabry disease, and clearly points toward the involvement of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of the medium-to long-term cardiovascular-renal damage of Fabry disease.

N2  - Background/Aims: Aortic arch calcification (AoAC) is frequently detected in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients and is associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. We investigated the factors associated with AoAC and analyzed the relationship between the factors including bone-derived biomarkers and AoAC. Methods: We enrolled 389 stable MHD patients. AoAC was assessed using chest-X ray examination. Demographic data was collected in addition to serum levels of biochemical and bone-derived biomarkers, including sclerostin and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). Results: Two hundred sixteen patients (55.5%) had AoAC. Patients with AoAC score ≥ 4 were older, with a higher percentage being male, and exhibited lower serum levels of albumin and triglyceride. Serum FGF-23 levels were inversely associated with AoAC severity, and FGF-23was directly related to vascular calcification. Age, gender, and dialysis vintage were independent predictors of AoAC. Conclusion: MHD patients have a high prevalence of AoAC. The grade of AoAC was dependent on older age in association with longer dialysis vintage. Levels of circulating FGF-23 but not sclerostin were related to AoAC severity. Serum FGF-23 levels were independently associated with AoAC.

N2  - Aim: To assess changes in novel biochemical biomarkers, calciprotein particles following cessation of cinacalcet in dialysis patients. Background: The calcimimetic agent cinacalcet is effective for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients. Changes to reimbursement of cinacalcet in Australia provided an opportunity to assess effects of medication cessation on biochemical and clinical outcomes in dialysis patients, including changes to novel biomarkers such as calciprotein particles (CPP). CPP are nanoparticles of mineral and protein in the circulation associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with CKD. Methods: Dialysis patients from a single center who ceased cinacalcet between August 2015 and March 2016 were included in a prospective observational study. Blood tests were taken at time of cessation and at 1, 6 and 12 months. Clinical and biochemical outcomes were compared with an ageand gender-matched cohort of cinacalcet-naïve dialysis patients. Results: 62 patients participated in the study. Mean age was 69.6 ± 13.2 years. Biochemical changes over 12 months following cessation of cinacalcet included an increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) (42.2 [IQR 27.8-94.6] pmol/L to 114.8 [83.9-159.1] pmol/L [p<0.001]), serum calcium (2.31±0.21mmol/L to 2.46±0.14mmol/L [p<0.001]) and primary CPP (CPPI) (p=0.002). Changes in CPP were associated with an increase in PTH (p=0.007), calcium (p=0.002) and ferritin (p=0.02) but a reduction in serum albumin (p=0.001). Over the 12-month period, there were two fractures, five cardiovascular events, one episode of calciphylaxis, and one parathyroidectomy, with a mortality rate of 19% (n=13). Conclusion: Uniquely we report the effects of cinacalcet withdrawal in a real world setting with demonstrated increases in PTH, serum calcium and the novel prognostic marker CPP over a 12-month period.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), are mainly produced by endothelial cells, playing an important role in hemostasis, and may be useful biomarkers of endothelial cell (dys)function. Dyslipidemia, inflammation and high risk for cardiovascular events are common features in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Indeed, inflammatory cytokines are able to induce the synthesis of PAI-1 by endothelial cells. Our aim is to study the relationship between hemostatic disturbances, with inflammation, vascular calcification and lipid risk changes, in ESRD patients on hemodialysis treatment. METHODS: We studied 108 ESRD patients and 31 healthy individuals, matched for gender and body mass index, and, as far as possible, for age. We evaluated, by ELISA, PAI-1, t-PA and D-dimers as hemostatic markers; CRP and TNF-a as inflammatory markers; fetuin A as a vascular calcification marker; triglycerides and total cholesterol as lipid metabolism biomarkers. RESULTS: Compared to controls, ESRD patients presented significantly higher inflammatory markers; significantly lower values of t-PA, PAI-1 and significantly higher values of t-PA/PAI-1 ratio and D-dimers; fetuin A was significantly lower; TG were significantly higher and total cholesterol was significantly lower. CRP correlated positively and significantly with t-PA, PAI-1 and D-dimers; TNF-a and fetuin A presented a negatively significant correlation. CONCLUSIONS: The increased D-dimers, alongside with lower levels of t-PA and PAI-1 in ESRD patients suggest hyperfibrinolysis and an endothelial disturbance, which is corroborated by the observed decrease in fetuin A; moreover, the inflammatory condition seems to be correlated with these disturbances, and may contribute to enhance endothelial (dys)function and to increase the cardiovascular risk in ESRD patients on hemodialysis.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Myostatin which is a member of the transforming growth factor-b superfamily, regulates synthesis and degradation of skeletal muscle protein and it is up-regulated in the skeletal muscle of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. There are few studies on relationship between myostatin levels and vascular calcification (VC), important risk factors for cardiovascular disease in CKD. The aim of this study was to assess the association between serum myostatin levels and VC in patients with dialysis. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 71 outpatients undergoing dialysis were included. We checked several plain radiographs (hands and pelvis [HP], feet, and lateral lumbar spine) Serum myostatin levels were determined by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and divided by median for analysis. RESULTS: Our study included 37 hemodialysis patients and 34 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with a median age of 59.0 years and a median myostatin level of 4991.4 pg/mL. Patients with low myostatin levels were older and had a higher proportion of men and PD than those with high myostatin levels. The proportion of patients with AAC score ≥5 was significantly higher in patients with low myostatin levels than those with high myostatin levels, however, HP score ≥3 and the presence of feet calcification were no significantly different in both groups. The median myostatin level for patients with AAC scores≥5 was 4073.5 pg/mL, whereas that for AAC scores<5 was 5838.6 pg/ mL. Age and AAC scores showed a significantly negative correlation with myostatin levels. Lower myostatin levels were independently associated with higher AAC scores after adjustment for age, gender, DM, dialysis vintage, dialysis modality, and osteoprotegerin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Low serum myostatin levels were associated with elevated AAC scores in dialysis patients. Further studies are necessary to determine the significance of measuring serum myostatin level in patient with dialysis.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Fractures are animportant cause ofmorbidity and mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of this study was to quantify the incidence of bone fractures in a cohort of prevalent HD patients and evaluate its relationship with potential risk factors. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 341 prevalent HD patients since they started HD (median of 51 months). Demographic, clinical and biochemical parameters as well as vascular calcifications (VC) by Adragao score were evaluated. Results: Fifty-seven episodes of fracture were identified with a median HD vintage of 47 months, which corresponds to an incidence rate of 31 per 1000 person-years. In a multivariable analysis age (p<0.001), female gender (p<0.001), lower albumin (p=0.02) and a higher VC score (p<0.001) were independently associated with increased risk of fracture, while active vitamin D therapy (p=0.03) was associated with a decreased risk.A significantly higher risk of incident fracture was also associated with higher values of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bAP) (p=0.01) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels either< 300 pg/mL (p=0.02) or> 800 pg/mL (p<0.001) compared with 300-800 pg/mL. Conclusions: The incidence of bone fractures in HD patients is high and its risk increases with age, female gender, low serum albumin and with the presence of more VC. Prevalent HD patients with low or high iPTH levels or increased bAP also had a higher fracture risk. Unlike, therapy with active vitamin D seems to have a protective role. Assessment of fracture risk and management in dialysis patients at greatest risk requires further study.

While computed tomography is the gold standard for evaluation of vascular calcification, plain radiograph offers a simpler and less costly alternative. The calcification of abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral arteries has been evaluated by plain radiograph, but the data on their outcome predictabilities are still limited. The present study investigated the role of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) and pelvic arterial calcification (PAC) in predicting overall morality in non-dialysis CKD stages 2–5 (CKD 2–5), maintenance hemodialysis (HD) and long-term kidney transplant (KT) patients. Methods: Four hundred and nineteen patients were included. Lateral abdominal and pelvic radiographs were obtained. The degree of AAC and PAC was evaluated according to the methods described previously by Kaupplia et al. and Adragao et al. Patients were followed prospectively for 5 years. Results: AAC and PAC scores correlated well with the correlation coefficients of 0.442 for CKD 2–5, 0.438 for HD and 0.586 for KT (p < 0.001). Patients with AAC score > 6 or PAC score > 1 were older, showed higher prevalence of DM and had higher serum phosphate and PTH but lower serum albumin and eGFR. A more severe degree of AAC was associated with an increase in KT duration, whereas a more severe degree of PAC was associated with worsening kidney function and prolonged dialysis vintage. Kaplan–Meier survival curves revealed AAC score > 6 as a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in CKD 2–5 but not in HD or KT, whereas PAC score > 1 was a significant predictor of all-cause mortality in all three populations. After adjusting for age, the predictability of AAC was lost, whereas PAC remained an independent predictor of mortality in all three populations. Adjustments for cardiovascular and CKD risk factors including age, gender, BMI, DM, serum albumin, calcium and phosphate attenuated the predictability of PAC in HD but not in CKD 2–5 or KT patients. Conclusion: PAC was better than AAC in predicting mortality in CKD, HD and KT patients.

N2  - CALCIPHYLAXIS IS A RARE, LIFE-THREATENING SYNDROME OF VASCULAR calcification characterized by occlusion of microvessels in the subcutaneous adipose tissue and dermis that results in intensely painful, ischemic skin lesions. Once calciphylaxis has been diagnosed, the prognosis is generally poor (survival, <1 year).1-3 The disorder, which is underrecognized,4 typically affects patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD),2,5 a population with a high prevalence of extraskeletal calcifications. A clear majority of such calcifications do not represent calciphylaxis, which cannot be placed on a simple continuum of vascular calcification. However, an improved understanding of vascular calcification has helped to elucidate the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis and promising approaches to treatment. Calciphylaxis also occurs in patients with earlier stages of chronic kidney disease,2,5 acute kidney injury,6 or prior receipt of a kidney transplant,7 and in rare cases, it occurs in patients with normal kidney function.2,5,8,9 We therefore prefer the name calciphylaxis to calcific uremic arteriolopathy, which is another name for this entity.10 This review presents the current understanding of calciphylaxis and provides a framework for its interdisciplinary management.

N2  - Background: In 2002, the Committee for Standardized Reporting Practices in Vascular Surgery of the Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery proposed an anatomic severity grade score to categorize and to define anatomic factors as they relate to infrarenal abdominal aorta aneurysms (AAAs).1 The original purpose of this score was to quantitatively assess anatomic complexity of the aorta before undertaking a repair. Our group previously reported that aortic anatomic complexity is a marker of atherosclerotic risk and resource utilization at the time of repair.2,3 However, it remains unclear whether individual components to this scoredspecifically the aortic and iliac calcium burdend independently contribute to midterm survival after AAA repair. The purpose of this study was to analyze and to validate an aortic and iliac artery calcium scoring system that can predict midterm mortality after AAA repair. These data have direct implications for the population management-based treatment of aortic aneurysmal disease. Methods: Patients with complete 5-year records who underwent open and endovascular infrarenal AAA repairs between July 2007 and May 2012 at the University of Rochester Medical Center were retrospectively identified using Current Procedural Terminology (American Medical Association, Chicago, Ill) codes 34800, 34802, 34803, 34804, and 34805. To avoid potential interference from perioperative mortality, those who died within 30 days of surgery were not included. Degree of vessel calcification was obtained from preoperative computed tomography scans no more than 6 months before surgery, calculated manually using three-dimensional reconstruction software (Philips Intellispace Portal; Koninklijke Philips Electronic NV, Andover, Mass) by two blinded reviewers. Calcium score (CS) was defined using the anatomic severity grade scoring system for its basis.1 The scoring is as follows: For aortic neck calcium: d 0 points for <25% calcium d 1 point for 25% to 50% calcium d 2 points for $51% calcium For iliac calcium: d 0 points for no calcium d 1 point for <25% calcium d 2 points for 25% to 50% calcium d 3 points for $51% calcium A possible CS for any patient is between 0 and 5 points (the sum of the aortic and iliac calcium points). A receiver operating characteristic curve was developed to determine an appropriate CS threshold for analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves of the groups defined by this threshold were compared with log-rank and Wilcoxon signed rank tests, with statistical significance of P < .05. Patients who survived and those who did not were compared in regard to the following variables: CS, sex, race, age at time of surgery, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), presence of neoplasms, and specific pharmacologic therapies (beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, clopidogrel, and statins). The Pearson c2 test was used to compare categorical variables, and the Student t-test was used to compare continuous variables between the two groups. Each variable with a P value < .1 between the groups was then placed into a Cox proportional hazards model, with statistical significance of P < .05. All statistical analysis was performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Results: During our study period, 356 patients underwent AAA repair and had complete calcium and survival data who did not die within 30 days of AAA repair. Of 356 patients, 93 (26%) died within 5 years of AAA repair; 47 (13%) had CS of 0, with 7 (15%) deaths; 98 (28%) had CS of 1, with 21 (21%) deaths; 86 (24%) had CS of 2, with 21 (24%) deaths; 83 (23%) had CS of 3, with 29 (35%) deaths; 35 (10%) had CS of 4, with 14 (40%) deaths; and 6 (2%) had CS of 5, with 1 (17%) death. The developed receiver operating characteristic curve from these data demonstrated an appropriate threshold of CS of 3, with area under the curve of 0.61. There were 231 of 356 (65%) who had a CS <3, whereas 125 of 356 (35%) had a CS $3. These two populations were similar, except those with CS $3 had higher rates of COPD (31.2% vs 16%; P = .0008) and female gender (25.6% vs 16%; P = .0290). Fig demonstrates the 5-year Kaplan-Meier curves of these two groups, with a statistically significant greater 5-year mortality probability in patients with a CS $3 (35.2% vs 21.2%; log-rank, P = .0030; Wilcoxon, P = .0032). In comparing the 5-year mortality and survivor groups, chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs 6.8%; P = .0173), ESRD (3.2% vs 0%; P = .0034), COPD (30.1% vs 18.2%; P = .0164), beta blocker use (87.1% vs 78.7%; P = .0769), age (average of 77 vs 71 years; P < .0001), and CS $3 (47.3% vs 30.8%; P = .0041) had P < .1 and were appropriate to be used for a Cox proportional hazards analysis. Table demonstrates the results of this analysis. CS of $3 was associated with a statistically significant hazard ratio (HR) of 1.579 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.038-2.402; P = .0328). ESRD (HR, 9.013; 95% CI, 2.925-27.776; P = .0001), COPD (HR, 1.804; 95% CI, 1.138-2.860; P = .0121), and age (HR, 1.065; 95% CI, 1.037-1.093; P < .0001) were also associated with HR >1. Conclusions: The calcium scoring system presented herein is the first known system that validates a calcium scoring scheme that can signify increased midterm mortality after AAA repair. The degree of vessel calcification has been known to signify an overall burden of vascular disease, which has been examined in other specialties, including cardiology, and linked to mortality. In 2015, Shaw et al published a cohort study that demonstrated a coronary calcification score accurately predicting 15-year all-cause mortality in 9715 asymptomatic patients. Those with no score experienced a 3% mortality rate, whereas those with a score of 1000 or more experienced a 28% mortality rate.4 Our system potentially can be another measure to risk stratify patients undergoing AAA repair and serve as a means to predict midterm mortality probability. This study serves as a stepping stone in using this validated scoring system as a guide in decision-making in surgical intervention of AAAs at both the patient and population levels. These data have the potential to assist value-based decisions in a variety of vascular disease states. Limitations to this study include that it was retrospective in nature, covered only a particular population of AAA patients, did not include nonrepaired cases, and lacked data points at the extremes of CS (fewer (Figure presented) (Table presented) patients had a CS of 0 or 5) and that the means of calcium measurement were done manually, as automated software to do this does not yet exist. Future data will be needed to further validate this scoring system in predicting midterm mortality in patients undergoing AAA repair and to further develop the system in guiding decision-making in surgical repair of AAAs.

N2  - Vascular calcification and bone fragility are common and interrelated health problems that affect chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Bone fragility, which leads to higher risk of fracture and mortality, arises from the abnormal bone remodeling and mineralization that are seen in chronic kidney disease. Recently, sclerostin and Dickkopf-related protein 1 were suggested to play a significant role in CKD-related bone disease as they are known inhibitors of the Wnt pathway, thus preventing bone formation. This review focuses on new knowledge about the Wnt pathway in bone, how its function is affected by chronic kidney disease and how this affects bone structure. Expression of components and inhibitors of the Wnt pathway has been shown to be affected by the loss of kidney function, and a better understanding of the bone effects of Wnt pathway inhibitors could allow the development of new therapies to prevent bone fragility in this population.

N2  - Background: The strong correlation between vascular calcification and cardiovascular risk, which is a major cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients, has been well established. Fetuin-A is an inhibitor of vascular calcification, and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is produced at the site of inflammation, which is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The main purpose of this study was evaluating the correlation between fetuin-A and PTX3with some biochemical parameters effective upon vascular calcification in HD patients. Methods: We included 84 HD patients and 84 healthy controls matched for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) in this study. Blood samples were drawn from all subjects and the serum levels of creatinine, urea, albumin, calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), parathyroid hormone, fetuin-A, high sensitive C-reactive protein, and PTX3were measured by biochemical methods. Results: We found that the serum levels of PTX3, C-reactive protein (CRP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), Ca, and P in the patient group were significantly higher than the control group but the serum levels of fetuin-A and albumin were significantly lower in the patient group. Also, fetuin-A had a significant correlation with high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) as well as duration of dialysis. In addition, it was shown that the correlation between PTX3 and PTH was significant only in the patient group. Conclusion: In this study, increased PTX3 and decreased fetuin-A levels were observed in the HD patients. According to our results, these 2 parameters may potentially serve as suitable markers for inflammation and prediction of vascular complications in these patients.

N2  - Purpose: To systematically determine the prevalence of abdominal artery calcification (AAC) in dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and identify reasons for heterogeneity. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from database inception to March 2017. Cross-sectional or cohort (only used baseline data) studies reporting estimates of AAC prevalence in dialysis adult patients with ESRD were included. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to generate pooled prevalence estimates. Subgroup analyses were used to compare differences within categorical variables (geographic region, AAC detection instruments, dialysis methods, study design, and sample size), and meta-regression analyses to assess the impact of continuous variables (participants’ age, duration of dialysis, and male proportion). Results: A total of 44 studies with 9883 dialysis patients were included. The pooled prevalence for AAC was 68.5% (95% CI 63–73.9%). Subgroup analyses suggested that AAC prevalence varied significantly by geographical region and AAC detection instruments, not by dialysis methods, study design and sample size. Meta-regression analysis suggested that positive correlations were found between AAC prevalence and the age of participants as well as the male proportion (r = 1.01477, P = 0.002 and r = 2.034413, P = 0.01, respectively), but not with the duration of dialysis (P = 0.576). Conclusion: The pooled and nearest estimate of AAC prevalence among dialysis patients was as high as 65%. Geographical region, AAC detection instruments, age of participants, and male proportion potentially lead to the high variance of the reported prevalence. Considering the high AAC prevalence, effective treatment for preventing vascular calcification in these patients is badly needed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Circulating levels of factors that modulate vascular calcification (VC) play a role in determining individual susceptibility towards developing this complication. There have been conflicting reports regarding the association of Fetuin-A and VC. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of the study is to study the levels of FGF-23 and Fetuin-A; two factors that modulate VC; in pre-dialysis CKD 4-5 patients. METHODS: Out of a pre-existing cohort of 710 pre-dialysis patients with CKD Stage 4-5; patients with AAC (Group 1; cases; n= 26) were compared with an equal number of age; gender and eGFR matched patients without AAC (Group 2; disease controls; n = 26) and voluntary kidney donors (Group 3; n = 22) with respect to their demographic and biochemical parameters; including FGF-23 and Fetuin-A. AAC in cases and disease controls was assessed by lateral abdominal X ray; while Fetuin-A and intact FGF-23 were estimated by ELISA in serum. RESULTS: Groups 1 and 2 were not significantly different with respect to risk factors for AAC such as presence and duration of diabetes; hypertension; smoking and obesity. Levels of calcium; phosphorus; PTH; 25 (OH) vitamin D; serum cholesterol; triglycerides; HDL and LDL were also comparable between the two groups. As expected; median FGF-23 levels in Group 1> Group 2 > Group 3 (p< 0.001). In contrast; median Fetuin A levels in Group 3 > Group 1 > Group 2 (p = 0.006) despite CRP levels in Group 1 and 2 being similar (p = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: Pre-dialysis CKD may be a transition period during which Fetuin-A may be upregulated in response to VC; leading ultimately to a stage of Fetuin-A deficiency.

N2  - Background: Arterial stiffness is an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). There are limited prospective data however on progression of arterial stiffness in CKD, including evaluating associations with bone mineral markers such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and soluble α-klotho (sKl). Methods: In this prospective, single-center, observational study, arterial stiffness [measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV)] and hormones influencing mineral homeostasis, including serum FGF23 and sKl, were compared between non-dialysis CKD stages 4/5 and healthy controls at baseline and 12 months (12 m). Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was quantitated using lateral lumbar radiography at baseline. Results: Forty patients with CKD [mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 19.5 ± 6.7 mL/min/1.73m2] and 42 controls (mean eGFR 88.6 ± 12.9 mL/min/1.73m2) completed follow-up. There were no differences in age, gender and body mass index between groups. A significant increase in FGF23 [240.6 (141.9-1129.8) to 396.8 (160.3-997.7) pg/mL, p = 0.001] was observed in the CKD group but serum phosphate, corrected calcium, parathyroid hormone and sKl did not change significantly over 12 m. At baseline, CKD subjects had higher AAC prevalence [83.8% versus (vs.) 43.6%, p = 0.002] and higher aortic PWV [9.7(7.6-11.7) vs. 8.1 (7.2-9.7) m/s, p = 0.047] compared to controls. At 12 m, aortic PWV increased by 1.3 m/s (95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 2.08, p < 0.001) in the CKD cohort, with 30% of subjects showing progression from normal aortic elasticity to stiffening (PWV > 10 m/s). Serum FGF23 was associated with AAC, abnormal PWV and progression of PWV at 12 m. Conclusions: Arterial stiffness and serum FGF23, both of which are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, increased over one year in individuals with CKD. Additionally, a significant association was found between serum FGF23 and arterial calcification and stiffness. Larger clinical studies and further experimental work are warranted to delineate the temporal relationship as well as the pathological mechanisms linking FGF23 and vascular disease.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) may lead to low bone mineral density (BMD) and vascular calcification (VC), but links to the latter are unclear. Here we investigated associations between BMD, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, and histological signs of VC in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing living-donor kidney transplantation (LD-Rtx). In 66 ESRD patients (median age 45 years, 68% males), BMD (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, DXA), CAC score (by computed tomography, CT; n = 54), and degree of VC score (graded by histological examination of epigastric artery specimens collected at LD-Rtx; n = 55) were assessed at the time of LD-Rtx. Of the patients, 26% had osteopenia and 7% had osteoporosis. Of those undergoing artery biopsy, 16% had extensive VC, and of those undergoing CT 28% had high CAC score (>100 Agatston units). CAC scores correlated with BMD of legs and pelvis. BMDs of leg and pelvic sub-regions were significantly lower in patients with extensive VC. In multivariate regression analysis adjusted for age and gender, lower BMD of leg sub-region was associated with CAC score >100 AUs and extensive VC, and patients with extensive VC had significantly higher CAC score. Both high CAC and extensive VC were independently predicted by low BMD of legs. Low BMD has the potential to identify ESRD patients at risk of vascular calcification.

N2  - Introduction: Apabetalone is a first-in-class orally active bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) inhibitor associated with a reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) from phase 2 clinical trials. Apabetalone has previously been shown to downregulate markers of atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation, which may explain its effects on MACE. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a progressive loss of renal function and a high risk of CVD. Purpose: To determine the effect of apabetalone on levels of circulating proteins and pathways that contribute to cardiovascular complications in CKD, in a phase 1, open-label, parallel group study of patients with impaired kidney function. Methods: Eight subjects with stage 4 CKD not on dialysis (mean eGFR=20 ml/min/1.73m2) and eight age-, gender-, and BMI-matched subjects (mean eGFR=78.5 ml/min/1.73m2) received a single 100 mg oral dose of apabetalone. Plasma samples were collected at multiple time points over a period of 48 hours for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and at 12 hours post dose for proteomic analysis using the SOMAscan® 1.3K platform. Proteomics data were analysed with Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to identify pathways dysregulated in CKD patients compared to matched controls, and the effect of apabetalone treatment on those pathways. Results: Apabetalone PK parameters were similar in controls and CKD patients. At baseline, plasma proteomics showed enrichment of markers that correlate with progression of CKD, as compared to matched controls, including cystatin C and b2 microglobulin (3-fold and 5-fold enrichment, respectively, p<0.001). Accordingly, pathway analysis of CKD plasma proteome at baseline showed an upregulation of pathways that underlie CVD in CKD patients such as the inflammatory response, atherosclerosis, thrombosis and calcification, when compared to controls. These pathways were robustly and significantly downregulated in CKD patients by apabetalone 12h post dose. In the CKD group, apabetalone treatment also reduced the abundance of circulating CVD markers involved in vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis, fibrosis, vascular calcification, complement activation and hemostasis including CRP, IL-6, TNFα, IL-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, Lselectin, E-selectin, MMP-3, MMP-10, fibronectin, osteopontin, C3 and C5 active fragments, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, D-dimer and P-selectin (p<0.05). Conclusions: In stage 4 CKD patients, a single oral dose of apabetalone rapidly reduces circulating markers and molecular pathways linked to progression of renal disease and accompanying CVD complications. The potential impact of chronic treatment with apabetalone on biomarkers, renal function and CVD outcomes in patients with impaired kidney function is currently being studied in a subpopulation of the phase 3 BETonMACE CVD outcomes trial.

N2  - Purpose: Bone metabolism disorder is often associated with cardiovascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Sclerostin, a novel candidate protein, has been identified to be involved in the bone–vascular axis. The aims of the current investigation were to assess vessel sclerostin expression and its relationship with circulating sclerostin levels. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted from January 2012 to December 2014. Thirty-two predialysis patients with CKD stage 5 who received arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operations were enrolled in this study. Radial arteries were collected and paraffin-embedded during the AVF operation, followed by immunohistochemical staining for sclerostin expression. In addition, serum sclerostin levels were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The prevalence of positive sclerostin staining in the radial arteries was 56.25%. Sclerostin expression was localized in the artery media layer. Serum sclerostin levels in patients with positive sclerostin expression were much higher than in those with negative expression (p = 0.018). Multivariate logistic regression analyses including potential confounders as age, gender, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, serum sclerostin, corrected calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), Ca × P product, alkaline phosphatase, intact parathyroid hormone, and estimated glomerular filtration rate showed that only serum sclerostin levels were closely related to vessel sclerostin expression (p = 0.025). The area under the curve of serum sclerostin levels for predicting positive vessel sclerostin expression was 0.742 with 61.1% sensitivity and 85.7% specificity (p = 0.008). The cutoff point for vessel sclerostin expression of serum sclerostin was 1591.53 pg/mL. Conclusions: Positive expression of sclerostin in the radial artery media layer was related to high serum sclerostin levels. Sclerostin may act as both a local and systemic regulator involved in vascular calcification.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD5) show attributes characteristic of accelerated vascular aging, of which the most striking features are pronounced media vascular calcification (VC) and a 15-fold elevated risk for cardiovascular mortality compared to the general population. We tested the hypothesis that expression of klotho (KL) and sirtuin (SIRT) genes, previously linked to aging and degenerative processes, are associated with the degree of VC in CKD. METHODS: Gene expression of SIRT 1-7 and KL were analyzed with qPCR in epigastric arteries from 61 CKD5 patients undergoing living-donor renal transplantation. Control arteries without calcification were obtained from 7 non-renal patients undergoing hernia surgery or cholecystectomy. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained for phosphate content (von Kossa) and degree of media VC was scored by a pathologist (0; no VC, 1; mild VC, 2; moderate VC, 3; severe VC). Previous history of cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, and/or peripheral vascular disease (grouped as cardiovascular disease, CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) were retrieved from medical charts. RESULTS: CKD patients were slightly younger than non-renal controls (median age 45 [21-71] vs. 53 [44-67], p=0.03). SIRT4 was excluded from analysis due to undetectable expression levels in more than 50% of the samples. CKD patients showed higher arterial expression of SIRT3 (1.6x), SIRT5 (2.1x), SIRT6 (1.3x) and SIRT7 (3.1x) than controls (p<0.05 for all). None of the investigated genes were associated with DM (present in 10% of patients). KL (-3.3x), SIRT1 (-1.4x), SIRT2 (-2.4x), SIRT3 (-4.4x), SIRT5 (-2.3x), SIRT6 (-2.5x) and SIRT7 (-2.9x) expression were lower in patients diagnosed with CVD compared to CKD patients without CVD (p<0.05 for all). A graded decline in KL, SIRT1 and SIRT5 were found with higher calcification score (p<0.05 for all), also after correction for age and gender in multivariate analysis (p<0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: We report lower expression of KL, SIRT1 and SIRT5 in calcified uremic arteries. Down-regulation of the vascular klotho and sirtuin genes are indicative of elevated oxidative stress levels and may contribute to VC, while increased transcription of these genes could have therapeutic implications in treating vascular damage.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Apabetalone, an orally active bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitor, reduced incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with CVD and improved eGFR in a subpopulation with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in phase 2 trials. In CKD patients, vascular calcification (VC) increases CVD risk & is a predictor of all-cause mortality. The process of VC involves differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into osteoblast-like cells resulting in altered gene expression, loss of contractility & extracellular mineralization. Here we report clinical effects of apabetalone on circulating levels of factors involved in VC, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), an enzyme regulating pyrophosphate levels & contributing to calcium deposition. Circulating ALP is derived primarily from liver, & elevated ALP is associated with mortality in CKD or patients on dialysis. In vitro, cell systems demonstrate effects of apabetalone on expression of VC markers, differentiation of coronary artery VSMCs & pathological process of extracellular calcium deposition. METHODS: Effects of apabetalone on expression of osteogenic markers were investigated in primary human hepatocytes (PHH), human macrophages (U937), and primary human VSMCs. Extracellular calcium deposition induced by osteogenic culture conditions was measured in VSMCs. Proteomic assessment of plasma from a phase 1 trial in CKD patients receiving a single 100 mg oral dose of apabetalone was conducted using IngenuityVR Pathway Analysis. Proteins associated with VC were also assessed in plasma of CVD patients receiving apabetalone in 3 month (ASSERT) and 6 month (SUSTAIN & ASSURE) phase 2 trials. RESULTS: Factors involved in the process of VC are derived from multiple cell types. In PHH cells from multiple donors, ALP was downregulated 60-80% by apabetalone. Apabetalone also reduced expression of osteopontin, another established marker of VC, in PHH, VSMCs & U937 macrophages. Differentiation of primary VSMCs with osteogenic conditions induced expression of ALP, osteoprotegerin, RUNX2 & WNT5A, which was suppressed by apabetalone. Further, apabetalone dose dependently countered calcium deposition in VSMCs. Clinical trials support translational mechanisms investigated in vitro. Proteomic analysis of plasma from stage 4 CKD patients (n=8) demonstrated significant activation of pathways driving calcification including “BMP-2 signaling” and “RANK signaling in osteoclasts” versus age, gender & BMI matched individuals (n=8). Both pathways were downregulated by apabetalone 12 hours after a single dose. Apabetalone also significantly reduced circulating levels of proteins associated with VC in phase 2 trials in CVD patients, including ALP, osteopontin & osteoprotegerin. CONCLUSIONS: Apabetalone mediates reduction of factors & pathways associated with VC. Simultaneous effects on multiple contributing elements from a variety of cell types suggest apabetalone may decrease pathologic calcification in CKD & contribute to a reduction in MACE in patients with high CVD risk. The potential of apabetalone to reduce CVD in CKD patients is currently being explored in a subpopulation of the phase 3 BETonMACE cardiovascular outcomes trial in patients with established CVD and diabetes mellitus.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a progressive loss of renal function and a high risk of cardiovascular complications that lead to unfavorable outcomes in nearly half of patients. Apabetalone is a first-in-class orally active bromodomain and extraterminal domain inhibitor (BETi) associated with a reduction in major adverse cardiac events in phase 2 clinical trials in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, apabetalone was studied in a phase 1, open-label, parallel group study to examine single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) and levels of CKD markers in patients with impaired renal function. METHODS: Eight subjects with stage 4 CKD not on dialysis (mean eGFR=20 ml/min/ 1.73m2) and eight age-, gender-, and BMI-matched subjects (mean eGFR=78.5 ml/ min/1.73m2) received a single 100 mg oral dose of apabetalone. Plasma samples from participants were collected at multiple time points over a period of 48 hours for PK analysis and at 12 hours post dose for proteomic analysis using the SOMAscan® 1.3K platform. Proteomics data were analysed with Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to identify the top pathways dysregulated in CKD patients compared to healthy subjects, and the effect of apabetalone treatment on those pathways. RESULTS: PK parameters, including mean Cmax, AUClast, and t1=2, were similar in healthy subjects and CKD patients, with median tmax at 4h in both groups. At baseline, plasma proteomics showed enrichment of markers known to correlate with disease progression in CKD patients, as compared to matched controls, including cystatin C and b2 microglobulin (3-fold and 5-fold enrichment, respectively, p<0.001). Accordingly, pathway analysis of CKD plasma proteome at baseline confirmed an upregulation of pathways known to be activated in CKD such as the inflammatory response, immune response, thrombosis, calcification and oxidative stress, compared to controls. These pathways were robustly and highly significantly downregulated in CKD patients by apabetalone at 12h post dose. Apabetalone treatment also downregulated the abundance of circulating CKD biomarkers involved in vascular inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, acute phase response, coagulation and vascular calcification, including IL-6, TNFα, IL-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CRP, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and osteopontin (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In stage 4 CKD patients, a single oral dose of apabetalone rapidly reduces circulating markers and molecular pathways linked to progression of renal disease and accompanying CVD complications. The potential long term impact of apabetalone on biomarkers, renal function and CVD outcomes in patients with impaired kidney function is currently being studied in a subpopulation of the phase 3 BETonMACE CVD outcomes trial.

N2  - Purpose: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis. The impact of vascular calcification process on AVF survival remains unclear and results of several studies about this issue are controversial. In the light of the new knowledge about the different susceptibility for calcification process in different blood vessels, the aim of our study was to analyze whether the calcification of AVF-blood vessels may have an impact on AVF longevity. Methods: The study included 90 patients, 49 males and 41 females, all of them Caucasians, with a mean age 62 ± 11 years, on regular hemodialysis for more than 1 year with patent primary AVFs. Vascular calcification in AVF-blood vessels or in the anastomotic region was detected using X-ray examination. Results: Calcification in AVF-blood vessels was found in 62% of patients. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that male gender, presence of diabetes mellitus and longer duration of AVF before calcification determination were associated with calcification of AVF-blood vessels. Using a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for these standardized predicted values revealed that patients with present AVF-blood vessels calcification had increased risk to develop AVF failure with a hazard rate of 3.42 (95% confidence interval 1.00–11.67; P = 0.049). Conclusions: Calcifications of AVF-blood vessels are found frequently among dialysis patients and may jeopardize the survival of native AVF. We suggested the local X-ray as simple and valid method for detection of patients that are at risk for AVFs failure which should be monitored more closely.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) is common in type 2 diabetes, and is associated with cardiovascular complications. Recent preclinical data suggest that metformin inhibits VC both in vitro and in animal models. However, metformin's effects in patients with diabetic VC have not previously been characterized. The present study investigated the association between metformin use and lower-limb arterial calcification in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. Methods: The DIACART cross-sectional cohort study included 198 patients with type 2 diabetes but without severe chronic kidney disease. Below-the-knee calcification scores were assessed by computed tomography and supplemented by colour duplex ultrasonography. Data on anti-diabetic drugs were carefully collected from the patients' medical records and during patient interviews. Biochemical and clinical data were studied as potential confounding factors. Results: Metformin-treated patients had a significantly lower calcification score than metformin-free patients (mean ± standard deviation: 2033 ± 4514 and 4684 ± 9291, respectively; p = 0.01). A univariate analysis showed that metformin was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of severe below-the-knee arterial calcification (p = 0.02). VC was not significantly associated with the use of other antidiabetic drugs, including sulfonylureas, insulin, gliptin, and glucagon like peptide-1 analogues. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the association between metformin use and calcification score (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.33 [0.11-0.98]; p = 0.045) was independent of age, gender, tobacco use, renal function, previous cardiovascular disease, diabetes duration, neuropathy, retinopathy, HbA1c levels, and inflammation. Conclusions: In patients with type 2 diabetes, metformin use was independently associated with a lower below-the-knee arterial calcification score. This association may contribute to metformin's well-known vascular protective effect. Further prospective investigations of metformin's potential ability to inhibit VC in patients with and without type 2 diabetes are now needed to confirm these results.

N2  - Background: In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery calcification (CAC) and inflammation contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins do not improve survival in patients with ESRD, and their effect on vascular calcification is unclear. We explored associations between CAC, inflammatory biomarkers, statins and mortality in ESRD. Materials and methods: In 240 patients with ESRD (63% males; median age 56 years) from cohorts including 86 recipients of living donor kidney transplant (LD-Rtx), 96 incident dialysis patients and 58 prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients, associations of CAC score (Agatston Units, AUs), interleukin-6 (IL-6) with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), use of statins and all-cause mortality were analysed. Cardiac CT was repeated in 35 patients after 1·5 years of renal replacement therapy. In vitro, human vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs) were used to measure vitamin K metabolism. Results: Among 240 patients, 129 (53%) had a CAC score > 100 AUs. Multivariate analysis revealed that independent predictors of 1-SD higher CAC score were age, male gender, diabetes and use of statins. The association between CAC score and mortality remained significant after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, use of statins, protein-energy wasting and inflammation. Repeated CAC imaging in 35 patients showed that statin therapy was associated with greater progression of CAC. In vitro synthesis of menaquinone-4 by hVSMCs was significantly impaired by statins. Conclusion: Elevated CAC score is a mortality risk factor in ESRD independent of inflammation. Future studies should resolve if statins promote vascular calcification and inhibition of vitamin K synthesis in the uremic milieu.

N2  - Background: Arterial calcifications are commonly found among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), especially in diabetics, and have been proposed as one of the risk factors for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) loss. The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of arterial calcification in upper extremities among patients aged ≥65 years using preoperative duplex ultrasound (US) imaging and to evaluate the impact of calcification on AVF outcomes. Materials and methods: Retrospective study was performed with data prospectively collected between January 1, 2005, and September 1, 2011. Before the first attempt of AVF creation, preoperative duplex US imaging of vessels of both arms and forearms was performed. Arterial calcifications were described as present (high echo intensity region with acoustic shadow) or absent. Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the effect of calcifications and other factors considered relevant to the AVF loss (gender, diabetes status, age - stratified as 65-75 or ≥75 years, start of hemodialysis, atherosclerotic changes). AVFs were constructed by one dedicated interventional nephrologist. Results: 214 incident patients with ESRD (aged 75.5 ± 6.0 years), 58% males, and 41.6% diabetics participated in the study. Cubital and radial artery calcifications were detected in 33.1% and 41.8% of patients, respectively. As compared to patients without calcification, those with calcifications were more likely to have diabetes (cubital 41.8% vs 26.0%, p = 0.028;r adial 51.3% vs 35.2%, p = 0.029). In 159 patients native AVF was placed. Median followup was 21 months (IQR, 11 to 36 months). Calcifications were not associated with primary (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.53; p = 0.70) or secondary patency loss (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.39o t1.43; p = 0.38). Conclusions: Based on preoperative duplex US imaging, arterial calcifications in upper extremities are found in less than half of patients with ESRD aged ≥65 years and do not seemo t predict AVF patency loss.

N2  - Objective Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a major complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduced bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with vascular calcification. Here we investigated associations between vertebral bone density (VBD) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), quantified by cardiac computed tomography (CT), and BMD quantified by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and their relations with mortality. Methods In 231 ESRD patients (median age 56 years, 63% males) comprising incident dialysis patients, prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients and recipients of living donor kidney transplant, VBD (Hounsfield units, HUs) and CAC scores (Agatston units, AUs) were quantified by cardiac CT, and, in 143 of the patients, BMD was measured by DXA of total body. Metabolic and inflammation biomarkers potentially linked to CKD-MBD were also analysed. Results Patients with low tertile of VBD were older and had more often cardiovascular disease (CVD), and higher HbA1c (non-diabetics), interleukin-6 and CAC score. Low VBD was independently associated with higher CAC score (> 100 AUs) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and cohorts. In Cox proportional hazards analysis, low VBD was independently associated with all-cause mortality after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, CVD, inflammation and subjective global assessment (SGA). The root mean-squared error of prediction (RMSE) showed a good degree of association between VBD and BMD evaluated from DXA. In receiver-operator characteristics curve (ROC) analysis, lower VBD was more strongly associated with higher CAC score and all-cause mortality than BMD evaluated from DXA. Conclusions While assessments of BMD by DXA and CT showed good degree of agreement, associations of high CAC, and mortality, with low VBD were stronger than those based on low BMD by DXA. The strong independent associations of low VBD with high CAC score and increased mortality risk suggest that VBD may serve as an important prognosticator in ESRD patients.

N2  - Objective: Early vascular aging (EVA) is a feature of chronic kidney disease(CKD) and pulse wave velocity(PWV) is independent predictor of premature cardiovascular(CV) mortality.High blood pressure(BP) and vascular calcifications contribute mostly to EVA in this group.Endemic nephropathy(EN), an environmental form of aristolochic acid nephropathy, is a chronic tubulointerstitial salt wasting nephropathy characterized with later onset and milder forms of hypertension (HT), and in line with this we hypothesized that arterial stiffness progresses slowlier in EN pts resulting in lower CV mortality. Design and method: A total of 186 hemodialysed(HD) patients (90m, 96w; 67.35+13.07 years) were enrolled. At the end of follow up, after 25 months, 97 pts were alive (52EN and 45non-EN).All patients were dialysed by the international guidelines. Brachial BP was measured with Omron M6 device and PWV was determined by Arteriograph before mid-week dialysis. Results: There were no differences in gender, smoking status, type of vascular access, phosphate binder doses, vitamin D and dialysis modalities between two groups.At baseline and at the start of HD EN pts were significantly older (72. ± 37.1 vs 62.8 ± 15.1; p < 0.001), had shorter duration of HT prior commencement of HD than non-EN pts (36 vs. 84 months; p < 0.001). There were no differences in BP, but EN pts were treated with less antihypertensive drugs (p < 0.01).EN pts had lower values of P and CaxP (all p < 0.001) and significantly lower PWV values at baseline and at the end of follow-up period (9.2 ± 1.6 vs. 10.5 ± 1.9; 9.3 ± 1.3 vs. 10.5 ± 1.9, respectively; both p < 0.001). In multivariate analyses EN was independent predictor of high PWV. During the study period EN patients died significantly less frequently from CV events (12% vs. 32%; p = 0.001), and had longer mean survival time (22.3 vs. 18.2 months, p < 0.001). CV mortality was significantly lower in EN group (15.0% vs. 37.8%, HR 0.32 [0.18, 0.59], log-rank p = 0.0004), which remained significant after adjustment for other risk factors (aHR0.17[0.06, 0.49]). Baseline PWV > 10m/s was associated with higher risk for CV mortality(aHR 1.88[1.42, 2.49]). Conclusions: Despite being older EN patients had lower PWV values.In EN, later onset of HT during predialytic clinical course, milder form of HT and better control of phosphate during HD therapy slowdown vascular aging and thus CKD progression, and importantly resulting in lower CV mortality and longer survival time. Opposite to EVA in other CKD, EN might be the case of slower vascular aging.

N2  - Background/Aims: Vascular calcifications (VCs) and fractures are major complications of chronic kidney disease. Hemodialysis patients have a high prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and an increased risk of thromboembolism, which should be prevented with warfarin, a drug potentially causing increased risk of VCs and fractures. Aim of this study is evaluating, in hemodialysis patients with and without AF, the prevalence of VCs and fractures, as well as identifying the associated risk factors. Methods: A total of 314 hemodialysis patients were recruited, 101 with documented AF and 213 without AF. Comorbidities, chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder blood tests and therapies were collected. Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for the detection of fractures, defined as vertebral body reduction by ≥20 %. In the same radiograph, the length of aortic calcification was also measured. Logistic regression models were applied for evaluating the independent predictors of presence of VCs and vertebral fractures. Results: In our population VCs were very common (>85 %). Severe VCs (>10 cm) were more common in patients with AF (76 %) than in patients without (33 %). Vertebral fractures were present in 54 % of patients. Multivariable analysis showed that AF (OR 5.41, 95 % CI 2.30–12.73) and 25(OH) vitamin D <20 ng/mL (OR 2.05, 95 % CI 1.10–3.83) were independent predictors of VCs. Age (OR 1.04/year, 95 % CI 1.01–1.07) and male gender (OR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.07–2.90) predicted vertebral fractures. Conclusions: Hemodialysis patients had an elevated prevalence of severe VCs, especially when affected by AF. Low vitamin D levels were strongly associated with severe VCs. Prevalence of vertebral fractures was also remarkably high and associated with older age and male gender.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Cardiovascular calcification is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. Few data are available to show whether different dialysis patterns, hemodialysis (HD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis(PD), would influence the development of vascular calcification. The aim of this study was to compare vascular calcification scores between patients on maintenance HD and PD, and to identify risk factors of vascular calcification in those patients. Methods: There were 92 patients on maintenance HD and 92 patients on PD, with matched age, gender and diabetes ratio, recruitted from our dialysis center. Clinical data were collected and vascular calcification scores were detected using plain radiographs of abdominal aorta, iliac and femoral artery, digital and radial artery vascular calcification, respectively. Pelvis films were divided into four sections by a horizontal line over the upper limit of both femoral heads and a vertical line over the vertebral column. Hands films were divided into four sections by a horizontal line over the upper limit of the metacarpals. Abdominal films was divided into two sections by the horizontal line over the L2/L3 intervertebral disc. The presence of vascular calcification in each section was scored as 1 and no calcification as 0. The total score was the sum of all sections ranging from 0 to 10. All X-rays were read by two investigators independently. T-test or rank test were performed to compare the different between the data of two groups. Results: No significant difference of total vascular calcification scores was identified between the two groups (HD 2.59±2.88 vs PD 3.35±3.13, P=0.088), while the abdominal aorta calcification scores were significantly higher in PD patients as compared with HD patients (HD 0.96±0.87vs PD 1.38±0.84, P=0.001). After controlling variables, vascular calcification score of HD patients was positively correlated with age (r=0.228 P=0.031) , serum phosphorus levels (r=0.263 P=0.012), and was negatively correlated with serum HDL levels (r=-0.207 P=0.048). While inPD patients, the vascular calcification score was positively correlated with age(r=0.411, P=0.000), and negatively correlated with serum albumin (r=-0.249, P=0.018) and Kt/v (r=-0.313, P=0.002). Conclusions: Our cross-sectional study suggests that abdominal aorta calcification were severer in patients on maintenance PD when compared with HD, which may explain the different morbidity and mortality between PD and HD patients as reported previously. The underlining mechanisms warrant further investigation. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification, which is caused by Wnt pathway, is related to cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. A sclerostin is known to be an endogenous antagonist of bone calcification with Wnt pathway. However, its roles and meanings in vascular calcification are unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that increased plasma sclerostin is related with coronary arterial calcification score (CCS) in dialysis patients. Methods: Sclerostin, hsCRP, lipid levels, calcium, phosphate, and iPTH levels were measured in the fasting plasma samples from 20 hemodialysis and 20 peritoneal dialysis patients, and 20 healthy and- and gender-matched controls. CCSs were measured by the coronary computed tomography angiogram. Cardiovascular risk was assumed by CCS (0; non-identified, 1∼10; minimal, 1∼100; mild, 101∼400; moderate, >;400; high). Results: Plasma sclerostin concentrations in the hemodialysis (6.06 ± 3.10 ng/mL) and peritoneal dialysis (5.28 ± 3.20 ng/mL) groups were significantly higher than that in the control group (0.91 ± 0.19 ng/mL). CCS in the hemodialysis (1112.2 ± 385.6) was significantly higher than those in the peritoneal dialysis (414.9 ± 129.4) and control group (5.98 ± 4.04). Both sclerostin and CCS were increased according to the dialysis vintage (r = 0.759 and r = 0.662, p < 0.001). The level of plasma sclerostin was related to CCS (r = 0.657, p < 0.001) even controlling for age, sex, dialysis vintage and levels of blood sugar, phosphate, calcium. Conclusions: In our cohort of dialysis patients, higher level of sclerostin showed higher burden of coronary calcification and therefore sclerostin might be a candidate biomarker for cardiovascular risk assessment in dialysis patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Hyperphosphatemia, lack of calcitriol and hypocalcemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to hyperplasia in parathyroid tissue and eventually formation of an autonomous secreting gland, and even formation of an adenoma, in time. Thus, the clinicians are faced with hyperparathyroidism resistant to conventional therapy. Uncontrolled PTH leads to intractable elevated calcium and phosphorus levels, vascular calcification, increased cardiovascular mortality, decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of fracture. In our study, we aimed to compare effectiveness of parathyroidectomy and calcimimetic treatment in patients who diagnosed with resistant hyperparathyroidism. Methods: In our retrospective cohort study, we included 2 groups comprising of 15 (M/F: 7/8) patients who were resistant to traditional treatment and 31 (M/F: 21/10) patients who underwent parathyroidectomy. Ca, P, CaXP product, iPTH (intact parathormone) and T and Z scores of BMD (bone mineral densitometer) were compared in both groups before treatment and in 6th and 12th months after treatment. Results: There were no significant difference between two groups in terms of age, gender, period of dialysis, degree of DM. Moreover, there were no statistical difference between initial BMD T and Z scores, levels of Ca, P, iPTH. When Ca, P and ALP levels were compared at 6th months of treatment, no significant difference was observed between the two groups (p=0.078, p=0.123, p = 0.082, respectively). In those underwent parathyroidectomy there was a significant difference between PTH and CaXP product ( p<0.00, p=0.034, respectively). When Ca, P and T and Z scores (p=0.054, p=0.187, p=0.279, p=442 respectively) of both groups at 12th months of treatment were compared no significant difference was observed. However, iPTH, ALP and CaXP product were significantly different ( p<0.001, p=0.006, p=0.048). Conclusions: In conclusion, it was found that two groups had similar effect on the levels of Ca and P alone; however, it seems to be parathyroidectomy was superior to the treatment with calcimimetics in permenantly controlling CaXP product and iPTH in treating hyperparathyroidism which is resistant to traditional treatment.

N2  - Background and objectives: The relationship between mineral metabolism disorders, bone fractures and vascular calcifications in kidney transplant recipients has not been established. Method: We performed a cross-sectional study in 727 stable recipients from 28 Spanish transplant clinics. Mineral metabolism parameters, the semi-quantification of vertebral fractures and abdominal aortic calcifications were determined centrally. Results: Vitamin D deficiency (25OHD3 <15 ng/ml) was more common in female recipients at CKD-T stages I-III (29.6% vs 44.4%; p = 0.003). The inverse and significant correlation between 25OHD3 and PTH was gender-specific and women exhibited a steeper slope than men (p = 0.01). Vertebral fractures (VFx) with deformity grade ≥2 were observed in 15% of recipients. Factors related to VFx differed by gender; in males, age (OR 1.04; 95% CI 1.01-1.06) and CsA treatment (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 1.6-6.3); in females, age (OR 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03-1.12) and PTH levels (OR per 100 pg/ml increase: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.043-1.542). Abdominal aortic calcifications were common (67.2%) and related to classical risk factors but not to mineral metabolism parameters. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is more common among female kidney transplant recipients at earlier CKD-T stages, and it contributes to secondary hyperparathyroidism. Prevalent vertebral fractures are only related to high serum PTH levels in female recipients.

N2  - Context: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest that activated Wnt signaling contributes to VC. Objective: The objective was to investigate whether circulating levels of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with progression of VC. Design: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal observational Brussels Renal Transplant Cohort study. Setting: The setting was a tertiary care academic hospital. Patients: Coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification were measured by multislice spiral computerized tomography in 268 prevalent RTRs (age, 53 ± 13 y; 61% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189 patients after a median follow-up of 4.4 years. Baseline serum sclerostin levels were assessed on stored blood samples. Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of baseline VC and progression. Main outcome measure: The main outcome measure was progression of VC. Results:VCwas present in up to84%of participants at baseline. Almost half of the patients showed progression of VC, according to Hokanson criteria. The cross-sectional analysis at baseline demonstrated a direct association between sclerostin levels and VC score in univariate analysis, which became inverse after adjustment for age, gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level was identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline aorta calcification score in the final regression model. Moreover, baseline sclerostin levels showed an inverse association with VC progression, at least after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Conclusions: Serum sclerostin levels inversely associated with VC burden and progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Our data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted chronic kidney disease patients and support the notion that sclerostin may be up-regulated in the vascular wall during the VC process as part of a local counterregulatory mechanism directed to suppress VC. Additional clinical and experimental data are required for confirmation.

N2  - Calcific uremic arteriolopathy, also known as calciphylaxis, is a rare syndrome of small vessel calcification of unknown etiology causing painful, violaceous skin lesions that progress to form chronic non-healing ulcers and gangrene. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can be used as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of these ulcers. However, due to paucity of cases, there is limited data on the clinical benefit of HBOT and identifying factors associated with healing. The purpose of this study was to determine patient outcomes and factors associated with healing in patients with calciphylaxis undergoing HBOT. A retrospective chart review was completed on patients who were diagnosed with calciphylaxis and had hyperbaric medicine consultation between May 2012 and January 2016. Clinical outcomes, demographics, risk factors, laboratory values, wound distribution, and HBOT profiles were collected and analyzed. We identified 8 patients. Out of 8 patients consulted for calciphylaxis, five were consented and underwent HBOT (2 males and 3 females). All had coexisting ESRD and Diabetes. All males were able to tolerate being in the chamber and received therapeutic treatments (at least 20 HBOT) with complete resolution of ulcers. HBOT was discontinued in one female due to an inconsistent biopsy report and two others due to death secondary to septic shock or respiratory arrest and severe uremia. Calciphylaxis is a devastating disease with a high mortality rate. Our results demonstrated a positive response to HBOT especially when receiving at least 20 treatments. A majority of calciphylaxis cases are females and indeed female gender has been cited as a risk factor for this disease. However, current literature has not conferred a relationship between gender nor the number of HBOT received and outcomes. Our results showed that males had a more favorable outcome provided they received at least twenty HBOT. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate these outcomes.

N2  - The presence of bone tissue in calcified arteries may provide insights into the pathophysiology and potential reversibility of calcification, but the prevalence, distribution, and determinants of bone and osteoclasts in calcified arteries are unknown. Specimens of 386 arteries from lower limb amputations in 108 patients were examined retrospectively. Calcification was present in 282 arteries from 89 patients, which was medial in 64%, intimal in 9%, and both in 27%. Bone was present in 6% of arteries, essentially all of which were heavily calcified. Multiple sampling revealed that the true prevalence of bone in heavily calcified arteries was 25%. Bone was more common in medial rather than intimal calcifications (10% vs 3%, p=0.03) but did not vary with artery location (above vs below the knee). Heavily calcified arteries with bone were more likely to come from patients who were older (p=0.04), had diabetes (p=0.06), or were receiving warfarin (p=0.06), but there was no association with gender or renal failure. Bone was almost always adjacent to calcifications, along the periphery, but never within. Staining for the bone-specific proteins osteocalcin and osterix was noted in 20% and 45% of heavily calcified arteries without visible bone. Osteoclasts were present in 4.9% of arteries, all of which were heavily calcified and most of which contained bone. The frequent absence of bone in heavily calcified vessels and the histologic pattern strongly suggests a secondary rather than primary event. Recruitment of osteoclasts to vascular calcifications can occur but is rare, suggesting a limited capacity to reverse calcifications.

N2  - Purpose: To evaluate whether fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) has a common role in the pathogenesis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Material and Method: Twenty-one patients with diabetic nephropathy composed the diabetic nephropathy (DM-NP) group and 20 subjects with DM but without NP constituted the DM group. The control group was comprised of 10 age- and gender-matched non-diabetic individuals with CKD. Results: FGF-23 levels were similar in DM-NP and CKD groups (p=0.5). Both groups had higher FGF-23 levels compared to DM group (p<0.001 and p=0.007). PAD was more common in DM than in CKD (p=0.03). In all cases involving DM (e.g., both the DM-NP and DM-groups), FGF-23 levels did not vary with arterial wall changes recorded via Doppler ultrasonography (p=0.5). Discussion: NP and PAD may be independent complications of DM. In DM, FGF-23 may be a marker of NP but not of PAD.

N2  - Aim: Vascular access (VA) dysfunction limits hemodialysis delivery, which increases morbidity and mortality. The most com mon cause of VA failure is thrombosis, due to flow limiting stenosis resulting from neointimal hyperplasia. This occurs not only due to hemodynamic factors but also by systemic ones related to vascular atherosclerosis, inflammation and calcification, which has developed a simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) predictor of vascular calcification and arterial stiffness. The NKF-K/DOQ recommends several diagnostic procedures for VA surveillance. Blood access flow (Qa) has predictive power for the detection of stenosis. Our aim was to evaluate the role of systemic factors, especially SCVS, on Qa. Material and methods: Transversal study in 50 patients. Qa value was obtained with Blood Temperature Monitor and Doppler method. Pearson coefficient evaluated correlation between them. Clinical, lab and radiological variables were recorded and non-parametric tests evaluated how both Qa varied with them. Results: Pearsons corelation between DU-Qa and TD-Qa was 0.851 (p-value <0.001). DU-Qa varied significantly with age (p = 0.012), VA type (p = 0.021), SCVS (p = 0.030), intra-access arterial pressure (p = 0.015) and time on dialysis (p = 0.002). BTM-Qa varied significantly with diabetes status (p = 0.027), age (p = 0.017), first VA status (p = 0.036), intra-access arterial pressure (p = 0.028) and dialysis time (p = 0.001). Nevertheless, gender, hypertensive status and analitical parameters did not change the flow values. Conclusion: Higher SVCS was associated only with lower DU-Qas, giving this method an advantage towards the indirect one. Additionally, a simple method like SVCS may be used to guide new surveillance recommendations accordingly to risk stratification.

N2  - The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with vascular calcification in patients treated with hemodialysis. Methods: As a cross-sectional study, 126 patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) in our hospital were enrolled in this study. According to the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, the patients were divided into 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency group (30 ηg/ml or less than 30 ηg/ml) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D normal level group (>30 ηg/ml). All of the subjects underwent lateral lumbar, pelvis and hands X-ray examination to score the degree of calcification (Kauppila score). Results: Among the 126 patients treated with MHD, there were 110 patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and 16 patients with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. There was no significant difference found in gender, age, age of dialysis, active vitamin D treatment, blood calcium, blood phosphorus, blood parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other related indicators between the two groups. The incidence of vascular calcification in patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was significantly higher than that in patients with normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (P = 0.001). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level had a negative correlation with the calcification score (r = 0.193, P = 0.193). Logistic regression showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not a risk factor for vascular calcification in MHD patients. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is generally low in patients with MHD. Conclusions: Patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency have a higher incidence of vascular calcification with a markedly negative correlation. Thus, for the patients treated with MHD, vitamin D deficiency should be actively treated.

N2  - Background: Observational data suggest that serum magnesium (Mg) concentration is inversely related to vascular calcification and hyperparathyroidism among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In recent years, there have been several case reports of hypomagnesemia due to use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPI), with the hypomagnesemia attributed to inappropriate gastrointestinal (GI) Mg loss. We hypothesized that the tendency to GI Mg loss is more common than is currently reported. Since patients with ESRD have little to no renal Mg loss to affect serum Mg concentration, dialysis patients are an interesting population in whom to study the relationship between PPI use and serum Mg levels. Methods: Using a single-center cross-sectional design, we studied 155 prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum Mg concentration for each patient was determined based on the mean of 3 consecutive serum Mg levels drawn at 6 week intervals. PPI use at the time of the blood tests was documented. The relationship between PPI use and Mg concentration was determined in unadjusted analyses, as well as after adjustment for age, gender, race, cause of ESRD, diabetes, time on HD and dialysate Mg concentration. Results: 55 % of patients were on PPIs at the time of the study. The majority of patients (62 %) used a dialysate Mg (in mmol/L) of 0.5, and the remainder (38 %) used a dialysate Mg of 0.375. Serum Mg levels were significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users (0.93 vs. 1.02 mmol/L, p < 0.001). This finding persisted after stratifying for dialysate Mg concentration, and after multivariable adjustment (p < 0.001). In addition, more PPI users vs. non-users had a Mg level < 1 mmol/L (79 % vs. 43 %) and a Mg level < 0.8 mmol/L (16 % vs. 4 %). There was a non-significant trend toward increased time on PPI being associated with lower serum Mg levels (p = 0.067). Conclusion: Among HD patients, PPI users have lower serum Mg levels as compared with non-users. Further research is required to determine whether the magnitude of change in Mg levels among PPI users is associated with adverse outcomes.

N2  - BackgroundOsteoprotegerin (OPG), sclerostin and DKK1 constitute opposite bone turnover inhibitors, OPG inhibiting osteoclastogenesis while sclerostin and DKK1 exerting their inhibitory effects on osteoblastogenesis. Both proteins have been recognized as strong risk factors of vascular calcifications in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between these inhibitors and coronary artery calcifications (CAC) in this population. MethodsA total of 241 ND-CKD patients [143 males; 69.0 (25.0-95.0) years; median estimated glomerular filtration rate using CKD-EPI 35.1 (6.7-120.1) mL/min/1.73 m2] were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. All underwent chest multidetector computed tomography for CAC scoring. OPG, sclerostin, DKK1 and mineral metabolism markers including PTH and bone alkaline phosphatase were measured. Logistic regression analyses were used to study the relationships between CAC and these markers. ResultsDecline in renal function was associated with a significant increase in OPG and sclerostin while a slight but significant decrease in DKK1 was observed. The main crude associations with presence of CAC were a high level of OPG [OR = 2.55 95% confidence interval (95% CI) (1.35-4.82) for a level ranging from 6.26 to 9.15 pmol/L and OR = 5.74 95% CI (2.87-11.5) for a level ≥9.15 pmol/L; P < 0.0001] and a high level of sclerostin [OR = 2.64 95% CI (1.39-5.00) for a level ranging from 0.748 to 1.139 ng/mL and OR = 3.78 95% CI (1.96-7.31) for a level ≥1.139 ng/mL; P = 0.0002]. A logistic regression model clearly showed that the risk to present CAC was significantly increased when both OPG (≥6.26 pmol/L) and sclerostin (≥0.748 ng/mL) levels were high [crude model: OR = 11.47 95% CI (4.54-29.0); P < 0.0001; model adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, body mass index and smoking habits: OR = 5.69 95% CI (1.76-18.4); P = 0.02]. No association between DKK1 and presence of CAC was observed. ConclusionsOur results strongly suggest that bone turnover inhibitors, OPG and sclerostin, are independently associated with CAC with potential additive effects in ND-CKD patients.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcifications are common in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients and recently several studies have pointed out its relationship with increased morbidity and mortality. Adragão Score as been validated in hemodialysis and CKD patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the vascular calcification and mortality in a population of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods: The population was evaluated regarding several biological and laboratorial parameters. Vascular calcification was assessed by 8 point Adragão Score using plain X-ray of hands and hips. We performed descriptive statistics and to analyze the risk factors of mortality we used the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: We included in this study 62 PD patients (f = 31 m = 31, mean age = 53 years, mean follow-up = 42.5 months) from our renal unit. Our population were dialyzed with a mean Kt/V = 2.9 ± 1.2 and the mean values of the evaluated parameters were: hemoglobin = 11.8 g/dl, Ca = 9.1 mg/dl, P = 4.7 mg/dl, Ca x P = 43.0 mg2/dl2, PTH = 695.9 pg/ml and albumin = 3.7 g/dl. Using the Cox model we found that diabetes (β = 9.612, p= 0.008) and higher Adragão Score (β=0.135, p=0.030) independently influenced the mortality of our population, when adjusted for age, gender and left ventricular hypertrophy. Conclusions: In our population diabetes and vascular calcifications correlated with higher mortality, validating Adragão Score in this PD population.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease compared with the general population. In CKD, accelerated vascular calcification contributes to arterial stiffness and mortality. A blood test for calcification propensity was recently developed by measuring the maturation time (T50) of calciprotein particles in serum, with a lower T50 corresponding to a higher calcification propensity. The clinical correlates of T50 in KTRs are not known. Methods: We measured T50 in biobanked blood obtained 10 weeks after transplantation during two eras, 2000-2003 and 2009-2012. The cross-sectional clinical correlates of T50 were assessed in a linear regression model with stepwise entry and backward selection of covariates, excluding patients with missing values (1%). Results: Of 1886 eligible adult kidney or kidney-pancreas recipients during the two eras, 1435 (76%) had T50 measured. Hospital staff shortage excluded 161 patients and 290 were transferred to other hospitals before the investigation in week 10. The cohort was primarily Caucasian with mean age 52 ± 14 years, eGFR 57 ± 19 ml/min/1.73m2, male 66%, diabetes 29.1% including 9.3% post-transplant diabetes, simultaneous pancreas transplant 6%, rejection 23%, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection 39% and T50 196 ± 72 minutes.T50 was lower in the former era (beta -26 [95% CI -32 to -20], p<0.001), diabetes (-14 [-21 to 8], p<0.001), recipients of deceased donor kidney (18 [-24 to -11], p<0.001), recipients of a first kidney (-13 [-22 to -4], p=0.01), after rejection (-12 [-21 to -3], p=0.01), with higher dosed calcineurin inhibitors (highest quartile trough levels [tac >8.5 or csa >220 ng/mL]; -9 [-16 to -2], p=0.02) and higher prednisolone dose (≥12.5 mg; -34 [-42 to -25], p<0.001), CMV infection (-8 [-15 to -2], p=0.01) and higher phosphate (per 0.20 mmol/L; 36 [-39 to -33], p<0.001). This model explained 40% of the variance in T50. An association between eGFR and T50 was lost after adjustment for phosphate, suggesting phosphate is an intermediate variable. Other variables not independently associated with T50 included recipient age and gender, known cardiovascular disease, smoking, delayed graft function, thymoglobulin induction, diuretics, ionized calcium and log-transformed PTH. Conclusions: The clinical correlates of serum calcification propensity T50 included measures of kidney graft quality and function, intensity of immunosuppression, serum phosphate and inflammatory states such as rejection and CMV infection.

N2  - Warfarin inhibits vitamin-K dependent proteins involved in bone mineralization and the prevention of vascular calcification (bone Gla protein BGP, matrix Gla protein MGP). In this multicenter, cross-sectional study with 3-year follow-up, data from 387 patients on hemodialysis for 31 year at 18 dialysis units were analyzed. Patients on warfarin treatment for > 1 year (11.9% of the population) were compared with the remaining cohort for vertebral fractures, vascular calcifications and mortality. Vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications were sought in L-L vertebral X-rays (D5 to L4). Compared with controls, warfarin-treated male patients had more vertebral fractures (77.8 vs. 57.7%, p<0.04), but not females (42.1% vs. 48.4%, p=0.6); total BGP was significantly reduced (82.35 vs. 202 µg/L, p<0.0001), with lower levels in treated men (69.5 vs. women 117.0 µg/L, p=0.03). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, the use of warfarin was associated with increased odds of aortic (OR 2.58, p<0.001) and iliac calcifications (OR 2.86, p<0.001); identified confounders were age, atrial fibrillation, angina, PPI use and total BGP. Seventy-seven patients died during a 2.7±0.5 year follow-up. In univariate Cox regression analysis, patients on warfarin had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.42-4.16, p=0.001) when compared with those untreated and data adjustment for confounders attenuated but confirmed the significant warfarin-mortality link (HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.02-3.84, P=0.046). In hemodialysis patients, additional studies are warranted to verify the risk/benefit ratio of warfarin, which appears to be associated with significant morbidity and increased mortality.

N2  - Fractures, together with vascular calcifications constitute the main features of CKD mineral and bone disorders (CKDMBD) [1], a major complication of chronic uraemia, which severely affects patients' morbidity and mortality [2]. Indeed, fracture risk increases as renal function declines from CKD stages 3 to 5. In dialysed patients, fractures occur roughly 10 years earlier and hip fracture risk is about 4.5 fold compared to that of non-uremic patients. Clinical risk factors for fractures consist of the “classical” ones (age, female gender, low BMI, vascular calcifications, drugs) and those specific to CKD such as dialysis vintage and kidney transplantation or parathyroïdectomy history. The biological mechanisms which underlie the bone histologic lesions (referred to as “renal osteodystrophy”-ROD-) are being progressively unravelled. Overall, ROD involves anomalies of turnover which can be too high (osteitis fibrosa or “mixed uremic lesions”) or too low (adynamic bone disease) and defects in bone primary (osteomalacia or “mixed uremic lesions”) and secondary mineralisation. They result from the severe dysregulation of calcium and phosphate metabolism which occurs as soon as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) deteriorates [3]. Briefly, at earlier stages, the phosphate retention due to nephronic reduction, stimulates FGF23 secretion which exerts anti-vitamin D (VD) effects [4]. This, together with the resulting decrease in calcium intestinal absorption, triggers secondary hyperparathyroidism and leads to high bone turnover. Later on, CKD progressively causes the loss of various cell receptors (R). Indeed, parathorm one (PTH)-R expression decreases in bone, which leads to skeletal resistance to PTH and may participate to the development of low bone turnover. In parathyroid glands, expression of VDR, calcium sensing R and FGF23 R wanes over time, which promotes gland autonomisation. Many other mechanisms are currently being explored such as the increase in circulating sclerostin and Dkk1, two members of the wnt signalling system, accumulation of SIBLINGs proteins in bone extracellular matrix, chronic inflammation and dysregulation of energetic metabolism. Bone status assessment in CKD may be difficult. BMD measurement by DXA was not recommended by KDIGO (the “Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome” initiative) in 2009 [5] but recent papers showed that it predicts fractures in both dialysis [6], and predialysis [7,8] populations, as it does in the general population. The hip or the wrist may be the best sites, spine measurements being biased by superposition of aortic vascular calcifications. FRAX does not include CKD as a risk factor and may therefore underestimate the 10- year probability of fracture [9]. Interestingly, it was also shown that testing of neuromuscular function may discriminate well among fractured and non-fractured patients with Stage 5 CKD on dialysis [10]. HRpQCT studies showed that cortical bone is affected early, with a reduction in cortical thickness and an increase in cortical porosity, as compared to control populations, which was positively correlated to the time-averaged levels of serum PTH [11]. PTH serum levels have long been a surrogate albeit flawed marker for evaluating bone turnover, due to the more or less marked skeletal resistance to PTH. When associated to serum PTH, Bone Alkaline Phosphatase serum levels, which do not depend on GFR, are better predictors of bone turnover than PTH alone [12]. Because of the lack of specificity of biological markers, iliac crest bone biopsy may be sometimes necessary for histological diagnosis of the ROD type especially when administration of anti-osteoporotic drug is considered. The aim of CKD-induced osteoporosis treatment is triple: 1) to fight against phosphate retention (diet and chelation of dietary phosphate) 2) to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism via vitamin D (cholecalciferol and also one-alpha Vitamin D derivatives), calcium supplementation or even cinacalcet, a calcium sensing receptor agonist, 3) to treat bone fragility with anti-osteoporotic molecules. While the post- hoc analyses of pivotal studies suggested that bisphosphonates [13], denosumab [14] or teriparatide [15] are rather safe and efficacious in patients at CKD stage 2 and 3 (i.e., GFR >30 ml/min), there is no available information about drug safety or efficacy at stage 4 and 5 and all the more so in dialysed patients. Conclusion: Prospective studies evaluating anti-osteoporotic molecules, especially in patients at the later stages of the disease, are sorely lacking, making difficult if not impossible to rationally take care of CKD- associated osteoporosis. Thus, thorough tracking of secondary hyperparathyroidism and other fracture risk factors in CKD patients at early as possible in order to prevent worsening of bone fragility seems a reasonable recommendation.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease - mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex syndrome influenced by various factors, such as age, CKD etiology, uremic toxins, and dialysis modality. Although extensively studied in hemodialysis (HD) patients, only a few studies exist for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Since most of these older studies contain no bone biopsy data, we studied the pattern of renal osteodystrophy in 41 prevalent PD patients. The most common presentation was adynamic bone disease (49%). There was a significant inverse association between serum sclerostin (a Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor that decreases osteoblast action and bone formation) and the bone formation rate. Bone alkaline phosphatase had the best sensitivity and specificity to detect both high- and low-turnover diseases. The comparison between nondiabetic PD and HD patients, matched by age, gender, parathyroid hormone level, and length of dialysis, revealed low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, worse bone mineralization, and low bone turnover in the nondiabetic PD group. Thus, adynamic bone disease was the most frequent type of renal osteodystrophy in PD patients. Sclerostin seems to participate in the pathophysiology of adynamic bone disease and bone alkaline phosphatase was the best serum marker of bone turnover in these patients.

N2  - Context: Vascular calcification (VC) is prevalent and progressive in renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Recent cross-sectional data suggest that activated Wnt signaling contributes to VC. Objective: The objective was to investigate whether circulating levels of the Wnt antagonist sclerostin associate with progression of VC. Design: This was a post hoc analysis of the longitudinal observational Brussels Renal Transplant Cohort study. Setting: The setting was a tertiary care academic hospital. Patients: Coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification were measured by multislice spiral computerized tomography in 268 prevalent RTRs (age, 53 ± 13 y; 61% male) at baseline and remeasured in 189 patients after a median follow-up of 4.4 years. Baseline serum sclerostin levels were assessed on stored blood samples. Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of baseline VC and progression. Main outcome measure: The main outcome measure was progression of VC. Results: VC was present in up to 84% of participants at baseline. Almost half of the patients showed progression of VC, according to Hokanson criteria. The cross-sectional analysis at baseline demonstrated a direct association between sclerostin levels and VC score in univariate analysis, which became inverse after adjustment for age, gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level was identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline aorta calcification score in the final regression model. Moreover, baseline sclerostin levels showed an inverse association with VC progression, at least after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Conclusions: Serum sclerostin levels inversely associated with VC burden and progression in prevalent RTRs after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Our data corroborate previous findings in nontransplanted chronic kidney disease patients and support the notion that sclerostin may be up-regulated in the vascular wall during the VC process as part of a local counterregulatory mechanism directed to suppress VC. Additional clinical and experimental data are required for confirmation.

N2  - Sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation, is linked to mineral bone disorder. In order to validate its potential as a predictor of vascular calcification, we explored associations of circulating sclerostin with measures of calcification in 89 epigastric artery biopsies from patients with end-stage renal disease. Significantly higher sclerostin levels were found in the serum of patients with epigastric and coronary artery calcification (calcification score 100 or more). In Spearman's rank correlations, sclerostin levels significantly associated with age, intact parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and percent calcification. Multivariable regression showed that age, male gender, and sclerostin each significantly associated with the presence of medial vascular calcification. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that sclerostin (AUC 0.68) predicted vascular calcification. Vascular sclerostin mRNA and protein expressions were low or absent, and did not differ between calcified and non-calcified vessels, suggesting that the vasculature is not a major contributor to circulating levels. Thus, high serum sclerostin levels associate with the extent of vascular calcification as evaluated both by coronary artery CT and scoring of epigastric artery calcification. Among circulating biomarkers of mineral bone disorder, only sclerostin predicted vascular calcification.

N2  - Rationale and Objectives: Vascular calcification independently predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD), and computed tomography (CT) is a useful tool to evaluate and quantify not only coronary but also thoracic aortic calcification (TAC). Previous TAC progression reports were limited to dialysis and renal transplant patients. This is the first study to evaluate TAC progression in a large multiethnic cohort without clinically evident CVD at entry. Methods: Non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CTs were obtained in 5886 of 6814 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants (mean age, 62 years; 48% males; 40% white, 27% black, 21% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese). Baseline and follow-up TAC scores were derived. Results: Overall, 4308 (73%) participants had no detectable baseline TAC. Mean follow-up duration was 2.4 ± 0.8 years, during which 12% developed TAC. The overall incidence rate was 4.8%/year and was greater with age across gender and ethnic groups; TAC incidence was significantly lower in blacks than whites. After adjustment for follow-up duration, regression analyses showed age, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensives, and smoking were associated with incident TAC. A total of 1578 (27%) participants had TAC at baseline with a positive association between average annual TAC change and baseline age. Although the overall median change was 32.9 (-1.4 to 112.2) Agatston units, 27% showed an annual score change of ≥100 and blacks showed the lowest median across ethnic groups; 22.7 (-3 to 86.8). Age, systolic blood pressure, lipid-lowering medication, diabetes, and smoking were associated with TAC progression. Conclusions: In MESA, traditional CV risk factors were related to both TAC incidence and progression. Blacks had the lowest incidence and median change across ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings for coronary calcification.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The objective of the study was to assess the correlates of common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT) and the relationship between the CCA-IMT and radial artery calcification in end-stage renal disease patients (ESRD) patients. Methods: The study comprised 98 stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients (66 hemodialyzed and 32 predialysis). The examined parameters included CCA-IMT, BMI, fasting blood glucose, the incidence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG), total calcium (Ca), phosphate (Pi), intact parathormone (iPTH), high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). In 59 patients (36 hemodialyzed and 13 predialysis), fragments of radial artery obtained during creation of hemodialysis access were stained for calcifications using von Kossa method and alizarin red. Results: CCA-IMT did not differ between predialysis and hemodialyzed patients ( p=0.9). Among studied parameters, fasting blood glucose (R=0.30; p=0.017), OPG (R=0,47; p=0.0003), age (R=0.65; p<0.0001) and serum creatinine (R=-0.25; p=0.046) were significantly correlated with CCA-IMT in simple analysis. Moreover, CCA-IMT was higher in patients with impaired fasting glucose or diabetes (0.98±0.13 vs 0.88 ±0.15 mm; p=0.007). In multiple regression, only age significantly predicted CCA-IMT (beta=0.51, p=0.0009). In histologically assessed subgroup, radial artery calcifications were detected in 34 patients (58%). Patients with calcifications presented higher CCA-IMT (0.98±0.13 versus 0.86±0.14 mm; p=0.006). The relation between CCA-IMT and histologically detected vascular calcification remained significant after adjustment for dialysis status, gender, Ca x Pi, iPTH, CRP and BMI (OR 2.24 per 0.1 mm increase in CCA-IMT; 95%CI 1.06-4.70; p=0.025) but not after adjustment for fasting blood glucose or age. Conclusions: Small samples of radial artery obtained during routine creation of vascular access for hemodialysis may successfully serve as source of the material for histological assessment of vascular mineralization. In ESRD patients, CCA-IMT may serve as non-invasive method to assess risk for vascular calcification.

N2  - Introduction: Vascular calcification is thought to be associated with a significant mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease. It is well recognized that the prevalence of vascular calcification increases with progressively decreasing kidney function. Although the KDIGO recommended that a lateral abdominal radiograph be used to detect the presence or absence of vascular calcification, the risk factors for progression of calcification are not clearly elucidated. Therefore, we investigate the predictors of vascular calcification progression in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Methods: This study was prospective observational study. Lateral lumbar radiography of the abdominal aorta was used to evaluate the overall abdominal aorta calcification (AAC) score, which is related to the severity of calcific deposits at lumbar vertebral segments L1-L4. Lumbar radiography was performed at baseline and after 1 year, respectively. The progression of AAC score was defined by any increase in Δcalcification (the change of AAC score). Results: The subjects were 124 patients on maintenance hemodialysis. 68 (58.1%) were female. The mean age was 57.2 ± 10.9 years, and the vintage of dialysis was 56.7 ± 53.8 months. The underlying renal diseases were diabetes mellitus in 66 (56.4%) patients. The mean baseline AAC score of the study population was 6.2 ± 6.0. The independent risk factors of AAC were age, presence of cardiovascular diseases, and dialysis vintage. Sixty-five patients (53%) showed AAC progression after 1 year. In a multivariate analysis, the presence of AAC at baseline (p = 0.017) was an independent risk factors for AAC progression in hemodialysis patients. No significant association with AAC progression was found between the baseline and follow up clinical parameters, including gender, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and dialysis vintage. Conclusion: This study identified that the risk factor related with AAC progression in hemodialysis patients was the presence of AAC at baseline. Patients should be carefully evaluated and managed from early stage to prevent development and progression of AAC.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification is prevalent and progressive in renal transplant recipients. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist produced by osteocytes, might protect against progression of vascular calcification (VC). Methods: This is an extension of the previously reported longitudinal observational Brussels Renal Transplant Cohort study. Coronary artery (CAC) and aortic calcification (AoC) was measured by multislice spiral CT in 268 prevalent renal transplant recipients. A repeat scan was available in 189 patients after a median follow-up of 4.4 years. In addition to traditional and non-traditional risk factors, baseline serum sclerostin levels (Tecomedical) were assessed on stored blood samples. Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of baseline VC and progression. Results: VC was present in up to 84% of participants at baseline. Almost half of the patients showed progression of VC, according to Hokanson criteria. The cross-sectional analysis demonstrated a direct association at baseline between sclerostin levels and VC score in univariate analysis, which became inverse after adjustment for age, gender and PTH level. Remarkably, a lower sclerostin level was identified as an independent determinant of a higher baseline AoC score in the final regression model. The longitudinal cohort study showed an inverse association between baseline sclerostin levels and VC progression, but significance was lost in most final models. Baseline VC is the most important risk factor for future progression. Conclusions: Sclerostin levels inversely associated with vascular calcification burden and progression in prevalent renal transplant recipients after adjustment for traditional risk factors. These data corroborate previous findings in non-transplanted CKD patients and support the thesis that sclerostin is up-regulated in the vascular wall during the vascular calcification process as part of a local counter regulatory mechanism directed to suppress vascular calcification.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification is common and progressive in chronic kidney disease, and vascular calcification increases the risk of cardiovascular events. However, in CKD patients, the extent to which vascular calcification is advanced with regards to the progression of renal failure remains to be further elucidated. The aim of the present study was to quantitatively examine factors associated with aortic calcification in predialysis CKD patients. Methods:We quantitatively investigated presence or degree of aortic calcification in 149 predialysis CKD patients (58±16 years; 96 males and 53 females, 48 diabetics; eGFR 40.3±29.3 ml/min), and measured Agatston scores using a 64-slice CT scanner (Somatom Sensation 64; Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany), in which images were obtained with a 3 mm single slice thickness. The aorta distal to the renal artery to the bifurcation was examined. Aortic calcification was defined as the volume of 2 adjacent pixels with a CT density of > 130 Hounsfield units within the distribution of the abdominal aorta. Results: Of 149 patients, aortic calcification was present in 117, and absent in 32. In patients with aortic calcification, age (p<0.001), C-reactive protein (p<0.001), and intact-PTH (p < 0.001) were significantly higher, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly lower ( p<0.001), and diabetes was observed more often ( p<0.05). In regards to the degree of aortic calcification, the Agatston scores correlated significantly and positively with age (ρ=0.438, p<0.001) and serum phosphate (ρ=0.208, p=0.024), and correlated significantly but negatively with e-GFR (ρ=-0.353, p<0.001). Agatston scores increased according with advances in the CKD stages. In multiple regression analysis, eGFR and serum phosphate were associated significantly with log [Agatston score] (β = - 0.261, p = 0.003; β = 0.147, p = 0.046, respectively) after the adjustment of several confounders (R2 = 0.333, p < 0.001; R2 = 0.295, p < 0.001, respectively). However, log [intact PTH] was not associated with log [Agatston score] after the adjustment. eGFR was associated significantly and independently with the log [Agatston score] (β=-0.346, p<0.01), after adjustment for several confounders including age, gender, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, log [CRP], smoking, serum phosphate, and log [intact-PTH] (R2 = 0.301, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Hyperphospatemia, chronic inflammation, diabetes, and decreased GFR are associated significantly with the presence of aortic calcification in predialysis CKD patients. Decreased eGFR was associated significantly and independently with advancement of the quantitative degree of aortic calcification.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcification is prevalent and strongly predicts all-cause mortality in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Renal allograft calcification is a possible factor contributing to graft failure. Recently, a blood test was invented that provides an overall measure of calcification propensity by monitoring the maturation time (T50) of calciprotein particles.We prospectively investigated the hypothesis that serum T50 is associated with mortality and graft failure in stable RTR. Methods: Serum calcification propensity was tested in a cohort of stable RTR with a functioning graft for ≥1 year between 2008 and 2011. Determinants of serum T50 were evaluated using multivariate linear regression models. Associations between T50 and the risk of all-cause mortality and death-censored graft failure were assessed using Cox regression analyses with adjustment for known risk factors. Results: The cohort consisted of 699 stable RTR (57% male, aged 53±13 years) with baseline measurements performed at 5.4 [1.9-12.1] (median [IQR]) years after kidney transplantation (KTx). Mean serum T50 was 286±62 minutes. During follow-up for 3.1 [2.7-3.9] years, 81 patients died (12%) and 45 patients developed graft failure (6%). Serum magnesium, albumin, PTH, and venous HCO3- were positively associated with T50. Serum phosphate, NT Pro-BNP, Hb, and use of vitamin K antagonists were inversely associated with T50. All together, these parameters explain 42% of the variation in T50. In Cox regression analyses, T50 was inversely associated with all-cause mortality, both univariate and after adjustment for age, gender, renal function, common cardiovascular risk factors and determinants of T50; hazard ratio (HR) 0.67 (95% CI 0.46-0.98), P=0.037 per standard deviation (SD) increase. T50 was also inversely associated with graft failure, again both univariate and after adjustment for possible confounders (age, gender, renal function, and PTH); HR 0.57 (0.40-0.81), P=0.002 per SD increase. Conclusions: Increased serum calcification propensity, i.e. reduced serum T50, is independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and graft failure in stable RTR. Further studies are needed to clarify whether therapeutic targeting of serum T50 improves long-term outcome after KTx.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcifications are a common phenomenon that contribute to arterial stiffening in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients; however, its pathology is not very well understood. Vascular stiffness is associated with morbidity and mortality in this population. Fetuin-A is involved in mineral metabolism and acts as an endogenous inhibitor of calcification. Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is a reliable marker of inflammation in CKD. The study was conducted to investigate the associations of fetuin-a, pentraxin-3 and aortic stiffness in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD patients. Methods: The study was performed on 40 diabetic stage 3-5 CKD patients, 40 non-diabetic stage 3-5 CKD patients and 40 non-uremic non-diabetic controls who were matched for age and gender. Exclusion criteria included any documentation of cardiovascular event, malignancy, and active infection.Fetuin-A (Elisa), PTX3 (Elisa), hemoglobin, hematocrit, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25(OH)D vitamin, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, albumin and fibrinogen levels were determined. By M-mode echocardiography and tissue doppler echocardiography, elastic properties of aorta was calculated and an aortic stiffness index was determined. Results: The mean aortic stiffness index was higher both in diabetic CKD (0.148 ±0.005) and non-diabetic CKD group (0.142±0.004) than the control group (0.102 ±0.004); p=0,0001, but did not statistically differ between diabetics and non-diabetic groups. The mean fetuin-A levels (ng/ml) were lower in diabetic CKD (17.4±10.4) and non-diabetic CKD (18.1±10.5) than controls (42.3±16.8); p=0,0001. The mean Pentraxin-3 level (ng/ml) were higher in diabetic CKD (1.13±0.2) and non-diabetic CKD group (1.04 ±0.24) than the control group (0.33 ±0.39), p=0,0001; diabetics had statistically higher levels of PTX3 than non-diabetics (p=0.022). The mean 25(OH)D levels (pg/ml) were significantly lower in in diabetic CKD (25.7±9.3) and non-diabetic CKD (26.1±10.9) than controls (42.4±9.8); p=0.001.(Pentraxin-3 levels were positively correlated with aortic stiffness (r=0.410, P=0.0001). Fetuin-A levels were negatively correlated with aortic stiffness (r=-0.283, P=0.002). Fetuin-A showed negative correlations with duration of CKD, blood glucose, HBA1c, PTH, serum phosphorus levels. Fetuin-A levels were positively correlated with 25(OH)D vitamin levels. Aortic stiffness index showed negative correlations with serum albumin, body mass index, 25 (OH)D3 vitamin, and diastolic blood pressure. Aortic stiffness index showed positive correlations with serum creatinine, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, uric acid, CRP, PTH, pulse pressure and systolic blood pressure. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate increased aortic stiffness in stage 3-5 diabetic and non-diabetic CKD patients. Serum fetuin-A levels negatively reflected whereas pentraxin-3 levels positively reflected an increase in aortic stiffness. Based on our results, fetuin-A and pentraxin-3 could be used as risk factors for progression of aortic stiffness and therefore may have prognostic value in the follow up of these patients with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular access (VA) function and patency are essential for optimal management of hemodialysis (HD) patients. Loss of patency of the VA limits HD delivery and may result in underdialysis that leads to increased morbidity and mortality. The stimuli responsible for intimal hyperplastic response in the venous outflow tract are multifactorial and include hemodynamic factos, as well as atherosclerotic vascular disease and vascular inflammation. Other factors include diabetes mellitus, anticardiolipin antibodies, patient age, previous use of a dialysis catheter, hypoalbuminemia, and high serum levels of lipoprotein A and fibronectin. Vascular calcifications are highly prevalent in dialysis patients and are associated with arterial stiffness and mortality. Teresa Adragão et al, developed a simple vascular calcification score (SVCS) predictor of cardiovascular mortality and higher vascular calcification and arterial stiffness.The NKF-K/DOQ recommended several diagnostic procedures for VA surveillance, including duplex ultrasound, blood flow (Qa), intra-access static pressure, access recirculation and others.Decreasing Qa add predictive power for the detection of access stenosis, thrombosis and loss of VA patency.We try to find if SCVS and other clinical and analitical parameters affect Qa values as a way to improve VA surveillance. Methods: Transversal study in 40 patients in regular hemodialysis. Qa value was obtained with TD and DU method in the same week.Demographic variables such as race, age, gender, diabetes and arterial hypertension status, time on dialysis, VA type and time, first VA or not, previous interventions (endovasculars or surgicals), SCVS, serum parathyroid hormone, calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate and magnesium levels, mean static venous and arterial pressure, online clearance monitor (OCM), recirculation were recorded. We also recorded alterations observed with DU like stenotic lesions, their location, number and hemodynamic meaning.We used SPSS 20.0. Pearson coefficient was made to find correlation between both Qa measurement methods. KruskalWallis and Mann-Whitney Test were made to compare both Qa measures in multiple groups. Results: Pearson coeficiente betwenn DU-Qa and TD-Qa was 0,851, p-value ,000 (< 0,05). DU-Qa varied significantly with age (p 0,012), VA type (0,021), SCVS (all categories) (p 0,030), mean intra-access arterial pressure (p 0,015) and time on dialysis (p 0,002). TD-Qa only varied significantly with diabetes status (p 0,027), age (p 0,017), first or not VA (p 0,036), SCVS (> or < 4) (p 0,007), mean intra-access arterial pressure (p 0,028) and time on dialysis (p 0,001) On the other hand, gender, hypertensive status and analitical parameters related with metabolism bone disease and vascular calcification didńt change Q values. Conclusions: TD represents a good indirect method of DU-Qa measurement. However they vary differently with VA and patiet-related factors. Higher SVCS was associated with lower DU and TD-Qas. DU-Qas values were more sensitive to changes in SCVS giving this method an advantage towards the indirect one. Adding to this, simple and inexpensive methods such as SVCS may be used to increase importante information that may be relevant for new surveillance recommendations (at least on high risk groups) helping guiding therapeutic interventions.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Cardiovascular calcifications are an important risk factor for cardiovascular events in patients on dialysis. Pulse pressure also appears to be a stronger independent predictor of morbidity and mortality than other blood pressure (BP) parameters such as systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BP among hemodialysis patients. The use of simple and inexpensive methods to evaluate cardiovascular calcifications is preferred. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of pulse pressure parameter with aortic and mitral valve calcification, and abdominal aortic calcification in HD patients. Methods:We performed a cross-sectional study in 85 stable patients treated with HD for more than 6 months. Patients were 49.9 ± 12.4 years of age, 58% males, 17% diabetics and the mean dialysis vintage was 51.5 ± 28.7 months. Demographic and biochemical data were examined. Blood pressure was measured with the patient in the seated position using a mercury sphygmomanometer. The mean of three consecutive readings, taken 1 min apart, was recorded. Plain X-ray images of lateral lumbar spine from all subjects were studied for calculation of semiquantitative vascular calcification scores as described by Kauppila. The severity of the anterior and posterior aortic wall calcification were graded individually on a 0-3 scale for each lumbar segment and the results were summarized to develop a score (range 0-24). Echocardiograms were examined for absence or presence of calcification of the mitral and aortic valve. Results: Mean pulse pressure of study population was 55.72 ± 14.32 mmHg. Fifty nine patients (69.4%) were identified with aortic abdominal calcification, and the mean Kauppila score was 4.91 ± 4.05. Sixty patients (70.5%) had at least one valve calcified, while thirty three patients (38.8%) had both valves calcified. Univariate analysis revealed that every 1 mmHg increase in pulse pressure was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular calcification p=0.020. In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes mellitus, cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, the association also remained strong, where every increase of 1 mm Hg in pulse pressure was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular calcification p=0.038. Conclusions: Pulse pressure may identify hemodialysis patients with subclinical cardiovascular calcification who need further evaluation.We must highly suspect the presence of cardiovascular calcification in hemodialysis patients with high pulse pressure.

N2  - Background/Aim: Vascular calcification is associated with cardiovascular risk in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Previous reports have shown that simple assessment of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) using plain radiography is associated with cardiovascular mortality in the general population. We conducted a prospective study to investigate factors associated with the presence at baseline and progression of AoAC in MHD patients and examined its prognostic value in a short-term outcome. Methods: We prospectively evaluated chest X-rays in 301 asymptomatic MHD patients. The extent of AoAC was divided into three Grades (0, 1, 2+3). Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and biochemical data were assessed and the patients were then followed for 3 years. Results: AoAC was observed in 126 patients (41.9%) as Grade 0, in 112 patients (37.2%) as Grade 1, and in 63 patients (20.9%) as Grade 2 and 3 at baseline. An increase in the severity of calcification was associated with older male patients who had lower serum albumin levels. During the follow-up period of 3 years, multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients with AoAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis and the grade of AAC also influenced their survival. Moreover, all-cause death rates were significantly higher in the progression groups than in the non-progression groups. Conclusions: The presence and progression of AoAC assessed by chest X-ray were independently associated with mortality in MHD patients. Regular follow-up by chest X-ray could be a simple and useful method to stratify mortality risk in MHD patients.

N2  - Aim Vascular calcification (VC) is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the strong prevalence of cardiovascular and CKD-related risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and phosphate retention. Kidney transplantation improves kidney function and abnormal mineral metabolism at the same time. It remains unclear whether kidney transplantation favourably impacts VC in the long-term. Methods The present study examined VC in 132 kidney transplant (KT) recipients who had been transplanted for longer than one year. The severity of VC was compared to 129 CKD stages 5-5D patients on a kidney transplant (KT) waiting list. Results The median KT vintage was 88 months. The prevalence of VC among KT and CKD patients were 54.5% and 62.8%, respectively, (P=0.2). There were no differences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), the prevalence of DM or CVD between the two groups. Among patients with calcification, a more severe degree was observed in KT recipients (P=0.01). Aging, DM, CVD and dialysis vintage were associated with significant VC in both groups. The degree of VC in KT recipients was more pronounced than that in CKD patients among those who experienced prolonged dialysis vintage (>2 years) (P=0.04). Among KT recipients, the severity of VC increased with the length of time after transplantation and became more substantial after 5 years. Conclusions Long-term KT recipients demonstrated a more severe degree of VC compared to matched CKD stages 5-5D patients. The severity of VC became more pronounced among those with longer transplant vintage and was in part influenced by past dialysis experience. Summary at a Glance This study assesses vascular calcification (VC) in kidney transplant recipients and matched patients on dialysis. Not surprisingly, prevalence and determinants of VC were similar for both groups. Of interest, VC severity was greater in transplant patients than in patients on dialysis. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm these data. © 2014 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Aim Vascular calcification (VC) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, and an inverse relationship of VC to bone mineral density (BMD) has been reported. Because elderly patients are prone to atherosclerosis and BMD artefact, we examined the prevalence and epidemiology of VC in younger patients undergoing transplantation, and its relationship to BMD. Methods Laboratory testing was performed immediately before kidney or simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. Within 4 weeks patients underwent BMD evaluation and lateral abdominal X-ray. Aortic calcification was scored using a validated 24-point scale. Results Of 650 consecutive patients X-rays were available for 531 (82%). Their median age was 41 years (16-71), 58% were male, dialysis vintage was 20 months (0-402) and 69% had kidney and 31% SPK transplants. VC scores were ≥1 in 47%, with the median score 6 (1-24) and was associated with age, dialysis vintage and presence of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease. In a multivariate analysis of patients with and without VC, those with VC were older and of longer dialysis vintage (OR 1.07 and 1.17 per 12 months respectively; P < 0.001 for both). In that analysis, VC was not significantly associated with gender, transplant type, presence of diabetes, current or former smoking or calcium or calcitriol therapy, and was not inversely related to hip, spine or forearm BMD Z-scores. Conclusion VC is common in younger patients undergoing transplantation and, similar to older patients, is associated with age, dialysis vintage and cardiovascular pathology. However, in this younger patient group, there was no significant inverse association of VC to BMD. Summary at a Glance This group examined the prevalence and epidemiology of vascular calcification in younger patients undergoing kidney only or kidney-pancreas transplantation. They found it to be common in younger patients and resembled the older patients being associated with age, dialysis vintage and cardiovascular pathology. There was no difference in calcification between the type of transplant done and no significant inverse association of the calcification with bone mineral density. © 2014 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Several risk factors for arterial calcification have been reported but controversial. The aim of this study was to clarify the interactions among chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and dyslipidemia in altering the risk of arterial calcification in the three different arterial locations and the intramural location at the internal carotid artery (ICA) origins. Calcified burdens at the ICA origins, the aortic arch, and its orifices were evaluated in a retrospective fashion by using computed tomography angiography in 397 patients. The multivariate analyses were adjusted for age, gender, CKD, DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and current smoking status. Additionally, subgroup analyses in each variable were conducted. Our multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that CKD was significantly associated with the outside-wall calcification at the ICA origins, whereas DM was only associated with the inside-ICA-wall calcification. Additionally, we found that DM increased the association between CKD and arterial calcification at the aortic arch and its orifices, and the outside-wall at the ICA origins. Hypertension was significantly associated with the calcification at the orifices of the aortic arch branches synergistically with CKD. Dyslipidemia did not have any significant association with calcification in any of the three vascular beds. CKD had the highest prevalence risk of calcification in common with the three different vascular beds. CKD in combination with DM, as well as hypertension in combination with CKD, were key relationships affecting the risk of arterial calcification, especially at the aortic arch and its orifices. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

N2  - Purpose: In patients on dialysis, the most common cause of death is cardiovascular disease. This is caused, at least in part, by excessive vascular calcification. Studies that have examined coronary calcification have been published, but these measurements require expensive equipment. Here, we used computed tomography to determine aortic calcification and evaluated these data as prognostic markers for cardiovascular disease. Methods: Computed tomography with contrast medium was performed on 49 patients undergoing hemodialysis (29 males and 20 females; average age, 68.9 ± 11.0 years). A calcification score (CS) was defined as the ratio of the volume of vascular calcification to the volume of the thoracic aorta. All patients were monitored for cardiovascular end points, which included cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic, or echocardiographic abnormalities that suggested myocardial ischemia, cardiac surgery, leg amputation, and hospitalization or death due to heart failure. Results: Patients were followed for 3 years, with 12 patients reaching the end point. Both high CS (p = 0.007) and male gender (p = 0.009) were significantly associated with cardiovascular events. In contrast, events were not related to age, dialysis duration, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, pulse-wave velocity, maximum intima-media thickness of the carotid artery wall, systolic blood pressure, or left ventricular hypertrophy. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a high baseline CS was a significant predictor for cardiovascular events ( p < 0.05). Conclusions: Calcification of the thoracic aorta determined by three-dimensional computed tomography predicts cardiovascular complications in patients on hemodialysis. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.

N2  - Background: Sclerostin (Scl) has recently emerged as a novel marker of bone remodeling and vascular calcification. However, whether high circulating Scl is also a risk factor for death is not well established. The purpose of this study was to test whether serum Scl would be associated with mortality. Methods: we measured serum Scl in a hemodialysis patients' cohort, which was followed during a ten-year period. Competing risk regression models were applied, as during the follow-up, patients were exposed to both events kidney transplant and death. Results: Ninety-one patients aged 42.3 ± 18.8 years (55% of male gender, 15% of diabetes) were included. During the follow-up, 32 patients underwent kidney transplant and 26 patients died. Non-survivals presented higher FGF23, higher Scl and lower creatinine. There was an association between all-cause mortality and higher Scl (HR = 2.2), higher age (HR = 1.04) and presence of diabetes (HR = 2.27), by competing risk analyses. Even including potential markers of mortality, as creatinine, FGF 23, and gender, Scl, age and diabetes remained significantly related to higher mortality. Conclusion: Serum Scl is an independent predictor of mortality in dialysis patients. However, whether clinical interventions to modulate Scl would be able to improve these patients survival needs to be determined.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular calcification represents a marker of cardiovascular risk in chronic dialysis patients. In the general population, aortic arch calcification (AAC) can predict cardiovascular mortality. We conducted a prospective study to investigate factors associated with AAC in hemodialysis patients and examined its prognostic value in long-term outcome. Methods: A total of 712 hemodialysis patients were enrolled. AAC was identified on postero-anterior chest X-ray films and classified as grade (Gr.) 0, 1, 2 or 3. Demographic data including age, gender, dialysis vintage, co-morbidity and biochemical data were reviewed and recorded. The patients were followed for 10 years. Results: AAC was present in 164 patients (23%) as Gr. 1, in 116 patients (16.3%) as Gr. 2 and in 126 patients (17.7%) as Gr. 3. An increase in the severity of calcification was associated with older patients who had lower albumin, higher calcium and glucose levels. During the follow-up period of 10 years, we found that the grade of AAC was directly related to cardiovascular mortality (Gr. 0: 5.3%; Gr. 1: 12.7%; Gr. 2: 18.9%, and Gr. 3: 24.4%; p < 0.05) and all-cause mortality (Gr. 0: 19.9%; Gr. 1: 31.1%; Gr. 2: 44.8%, and Gr. 3: 53.2%; p < 0.001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that high-grade calcification was associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Patients with AAC were associated with a worse outcome in survival analysis. The severity of AAC also influenced their survival. Conclusion: Calcification of the aortic arch detected in plain chest radiography was an important determinant of cardiovascular as well as all-cause mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients. The presence and severity of AAC predicted long-term survival.

N2  - Objectives: Low triiodothyronine levels, as part of the nonthyroidal illness syndrome, are common in dialysis patients and have repeatedly been shown to be associated with increased (cardiovascular) mortality rates. We hypothesized that increased vascular calcification may mediate this relationship. Methods: A total of 84 patients from the Stockholm region receiving maintenance peritoneal dialysis were included in the study. Serum concentrations of free triiodothyronine (fT3), thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone were measured. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores were assessed by cardiac computed tomography scans. Surrogates of arterial stiffness included aortic diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse pressure, augmentation pressure and Buckberg's subendocardial viability ratio measured by pulse waveform analyses. Patients were subsequently followed, and events of death and censoring were recorded. Thyroid hormone concentrations were associated with CAC scores, measures of arterial stiffness and all-cause mortality. The associations between CAC scores and arterial stiffness surrogates and mortality were also determined to evaluate a possible causal pathway. Results: Both CAC scores and arterial stiffness surrogates were substantially higher in individuals with low fT3 levels. These associations persisted in multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 32 (22-42) months, 24 patients died. Both fT3 levels below the median value [HR crude 4.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-12.6] and CAC scores above the median value (HR crude 5.8, 95% CI 1.7-20.1) were strongly associated with mortality. Conclusions: In patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, fT3 levels were strongly associated with arterial stiffness, coronary artery calcification and mortality. We speculate that the association between nonthyroidal illness and mortality may be partly mediated by acceleration of vascular calcification. © 2013 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification (VC) contributes to high mortality rates in chronic kidney disease (CKD). High serum phosphate and FGF23 levels and impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 may affect VC. Therefore, their relative contribution to abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) was examined in patients CKD stages 3-4. Methods. Potential risk factors for AAC, measured by the Kauppila Index (KI), were studied in 178 patients. Results: In multivariate linear analysis, AAC associated positively with age, male gender, CKD-stage, presence of carotid plaques (CP) and also with FGF23, but negatively with fractional excretion of phosphate (FEP). Intriguingly, FEP increased with similar slopes with elevations in PTH, with reductions in GFR, and also with elevations in FGF23 but the latter only in patients with none (KI = 0) or mild (KI = 1-5) AAC. Lack of a FEP-FGF23 correlation in patients with severe AAC (KI > 5) suggested a role for an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 but not to PTH in AAC. Logistic and zero-inflated analysis confirmed the independent association of age, CKD stage, male gender and CP with AAC, and also identified a threshold FEP/FGF23 ratio of 1/3.9, below which the chances for a patient of presenting severe AAC increased by 3-fold. Accordingly, KI remained unchanged as FEP/FGF23 ratios decreased from 1/1 to 1/3.9 but markedly increased in parallel with further reductions in FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9. Conclusions: In CKD 3-4, an impaired phosphaturic response to FGF23 with FEP/FGF23 < 1/3.9 associates with severe AAC independently of age, gender or CP. © 2013 Craver et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Renal transplant recipients have an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease. Arterial stiffness (AS) and aortic calcifications (ACs) are well-known CV risk factors in patients with chronic kidney disease. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of AS and AC in incident renal transplant recipients (RTRs). We conducted a prospective study in 253 single RTR. AC were scored by means of lumbar X-ray. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed in a subgroup of 115 patients. AC were present in 61% of patients. After a mean follow-up of 36 months, 32 CV events occurred in the overall group and 13 events in the PWV subgroup. When we accounted for age, gender, and CV history, AC score (HR, hazard ratio 1.09 per 1 unit increase; 95% CI 1.02-1.17) and PWV (HR 1.45 per 1 m/s; 95% CI 1.16-1.8) remained an independent predictor of CV events in Cox-regression analyses. Using receiver operating characteristics, the area under the curve for predicting CV events amounted to 0.80 and 0.72 for sum AC and PWV, respectively. Both AS and AC are strong predictors of future CV events in an incident RTR population. These vascular assessments are readily available and easy to perform, making them ideal tools for further risk stratification. © 2013 Steunstichting ESOT.

N2  - Disorders of bone and mineral metabolism contribute to an increased prevalence of vascular calcification (VC) with its adverse clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The pathogenesis of VC is not fully understood. Fetuin-A is one of the inhibitors of calcification whose level is lowered in patients with CKD. In addition fetuin-A 256Ser/Ser (allele G) might affect serum fetuin-A levels. The aim of this work was to study the association between fetuin-A and its gene and VC and also with bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with CKD on conservative treatment, on maintenance of hemodialysis (HD) and those who underwent renal transplantation.This study included twenty eight CKD patients on HD, seventeen CKD patients on conservative treatment and twelve patients who underwent transplantation in addition to sixteen healthy controls. All were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, laboratory investigations including fasting serum glucose, urea, creatinine, albumin, lipid profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), estimated glomerular filteration rate (e-GFR), calcium, phosphorus, calcium by phosphorus product (Ca×PO4), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), alkaline phosphatase (Alk), fetuin-A and genotyping for the common functional polymorphisms on fetuin-A (Thr256Ser) using the Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Radiological examination included ultrasonography of carotid arteries and assessment of VC by plain X-ray and assessment of BMD.Serum calcium was lower, phosphorus, Ca×PO4, iPTH and Alk were higher in all patient groups than control. Fetuin-A was lower in all patient groups compared to controls. VC was detected in 39.2% HD patients, 29.4% patients on conservative treatment and 25% patients on transplantation. T-score of BMD was significantly lower in all patient groups than control. There was no statistically significant difference between patients and control groups according to the frequencies of the three fetuin-A genotypes (C. →. G) but the distribution of the fetuin-A (C. →. G); Thr256Ser gene polymorphisms in the studied subjects showed significant correlation with low serum fetuin-A levels. VC was associated with older age, male gender, longer HD duration, lower albumin, higher LDL-c, higher carotid plaques and lower T-score value of BMD.VC was evident in patients with CKD and it is related to atherosclerosis and lower BMD. Fetuin-A was lower in all patients with CKD with significant relation between serum fetuin-A level and its gene polymorphism but not with VC. © 2013.

N2  - Development of CKD-mineral and bone disorder (MBD) increases morbidity and mortality in men and women with CKD. The corresponding link among bone disease, fracture, and extraskeletal calcifications has been the subject of much focus. In the general population, the incidence of cardiovascular disease is higher in men than women, and this gender differences in degree of calcification and morbidity is maintained in kidney disease. Gender differences in phosphorus and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) have been described. Increases in both have been linked with increasing likelihood of death in the CKD population as a whole; however, this link is not as well described when looking at women alone. The clinical significance of these differences, and the potential associated outcomes, are poorly understood. Traditional understanding of bone disease in women without kidney disease may not be fully applicable in women with CKD. Use of bone densitometry is limited in this population, and the traditional preventative interventions may not be fully transferrable to women with CKD. © 2013 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

N2  - Context: Sclerostin, a Wnt antagonist produced by osteocytes, regulates osteoblast activity and is a well-established key player inboneturnover. Recent data indicate that theWntpathwaymayalso be involved in vascular calcification. Objective: The present study tests the hypothesis that serum sclerostin levels are associated with vascular calcification in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not yet receiving dialysis. Design, Setting, Participants, and Measurements: We performed a cross-sectional analysis in 154 patients with CKD. Aortic calcification (AC) was assessed by lumbar X-ray and scored with a maximum score of 24. In addition to traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, serum sclerostin levels were assessed (ELISA). Regression analysis was performed to identify determinants of serum sclerostin and AC. Results: AC was present in 59% of patients. Older age (P < .0001), male sex (P = .006), lower estimated glomerular rate (eGFR) (P = .0008), lower bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P = .03), and the absence of AC (P = .006) were identified as independent determinants of higher serum sclerostin levels. In univariate logistic regression, higher age, diabetes,CVhistory, higher body mass index, higher serum C-reactive protein and sclerostin levels and lower estimated glomerular rate were all associated with the presence of AC. In multivariate analysis, lower, not higher, sclerostin levels (P = .04, odds ratio [OR] per ng/mL of 0.24), higher age (P < .0001, OR per year of 1.17) and CV history (P = .02, OR for a positive CV history of 3.83) were identified as independent determinants of AC. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients with CKD, we found that patients with aortic calcifications (ACs) had higher sclerostin levels. However, in multivariate analysis, the association became inverse. Additional clinical and experimental studies are urgently required to clarify whether or not sclerostin protects against progression of vascular calcification.

N2  - There is a significant relationship between the presence, extent and progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and cardiovascular (CV) events and mortality in both CV and renal patients and CAC scoring can provide improved predictive ability over risk factor scoring alone. There is also a close relationship between CAC presence and atherosclerotic plaque burden, with angiography studies showing very high sensitivity but poor specificity of CAC score for predicting obstructive disease. Nevertheless, there are objections to CAC screening because of uncertainties and lack of studies showing improved outcome. Furthermore, histopathology studies indicate that heavily calcified plaque is unlikely to result in a CV event, while the vulnerable plaque tends to be uncalcified or 'mixed', suggesting that calcification may be protective. This scenario highlights a number of paradoxes, which may indicate that the association between CAC and CV events is spurious, following from the adoption of CAC as a surrogate for high plaque burden, which itself is a surrogate for the presence of vulnerable plaque. Since studies indicate that arterial calcification is a complex, organised and regulated process similar to bone formation, there is no particular reason why it should be a reliable indicator of either the plaque burden or the risk of a future CV event. We suggest that it is time to divorce arterial calcification from atherosclerosis and to view it as a distinct pathology in its own right, albeit one which frequently coexists with atherosclerosis and is related to it for reasons which are not yet fully understood. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Few studies have provided information on the prevalence of vertebral fractures (VFs) and their risk factors in hemodialysis patients. A multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study was carried out to assess the prevalence of VFs and vascular calcifications (VCs) in 387 hemodialysis patients (mean age 64.2 ± 14.1 years, 63 % males) and in a control group of 51 osteoporotic subjects. Biochemical tests included 25(OH) vitamin D, bone Gla protein (total and undercarboxylated), and total matrix Gla protein. Vertebral quantitative morphometry was carried out centrally for the detection of VF, defined as reduction by ≥20 % of one of the vertebral body dimensions. In the same radiograph, aortic and iliac VC scores were calculated. Prevalence of VF was 55.3 % in hemodialysis patients and 51.0 % in the control group. Multivariate analysis disclosed that male gender (59.8 vs. 47.6 %, p = 0.02; OR = 1.78, 95 % CI 1.15-2.75) and age (mean ± SD 66.7 ± 13.1 vs. 61.0 ± 14.7 years, p < 0.001; OR = 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05) were significantly associated with VF. The prevalence of aortic VC was significantly higher in hemodialysis patients than in controls (80.6 vs. 68.4 %, p = 0.001). The factors with the strongest association with VC, apart from atrial fibrillation, were serum 25(OH)vitamin D levels below 29 ng/mL for aortic VC (OR = 1.85, 95 % CI 1.04-3.29) and VF both for aortic (OR = 1.77, 95 % CI 1.00-3.14) and iliac (OR = 1.96, 95 % CI 1.27-3.04) VC. In conclusion, the prevalence of VF, especially in males, and VC, in both genders, is high in hemodialysis patients. VF is associated with VC. Vitamin D deficiency is also associated with VC. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate fractures in renal patients. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Nephrolithiasis (NL) is a common condition with a lifetime risk exceeding 6.3% in men and 4.1% in women in the USA. The prevalence of NL has increased in both genders and all ethnic groups recently, and is known to be associated with osteoporosis, fractures and increased prevalence of CV disease. VC (especially aortic calcification) is also common, and is both a marker and a cause of increased cardiovascular (CV) disease. Underlying both NL and VC there may well be a common factor : a lack of calcification inhibitors.We wanted to study the prevalence of VC, and examine VC-associated risk factors, in an NL population. To do this, we studied, for the first time, the severity of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) in a population with an extensive renal stone burden. Methods: 93 NL subjects who had undergone a percutaneous nephro-lithotomy in 2011 underwent a manual scoring assessment for AAC using CT KUB-derived abdominal aorta imaging to calculate total AAC load.We gathered data on age, gender, GFR, stone burden and stone type. The prevalence, severity and associations of AAC were then analysed. Results: 51/93 stone formers were male, the mean (+/-SD) age was 51.1±3.2 years and they had a mean eGFR of 80.28±6.13 ml/min/1.73m2. 68 patients were idiopathic stone formers (51.9±3.8 years), 8 had an anatomical cause (50.4±10.8 years) and 13 a metabolic cause (45.2±7.4 years), p=NS for all. 19.22±0.06% of the whole group's abdominal aortas was calcified, with a total AAC score of 4.19±1.83. In patients > 50 years of age there was significantly more AAC than in those < 50 (8.09±3.40 vs. 0.53 ±0.60, P<0.001). Age showed a positive correlation with severity (R2=0.1932, P<0.05), see figure 1, whereas eGFR failed to show any significant correlation (R2=0.0154, P=NS). VC was not more common nor more severe in bilateral vs. unilateral stone formers (16/36 vs. 30/57; (4.82±3.22 vs. 3.79±2.21, p=NS, both). The AAC score was significantly lower in metabolic vs idiopathic NL (idiopathic 4.37±2.19, anatomical 9.50±9.54, metabolic 1.09±1.23; p=0.013) but not for any other comparison. Conclusions: This type of study has not been undertaken previously.We found that VC was both common and severe in NL subjects. AAC severity scores showed a positive correlation with advancing age but other factors, including renal function, failed to show any convincing association. The lower AAC score in metabolic as opposed to the other stone forming groups is intriguing. Further studies are needed in larger populations examining promoters and inhibitors of calcification in both blood and urine to see if there are any further risk factors associated with VC in NL patients.

N2  - Cardiovascular calcification is currently viewed as an active disease process similar to embryonic bone formation. Cardiovascular calcification mainly affects the aortic valve and arteries and is associated with increased mortality risk. Aortic valve and arterial calcification share similar risk factors, including age, gender, diabetes, chronic renal disease, and smoking. However, the exact cellular and molecular mechanism of cardiovascular calcification is unknown. Late-stage cardiovascular calcification can be visualized with conventional imaging modalities such as echocardiography and computed tomography. However, these modalities are limited in their ability to detect the development of early calcification and the progression of calcification until advanced tissue mineralization is apparent. Due to the subsequent late diagnosis of cardiovascular calcification, treatment is usually comprised of invasive interventions such as surgery. The need to understand the process of calcification is therefore warranted and requires new imaging modalities which are able to visualize early cardiovascular calcification. This review focuses on the use of new imaging techniques to visualize novel concepts of cardiovascular calcification. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is characterized by vascular calcification, thrombosis, and intense inflammation. Association between statin use and CUA risk has not been investigated. Methods: This matched case control study included 62 adult maintenance hemodialysis patients with biopsy confirmed CUA diagnosed during the years 2002 to 2011 (cases). Controls (n = 124) were hospitalized maintenance hemodialysis patients without CUA (matched by gender and calendar month). Subjects were identified from a research registry. Logistic regression models were applied to compute odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CUA in statin users, and also to examine previously described CUA risk factors. Annual incidence of CUA per 100 hospitalized maintenance hemodialysis patients was calculated. Results: Mean age of cases was 58.3 years. Most were females (68%), and of Caucasian race (64%). Stain use was more common in controls than in cases (39 vs. 19%). Statin use was associated [FIGURE PRESENTED] with lower odds of CUA in unadjusted (0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.79), and adjusted (0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.88) analyses (Figure 1). Hypercalcemia (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.14-4.43), hypoalbuminemia (OR 5.73, 95% CI 2.79-11.77), calcitriol use (OR 5.69, 95% CI 1.02-31.77), and warfarin use (OR 4.30, 95% CI 1.57-11.74) were associated with higher CUA risk in adjusted analyses whereas selective VDAs were not (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.54-3.27). Possible rise in the CUA incidence was noted over the study period (r = 0.84, p = 0.002) (Figure 2). Conclusion: Statin use is associated with reduced CUA risk. Further large prospective data are needed to confirm these findings.

N2  - Objective: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is proposed as a cardiovascular risk marker in non-uremic subjects. However, little is known about its role in patients with higher cardiovascular risk profile such as chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between EAT and several cardiovascular surrogate markers (coronary artery calcification (CAC), arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis) in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Methods: A total of 191 prevalent hemodialysis patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. EAT and CAC scores (CACs) were determined by multi-slice computerized tomography, arterial stiffness by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT) by B-mode doppler ultrasonography. Results: Mean age was 59 ± 13 years and time on hemodialysis 75 ± 44 months. Twenty percent of the patients had diabetes. Mean EAT volume was 62.6 ± 26.8 cm3/m2. Mean CA-IMT and PWV values increased across the EAT tertiles. EAT was correlated with age, female gender, body mass index, albumin and lipid parameters. Additionally, CA-IMT and PWV values were positively correlated with EAT. EAT volume was significantly higher in patients with CACs >10 compared to the patients with CACs ≤10. Despite the univariate associations between EAT and cardiovascular surrogate markers, only age, body mass index and total cholesterol levels were associated with EAT in adjusted models. Conclusions: In prevalent hemodialysis patients, EAT is correlated with atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness and the presence of CAC. However, this correlation is not independent of other risk factors. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate risk factors for the incidence and progression of thoracic aorta calcification (TAC) Introduction: Vascular calcification independently predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) and computed tomography (CT) is a useful tool to evaluate and quantify TAC. Previous TAC progression reports were limited to dialysis and renal transplant patients, This is the first study to evaluate TAC progression in a large multi-ethnic cohort without clinically evident CVD at entry Methods: Non-contrast enhanced cardiac CT (EBCT or MSCT) were obtained in 5886 of the 6814 MESA participants (mean age 62 yrs; 48% male; 40% white, 27% African American (AA), 21% Hispanic, 12% Chinese. Baseline (BL) and follow up (FU) TAC scores were derived Results: 4308 (73%) subjects had no detectable BL TAC. Mean FU duration was 2.4±0.8 yrs, during which 12% developed TAC. The overall incidence rate was 4.8%/yr and was greater with age across gender and ethnic groups,TAC incidence was significantly lower in AA than whites. Regression analyses showed FU time, age, systolic BP, antihypertensives, and smoking were predictors of incident TAC. 1578 (27%) subjects had prevalent TAC at BL scan with a positive association between the averaged annual TAC change and BL age. While the overall median (25th , 75th %tiles) change was 32.9 (-1.4,112.2) Agatston units, 38% of study population showed an annual Agatston score progression change of 10-99 and AA showed the lowest median across all ethnic groups; 22.7 (-3,86.8). Regression analyses showed MSCT use, FU time, age, systolic BP, lipid-lowering medication, DM and current smoking were predictors of TAC progression (Tab1) Conclusion: In the MESA cohort, both TAC incidence and progression were significantly associated with traditional CV risk factors. AA had the lowest incidence and median change across ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings for coronary calcification. Further studies are needed to correlate progression with outcome data.

N2  - The best treatment for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients is kidney transplantation, but the renal transplant recipients still have a higher incidence of cardiovascular events compared with general population. Cardiovascular risk factors were imposed long before ESRD, as the majority of patients starting dialysis or kidney transplantation already have signs of advanced atherosclerosis. Artery calcification is an organized, regulated process similar to bone formation. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is found frequently in advanced atherosclerotic lesions and could be a useful marker of them. We evaluated the prevalence of CAC in 49 stable renal transplant recipients and in 48 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in stages 2-5 not requiring dialysis to assess risk factors associated with CAC. Computed tomography was used for CAC detection and quantification (CAC score). The prevalence of CAC was 43.8% in transplant recipients and 16.7% in CKD patients (p < 0.001). Transplant recipients with CAC were significantly older and had longer duration of CKD and/or dialysis than recipients without CAC. In contrast, the serum levels of fetuin A (an inhibitor of vascular calcification) and albumin were significantly lower in CKD patients with CAC than those without CAC. During the observation period (30 months), 30 patients, including 23 CKD patients, began dialysis, and 4 transplant recipients and 2 CKD patients died. Independent predictors of mortality were age, serum amyloid A and the CAC score. In conclusion, the examination and prevention of risk factors associated with atherosclerosis should be started at the beginning of renal failure.

Background: VC and cardiovascular disease are highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 5-5D. However, most are elderly, with CKD often caused by vascular pathology. Patients undergoing transplantation are younger than other dialysis patients and their CKD is infrequently vascular in origin. The prevalence and epidemiology of VC in these patients has not previously been characterised. Methods: 607 consecutive patients receiving kidney or SPK transplants from 2000-2012 were assessed with laboratory values immediately before transplantation and lateral abdominal x-ray for VC plus bone mineral density (BMD) within 4 weeks. Calcification scores were determined using a validated 24-point scale. Results: The median patient age was 42 years (16-71), 59% were male and diabetes was present in 40%. Median time on dialysis was 18 months (0-402), 67% were undergoing kidney and 33% SPK transplantation. X-rays were available for 475 (78%). The VC score was ≥1 in 228 (48%) with the median score 5 (1-24). By stepwise regression analysis, predictors of VC were age (p < 0.001), time on dialysis (p < 0.004) and serum phosphate (p = 0.001). Smoking was associated with VC only in bivariate analysis. VC was not associated with gender, transplant type, presence of diabetes or cardiovascular disease, serum calcium, PTH, ALP, 25-hydroxyvitamin D or calcitriol. There was no inverse relationship to BMD at the hip, spine, forearm or wrist. Conclusions: Vascular calcification is common in younger, fitter kidney and SPK recipients. Nevertheless, similar to older patients, VC is associated with age, dialysis vintage and phosphate levels.

N2  - Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent data implicate disordered bone and mineral metabolism, including changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF- 23), and fetuin A, as novel risk factors for arterial calcification. The potential role of calcitonin, another hormonal regulator of mineral and bone metabolism, has not been studied in detail. Materials and methods We investigated the link between serum calcitonin and the total burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) using the validated Gensini score, in a cross-sectional study of 88 patients with estimated GFR (eGFR) between 46 and 87 ml/ min/1.73 m2 who underwent coronary angiography. We evaluated the associations between serum calcitonin, minerals (calcium, phosphate), calcium 9 phosphate product, and other factors that regulate mineral metabolism (intact PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D, FGF-23, and fetuin A) and the severity of CAD. Results: The mean serum calcitonin was 11.5 ± 7.8 pg/ml. In univariate analysis, the Gensini CAD severity score correlated significantly with male gender, eGFR, and serum levels of 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF-23, fetuin A, and calcitonin (R = 0.474, P = 0.001 for the latter). In multivariate analysis adjusted for calcium, phosphate, 25-OH-vitamin D, iPTH, FGF 23, fetuin A, and calcitonin, only calcitonin (b = 0.20; P = 0.03), FGF-23, fetuin A, and 25-OH-vitamin D emerged as independent predictors of Gensini score. In the second step, we adjusted for the presence of traditional risk factors, proteinuria, and GFR. After these adjustments, the FGF-23 and fetuin A remained statistically significant predictors of the Gensini score, while calcitonin did not. Conclusions Our study suggests that, in addition to other well-known components of mineral metabolism, increased calcitonin levels are associated with greater severity of CAD. However, this relation was not independent of traditional and nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors. Longitudinal studies in larger populations including patients with more advanced CKD are needed. © Springer Science+Business Media, B.V. 2011.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcification and reduced bone density are prevalent in chronic kidney disease and linked to increased cardiovascular risk. The mechanism is unknown. We assessed the relationship between vascular calcification, femoral bone density and left ventricular mass in patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease in a cross-sectional observational study. Methodology and Principal Findings: A total of 120 patients were recruited (54% male, mean age 55±14 years, mean glomerular filtration rate 50±13 ml/min/1.73 m2). Abdominal aortic calcification was assessed using lateral lumbar spine radiography and was present in 48%. Mean femoral Z-score measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was 0.60±1.06. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine left ventricular mass. One patient had left ventricular hypertrophy. Subjects with aortic calcification had higher left ventricular mass compared to those without (56±16 vs. 48±12 g/m2, P = 0.002), as did patients with femoral Z-scores below zero (56±15 vs. 49±13 g/m2, P = 0.01). In univariate analysis presence of aortic calcification correlated with left ventricular mass (r = 0.32, P = 0.001); mean femoral Z-score inversely correlated with left ventricular mass (r = -0.28, P = 0.004). In a multivariate regression model that included presence of aortic calcification, mean femoral Z-score, gender and 24-hour systolic blood pressure, 46% of the variability in left ventricular mass was explained (P<0.001). Conclusions: In patients with stage 3 non-diabetic chronic kidney disease, lower mean femoral Z-score and presence of aortic calcification are independently associated with increased left ventricular mass. Further research exploring the pathophysiology that underlies these relationships is warranted. © 2012 Chue et al.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are extensively used for the chronic treatment of common gastrointestinal disorders. Chronic PPI use is associated with increased risk of fractures. The primary endpoint was the extent of aortic and iliac calcifications, in relation to PPI use. Methods: Multicenter, cross-sectional study in hemodialysis patients, 18 hospital based dialysis centers. We included 387 hemodialysis patients (76.2% on chronic PPI treatment). Vascular (aortic and/or iliac) Calcification (VC) assessments were centralized. Witteman's method (Lancet, 1994) was used for blinded assessments in duplicate. VC were quantified by measuring the length of calcific deposits along the anterior and posterior wall of the aorta (mild 0.1-5 cm, moderate 5.1-10 cm and severe >10 cm). They also evaluated the presence or absence of calcifications of the iliac arteries in the same radiograph (mild 0.1-3 cm, moderate 3.1-5 cm and severe > 5 cm). Any differences were resolved by consensus. Results: Bone markers were: Ca 9.15±0.68 mg/dl, P 4.8± 1.28 mg/dl, median ALP 83 U/L, median PTH 244, median 25(OH)D 28.9 nmol/L, median BGP 175 mcg/L, median ucBGP 10.95 mcg/L, median MGP 19.36 nmol/L, median PCR 1.6 mg/L. Prevalence of VC was 80.6% (mild 20.1%, moderate 30.8%, severe 29.7%) in the aorta and 55,1% in the iliac arteries. We found Arterial calcifications were significantly more common in the PPI group : 57.0% vs. 41.3% (p=0.0086). Also the rates of aortic and iliac calcifications considered separately were higher (+12.2% p=0.0254 and +13.6% p=0.0211, respectively). The proportions of patients suffering from angina and atrial fibrillation were significantly higher in the PPI group (+11.7% p=0.0083 and +8.8% p=0.0306, respectively). Severe aortic calcifications, as well as moderate and severe iliac calcifications, appeared to be significantly related to age, male gender, hypertriglyceridemia, warfarin treatment and also to PPI treatment, the latter with an odd ratio of 2.15-2.66 depending on calcification site. Conclusions: In hemodialysis patients chronic treatment with PPIs is associated with vascular calcification, a known risk factor for cardiovascular events and mortality in hemodialysis patients, and for cardiovascular events in non renal elderly subjects. Additional studies are warranted to explore the association among chronic PPI treatment, vascular calcifications and cardiovascular events.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Vascular calcifications, due to traditional and non-traditional risk factors (including mineral metabolism abnormalities), are highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Although lumbar aortic calcification score (ACS) provides a simple and inexpensive method to evaluate vascular disease, little is known about its determinants in pre-dialysis stages of CKD. Thus, we aimed to assess ACS relationships with certain uremia-related factors in adults with or without CKD. Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional, single-center study on 106 stable patients with non-dialysis CKD (60% male; 62 [51-72] years, 55% over 60 year-old; 49% - stage 3, 35% - stage 4, 16%- stage 5) and 34 age- and gender-matched patients without CKD (47% male; 59 [46-66] years, 50% over 60 year-old) was conducted. Only 4% of CKD subjects were treated with calcium salt and none with vitamin D derivatives. Medical history and blood pressure measurement were obtained. Abdominal aortic calcification score was evaluated according to Kauppila on a plain lateral lumbar X-ray. Automatic waveform analyzer measurements and carotid artery ultrasonography were performed to assess the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI), ankle-brachial index (ABI) and carotid intimae-media thickness (IMT). Some nontraditional risk factors (serum calcium - tCa, phosphate - PO4, intact parathyroid hormone - iPTH, 25 hydroxy-vitamin D - 25OHD, C-reactive protein - CRP) and serum albumin (sAlb) were measured. Results: The proportions of patients with diabetes mellitus, obesity, and active smoking were similar (26% in CKD group vs. 18% in controls, p=0.35, 32% vs. 26%, p=0.54, and 13% vs. 18%, p=0.71, respectively). Higher ACS was found in CKD (1 [0-5.8]) vs. non-CKD patients (0 [0-1]), p=0.003, especially in those with stages 4 (4 [1-7]), p<0.001, and 5 (7 [3-11]), p<0.001. Univariate linear regression showed strong positive associations of ACS with CKD duration (rs=0.32, p<0.001), PO4 (r=0.26, p=0.002), iPTH (rs=0.35, p<0.001), and CRP (rs=0.32, p<0.001), while glomerular filtration rate (GFR, rs=-0.50, p<0.001), sAlb (r=-0.18, p=0.04) and gender (r=-0.18, p=0.04) were inversely associated. No relationships with age, 25OHD, IMT, and indices of arterial stiffness (CAVI, ABI) were found. However, in a model of multiple linear regression that accounts for 30% of ACS variation ( p<0.001), only GFR (t ratio=2.55, p=0.01), tCa (t ratio=2.57, p=0.01) and male gender (t ratio=2.15, p=0.04) were independent predictors of the aortic calcification score. Conclusions: Abdominal aortic calcifications are more prevalent in non-dialysis CKD patients as compared to their Control counterparts matched for the main traditional cardiovascular risk factors. In adults with and without CKD, lower GFR and higher serum calcium are determinants of ACS. Thus, the decline of kidney function below 30mL/min/1.73 m2 appears as an independent risk factor for vascular calcifications. Among mineral metabolism parameters, only calcium burden seems involved.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death among end stage renal disease patients. Gender and older age belong to its classical risk factors. OPG/RANK/sRANKL (Osteoprotegerin/ Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor ?B/ soluble Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor ?B Ligand) axis is a system connecting bone and vascular remodeling. OPG is a well-known bone protector which additionally prevents vascular calcifications. However, elevated OPG levels predict cardiovascular events in HD patients. OPG/sRANKL ratio is a determinant of skeletal integrity apparently also vascular stability. Methods: We aimed to evaluate the concentrations of OPG, sRANKL and OPG/ sRANKL ratio in 21 chronically hemodialysed (HD) patients (10 females) and 16 healthy volunteers (10 females) and to relate them to gender, age as well as other clinical and laboratory parameters. All examined women were postmenopausal (>50 yrs.). Results: Overall OPG and OPG/sRANKL ratio were significantly higher in HD patients than controls (p<10-5) whereas sRANKL was similar in both groups. Adjusted to gender, in controls OPG were higher in women (p=0.03), whereas sRANKL did not differ between man and female. In HD group OPG and sRANKL were higher in women (p=0.04, p=0.02 respectively) whereas OPG/sRANKL ratio was similar in both gender. Female patients compared to healthy women revealed 44% higher OPG concentration (p<10-4) and 46% higher OPG/sRANKL ratio (p=0.004). Comparison of male patients and controls revealed 39% higher level of OPG (p= 0.001) and 25% higher OPG/ sRANKL ratio (p=0.003) in HD group. (Table) In controls and HD females patients there was no straight correlation between OPG and age. Interestingly, OPG and OPG/ sRANKL ratio positively correlated with age in male HD patients (p=0.001 and p=0.011, respectively). Contrary, the association between OPG/sRANKL ratio and age was negative in HD women. In female HD group OPG and OPG/sRANKL ratio were independently and inversely predicted by total cholesterol level. In male HD group the main predictor of OPG and OPG/sRANKL ratio was age. Conclusions: Higher OPG levels in HD women, comparing to age-matched HD men has not been described so far. Although its significance is unknown, it may indicate the difference in regulatory mechanisms of OPG/RANKL axis in men and women. A negative association between age and OPG/sRANKL ratio in female HD group warrants in-depth study and thorough understanding of this complex mechanism. (Table Presented) .

N2  - Introduction and Aims: In addition to bleeding, other risks have been associated with the use of warfarin, including an increased susceptibility to vascular calcifications and fractures caused by a reduction in the levels of vitamin K dependent carboxylated enzymes, matrix Gla-protein (MGP) and bone Gla-protein or osteocalcin (BGP), respectively. Indeed, warfarin acts as a vitamin K antagonist reducing Vitamin K levels. The Aim was to evaluate in hemodialysis patients the prevalence of Vertebral Fractures (VF), Vascular Calcifications (VC) and mortality in relation to warfarin use. Methods: Multicenter, cross-sectional study in patients treated in 18 hospital based dialysis centers. We included 387 hemodialysis patients (11.9% on warfarin treatment). We evaluated VF with a computerized analysis, of scanned latero-lateral vertebral X-rays (T4 to L5). Reduction of >20% of vertebral body height was considered a VF, while reductions between 15% and 20% were considered borderline fractures (BF). VF severity was estimated as mild, moderate or severe (reduction: 20- 25%, 25-40% or >40%, respectively). VC assessments were centralized. Witteman's method (Lancet, 1994) was used for blinded assessments in duplicate. VC were quantified by measuring the length of calcific deposits along the anterior and posterior wall of the aorta (mild 0.1-5 cm, moderate 5.1-10 cm and severe > 10 cm). They also evaluated the presence or absence of calcifications of the iliac arteries in the same radiograph (mild 0.1-3 cm, moderate 3.1-5 cm and severe > 5 cm). Any differences were resolved by consensus. Follow up 2.7±0.5 years. Results: Bone markers were: Ca 9.15±0.68 mg/dl, P 4.8± 1.28 mg/dl, median ALP 83 U/L, median PTH 244, median BGP 175 mcg/L, median ucBGP 10.95 mcg/L, median MGP 19.36 nmol/L, median PCR 1.6 mg/L. We found that 55% of patients had VF and 30.9% of patients had BF. Prevalence of VC was 80.6% (mild 20.1%, moderate 30.8%, severe 29.7%) in the aorta and55,1% in the iliac arteries. VF were significantly associated with warfarin use in males (6.1% vs 14.4%, p=0.044) but not in females. Severe aortic calcifications appeared to be significantly related to age, male gender, hypertriglyceridemia, PPI treatment and also to warfarin treatment, the latter with an odd ratio of 3.04 (95% CI 1.52-6.07, p=0.0016). Also, severe iliac calcifications were significantly related to age, PTH and warfarin, the latter with an odd ratio of 3.30 (95% CI1.59-6.85, p=0.0013). Furthermore, during follow-up (2.7 ±0.5 years) overall mortality was19.9% (on 387 total patients), but significantly increased in warfarin treated patients (37%; Log rank test p=0.0009). Conclusions: Hemodialysis patients treated with warfarin show a higher prevalence VF (in men), VC and increased mortality. Additional studies are warranted to explore the association among warfarin treatment, VF, VC and mortality.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) has been reported to be a strong predictor of survival in incident hemodialysis patients. Vascular Calcification is a well known marker of cardiovascular events and death in hemodialysis patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness of the CCI as a predictor of vascular calcification. Methods: We prospectively followed for 12 months all patients of a dialysis unit on treatment for more than 3 months by the 31st of January 2009. The CCI score was calculated from ICD-9 CM codes attributed to comorbidity assessment obtained for each patient at the start of dialysis. Patients were classified to 2 CCI score categories according to the median of the score (CCI1<4 ; CCI2 = 4). Vascular calcification was assessed by the Adragão score from the X-ray films obtained through 2009. Laboratory parameters regarding inflammation, nutritional status, anemia and data on intradialytic and extradialytic therapy were also recorded. Results: We followed 169 patients (63.3% males), with a mean age of 61,87±16.32 years on hemodialysis for 73,26±112,14 months. CCI1 patients showed longer hemodialysis time (197,27±64,70 Vs 568,34±44,77 months; p<0,05), a better Adragão Score (1,63±1,88 Vs. 2,96±2,43; p<0,05), higher Pi (4,76±1,53 Vs 4,04±0,97; p<0,05). No differences were found between the two groups regarding CRP, albumin, CaxPi, PTH, Vitamin D therapy and Kt/V. In a logistic regression model, after adjustment for CRP, Gender, Pi and PTH, patients with CCI2 at baseline presented a 2,8-fold risk for development of vascular calcification (p=0,018). In the same model hemodialysis vintage, as expected, also emerged as a predictor of vascular calcification (p = 0,009). Finally, a vascular calcification score = 2 represented a 1.3-fold risk for cardiovascular events (p=0,012). Conclusions: In our population, a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index at the beginning of hemodialysis independently predicted vascular calcification and consequently adverse cardiovascular events.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in hemodialysis patients with a cardiovascular risk 10 to 20 times higher than in general population. It is known that accelerated atherosclerosis and vascular calcifications contribute to the risk excess. This study aimes to evaluate the degree of plaque burden and the correlation between carotid intima- media thickness (cIMT) assessed by ultrasonography with both traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients. Methods: We enrolled 75 patients with end stage renal failure (35F and 40M) aged 56.3 +/- 14.1 years being on maintenance hemodialysis for 42.1 +/- 58.0 months. Carotid arteries were evaluated at 0.5cm, 1cm, 1.5cm and 2cm distance from bifurcation on both sides. We considered the mean cIMT as the average of the 8 determinations. Biochemical tests where performed before the midweek hemodialysis session for Hb, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Ca, P, iPTH, CRP and uric acid levels. Demographic data, blood pressure, BMI, smoking, history of diabetes mellitus and duration of hemodialysis period were investigated as well. Results: During the 18 months follow-up period 6 patients died (8%), the majority from cardiovascular disease (66.7%). One third (37.3%) of the patients had carotid atheroma plaques, most of which were calcified (19 out of 28). The mean cIMT was 9.5 +/- 4mm and it associated with age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and CRP. Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between calcified atheroma plaque and dyslipidemia, male gender, duration of hemodialysis, hyperuricemia, Ca x P> 55 and iPTH. The study of the risk factors showed that cIMT, CRP, P, CaXP and iPTH were death predictors in our population. Conclusions: Our findings suggest cIMT could be useful to identify vulnerable subjects but only combined analysis of traditional and uremia related risk factors can identify the cardiovascular risk profile in this population. Further study is recommended to evaluate the prediction impact of each risk factor in patients with different stages of kidney disease compared to control subjects.

N2  - Objective(s): Haemodialysis (HD) patients display a higher risk for fracture as compared to the general population and this risk has been associated with low BMD score. We aimed at assessing the BMD evolution and the associated factors in a stable HD population in one centre. Material & Methods: Between 2006 (T0) and 2009 (T3), 2 BMDs were performed recording the results of the femoral neck (FN) and the ultradistal radius (UDR) bone density. Patients with a decreased BMD (BMD-) were compared to patients with stable or increased BMD scores (BMD+). A radiological vascular calcification (VC) score (0-3) was applied. Results: 77/95 patients at T0 were still dialyzing in our centre at T3 and were recorded for analysis. Mean age was 67±10 (30-80) years, 50%were of female gender, 33%were diabetic, in dialysis since 75±82 months with a 3x5 to 3x8 h schedule. Mean FN BMD decreased of -8.5±11% (0.7±0.1 to 0.63±0.1 g/cm2), UDR BMD decreased of -9.4±14% (0.49±0.1 to 0.43±0.1 g/cm2). As compared to BMD+, FN-BMD- patients (64%) had more frequently peripheral artery disease (27 vs. 7%), more severe VC score (1.57±2 vs. 1.17±2), a decrease of serum FGF-23 (-2800 vs. +3800 RU/ml), an increased serum PTH (+120±250 vs. +28±120%) and were taking more frequently sevelamer (50 vs. 26%). Patients with UDR-BMD- (72%) have an increased serum PTH (+108± 250 vs. -8±44%), more severe VC score (1.55±2 vs. 1.1±2) and were less frequently treated with CaCO3 (2 vs.15%). Conclusion(s): The decrease of BMD is frequently observed in HD patients after 3 years. We failed to found any relationship with age, gender and BMI but mostly with vascular calcification and increased PTH possibly relatedwith less calcium intake.

N2  - Vascular calcification is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This calcification starts to develop in the early stages of chronic kidney disease and is present in over 50% of patients at the time of dialysis commencement. The aim of these study is to assess the degree of calcifications that may involve the main arteries (carotid, aorta, coronary) in Egyptian patients with chronic kidney disease and whether there is significant correlation between the age, Parathormone hormone (PTH), serum calcium, serum phosphorus, Ca x Ph product, cholesterol and triglycerides and these calcifications. The study was conducted on 81 individuals classified into three groups: 41 patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease on regular hemodialysis for at least one year (group A), 30 CKD patients in predialysis period (group B) and 10 persons of normal individuals as control group (group C). All patients and control were subjected to full medical history, full clinical examination and laboratory investigations including serum calcium, Ph, (intact Parathormone hormone iPTH, Ca x Ph product, total cholesterol and triglycerides. Also radiological investigations include CT abdomen (computed tomography of the abdomen) to assess the degree of calcification of abdominal aorta, Duplex study on the main common carotid arteries and echocardiography to assess the degree of aortic valve calcification if present were done. The results of abdominal aorta calcification (2.12± 1.44 vs 0.43± 0.63vs 0.10± 0.32) showed a highly statistical significant difference between group A and B& A and C (P< 0.0001) while being significant between B and C (P<0.05), common carotid artery calcification (0.73± 1.00 vs 0.57± 0.73vs 0.20± 0.42) showed a significant difference only between group A and C (p<0.05), while aortic valve calcification (0.46± 0.60vs 0.23± 0.43vs 0) showed a high significant difference between A and C& B and C. In dialysis patients abdominal aorta calcification &common carotid artery calcification and aortic valve calcification showed a significant correlation with iPTH, Cholesterol, Triglycerides (p<0.01). In predialysis patients, common carotid artery calcification &abdominal aorta calcification and aortic valve calcification showed significant correlation with age (p<0.01). This study suggested increased incidence of vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease Egyptian patients in comparison to the same age and gender of the healthy individuals and vascular calcification is present in CKD patients even in stages before the start of renal replacement therapy. Vascular calcification in CKD patients is a very complicated multifactorial process which needs further studies. © IDOSI Publications, 2011.

N2  - Introduction Vascular calcifications (VCs) and renal osteodystrophy (ROD) are frequently seen together and represent the major causes of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Some studies suggest a pathogenic link between them, but there is no consensus as yet regarding this issue. The main objective of our study was to establish whether there is any relation between VCs and ROD in our HD patients. We evaluated the prevalence of VCs and ROD and the relationship between VCs and some clinical and biochemical characteristics of HD patients. Methods We examined radiological signs of VCs and RODon hands and pelvis bone radiographs in 81 chronic HD patients, and we calculated a VC score on this basis. Results We found a significant relation between radiological signs of ROD and those of VC (P = 0.019). The patients with ROD had a higher mean VC score (P = 0.02). By linear regression, the VC score correlated directly with serum calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and CaxP product and inversely with serum albumin. The logistic regression model revealed that ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium salts were predictive of VCs development. There were no associations between VCs and age, HD vintage, diabetes, dialysate Ca concentration, vitamin D treatment, spKt/V, URR and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Conclusion There seems to be a pathogenetic link between bone and artery diseases in chronic HD patients. Both VCs and ROD have a high prevalence. ROD, male gender and treatment with calcium salts are risk factors for VCs. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

N2  - Background and objectives Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a cytokine that regulates bone resorption, has been implicated in the process of vascular calcification and stiffness. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Serum OPG was measured in 351 participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from one site of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study. Cortical bone mineral content (BMC) was measured by quantitative computed tomography in the tibia. Multivariable linear regression was used to test the association between serum OPG and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, measures of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and pulse wave velocity. Results Higher serum OPG levels were associated with older age, female gender, greater systolic BP, lower estimated GFR, and lower serum albumin. OPG was not associated with measures of abnormal bone or mineral metabolism including serum phosphorus, albumin-corrected serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, or cortical BMC. Among 226 participants with concurrent aortic pulse wave velocity measurements, increasing tertiles of serum OPG were associated with higher aortic pulse wave velocity after adjustment for demographics, traditional vascular risk factors, and nontraditional risk factors such as estimated GFR, albuminuria, serum phosphate, corrected serum calcium, presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, serum albumin, and C-reactive protein or after additional adjustment for cortical BMC in a subset (n=161). Conclusions These data support a strong relationship between serum OPG and arterial stiffness independent of many potential confounders including traditional cardiovascular risk factors, abnormal bone and mineral metabolism, and inflammation. © 2011 by the American Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Vascular calcification is accelerated during dialysis and is known to be an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Progression of aortic arch calcification (AoAC) can be simply estimated with an AoAC score (AoACS) using plain chest radiography. The objective of this study was to evaluate risk factors for AoAC progression. The enrolled subjects were 125 newly treated hemodialysis patients and 59 peritoneal dialysis patients. In the patients who had undergone chest radiography before initial dialysis therapy and every year, we estimated AoACS and then divided the patients into two groups based on the presence or absence of AoAC progression. We also compared the baseline clinical and biochemical profiles in the two groups. Eighty-five (46.2%) were men (mean age, 58.6±12.7 years). Seventy-six patients (41.3%) had AoAC before initial dialysis, with a mean AoACS of 13.0±20.4%. The mean duration of follow-up was 2.7±1.0 years. Half of the patients (50%) had progressive AoAC. Age >65 years (p=0.003), dialysis duration (p=0.004), diabetes (p=0.015), and the presence of AoAC at baseline (p=0.001) were related to AoAC progression. No significant association was found between AoAC progression and the baseline clinical parameters, including gender, obesity, hypertension, and dialysis modality. In a multivariate analysis, dialysis duration (p=0.003) and the presence of AoAC at baseline (p<0.001) were independent risk factors for AoAC progression in patients undergoing dialysis. The duration of dialysis and the presence of AoAC before initial dialysis were significantly related to the progression of AoAC in these patients. The results suggest that patients should be carefully managed from the predialysis stage to prevent AoAC progression and to reduce cardiovascular morbidity. © 2011 The Authors; Hemodialysis International © 2011 International Society for Hemodialysis.

N2  - Background and objectives: End-stage renal disease is linked to alterations in thyroid hormone levels and/or metabolism, resulting in a high prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism and low triiodothyronine (T3) levels. These alterations are involved in endothelial damage, cardiac abnormalities, and inflammation, but the exact mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum free-T3 (fT3) and carotid artery atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, and vascular calcification in prevalent patients on conventional hemodialysis. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: 137 patients were included. Thyroid-hormone levels were determined by chemiluminescent immunoassay, carotid artery-intima media thickness (CA-IMT) by Doppler ultrasonography, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (c-f PWV), and augmentation index by Sphygmocor device, and coronary artery calcification (CAC) scores by multi-slice computerized tomography. Results: Mean fT3 level was 3.70±1.23 pmol/L. Across decreasing fT3 tertiles, c-f PWV and CA-IMT values were incrementally higher, whereas CACs were not different. In adjusted ordinal logistic regression analysis, fT3 level (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 0.97), age, and interdialytic weight gain were significantly associated with CA-IMT. fT3 level was associated with c-f PWV in nondiabetics but not in diabetics. In nondiabetics (n±113), c-f PWV was positively associated with age and systolic BP but negatively with fT3 levels (odds ratio±0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.83). Conclusions: fT3 levels are inversely associated with carotid atherosclerosis but not with CAC in hemodialysis patients. Also, fT3 levels are inversely associated with surrogates of arterial stiffness in nondiabetics. © 2011 by the American Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Background and Purpose: Extracranial superficial temporal artery (STA) calcification is an unusual finding seen in patients with chronic kidney disease and has unknown ramifications with respect to intracranial ischemic disease. We sought to determine the association between the risk factors for vascular calcification and this rare phenomenon, in patients with chronic renal failure, and to assess the coexistence of cerebral ischemia. Materials and Methods: Medical records and laboratory data on risk factors for vascular calcification were retrospectively retrieved for 453 patients with a discharge diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). CT head examinations were reviewed to identify and associate STA calcification with 1) risk factors for the vascular calcification, 2) intracranial artery calcification, and 3) cerebral ischemia (white matter and/or cortical ischemic changes). Results: STA calcification was present in 9.9% (45/453) of the studied cohort. The prevalence of cerebral ischemia was 24.4% (11/45) in patients with STA calcification and 9.3% (38/408) in patients without it. Diabetes mellitus (OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.059-6.208; P=0.037) was independently associated with the risk of STA calcification. The risk of cerebral ischemia, however, was not related to STA calcification (P=0.221). Conclusion: The presence of diabetes mellitus is important in describing the risk of STA calcification in patients with ESRD, whereas age, gender, hypertension, serum calcium, serum phosphate, or serum hemoglobin levels are not. The risk of cerebral ischemia is not related to STA calcification but has the strongest association with diabetes mellitus.

N2  - Background. The purpose of this study was to report the evolution of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in subjects with chronic kidney disease Stages 3 and 4 comparing those with and without diabetes. We previously reported prevalence in the same population.Methods. CAC was measured using multi-slice computer tomography. We prospectively followed up 103 patients for 2 years, 49 with diabetes and 54 without diabetes. Demographic, routine biochemistry, calcification inhibitors and bone mineral density data were collected and analysed. Evolution of CAC was defined as those with a difference of ≥2.5 U between baseline and final square root CAC scores.Results. There were more progressors in the group with diabetes, 24 compared to 12 in the group without diabetes (P=0.004). When diabetes was present, CAC progressed equally in men and women. Risk factors for evolution of CAC included age, baseline CAC score and serum phosphate levels. Baseline CAC score, phosphate and body mass index were independent predictors for the increase of CAC score during the study period. Severity of CAC was greater in the diabetes group (median CAC score at baseline in the group with diabetes 154 increased to 258 2 years later, P<0.001).Conclusions. Evolution of CAC is greater in older patients and those with diabetes, where the gender advantage of being female is lost. Serum phosphate level, despite being within the normal range and virtually no use of phosphate binders, was also a risk factor. Further studies are required to determine the levels of serum phosphate required to minimize cardiovascular risk. © 2011 The Author Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcifications are highly prevalent in patients maintained on chronic hemodialysis. They have been linked to numerous risk factors and have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the prevalence of vascular calcifications among dialysis patients in our tertiary care center and to identify the associated risk factors. METHODS: In the current study, we reviewed the charts of 43 patients undergoing hemodialysis at our center. We estimated the prevalence of vascular calcifications among dialysis patients using plain X-ray of the hand as the screening tool. We compared patient's characteristics and tried to identify possible risk factors, with a special emphasis on the subgroup of patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Vascular calcifications were prevalent among half of the patients on hemodialysis. Duration of dialysis (p = 0.02), diabetes (p < 0.001), and hypertension (p = 0.01) were highly associated with vascular calcifications. No association was found between vascular calcifications and age, gender, calcium-based phosphate binders, vitamin D supplementation, smoking, and lipid control. In multivariate analyses, diabetes and duration of dialysis were the only independent predictors of vascular calcifications and diabetics developed vascular calcifications earlier than nondiabetics (31 months vs 69 months]. CONCLUSION: Vascular calcifications are moderately prevalent among patients undergoing hemodialysis at our center, and were found to be strongly correlated with diabetes and duration of dialysis. A larger, multicenter, prospective study should be conducted at national level, in order to confirm the findings of this study and to identify further modifiable risk factors, to decrease the incidence of vascular calcifications and the incurring cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in our population.

N2  - Summary: A high circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) level may be a risk factor for vascular calcification and mortality in hemodialysis patients. OPG and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured at baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term (>3 years) Japanese hemodialysis patients who were prospectively followed for 6 years. In long-term normoalbuminemic Japanese hemodialysis patients, OPG levels were strongly linked with both arterial stiffness and worse outcome. Introduction: A high circulating OPG level is reported to be a risk factor for vascular calcification and mortality in Western chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients but it is not known if this is true for Japanese CKD patients, where a different risk profile may operate. Methods: OPG and PWV were measured at baseline in 151 normoalbuminemic, long-term (<3 years) Japanese hemodialysis patients (median age 62 years) who were prospectively followed for 6 years. Results: OPG levels were associated in multivariate analysis with age, dialysis vintage, history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and parathyroid hormone levels. C-reactive protein levels did not correlate with OPG. Patients with clinical history of CVD had significantly higher OPG levels and OPG levels were positively correlated to PWV, an index of arterial stiffness. These associations were independent of age, sex, dialysis vintage, and diabetes. During the follow-up period, 40 deaths, including 25 cardiovascular deaths, were recorded. In crude analysis, each unit of increase in OPG was associated with increased all-cause (hazard ratios 1.14, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.20) and CVD mortality (1.14 [1.07-1.21]), which persisted after adjustment for age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes, and baseline CVD (1.12 [1.05-1.19] and 1.11 [1.02-1.19], all-cause and CVD mortality, respectively). Conclusions: In long-term normoalbuminemic Japanese hemodialysis patients, with low prevalence of inflammation, OPG levels were strongly linked with both arterial stiffness and worse outcome. © International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation 2010.

N2  - Vascular calcification (VC) is highly prevalent in CKD and leads to increased vascular stiffness and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors include abnormal bone turnover and/or dysregulation of the calcification inhibitors, although their relative contribution remains unclear. We investigated the association between bone turnover, the calcification inhibitors (matrix gla protein; MGP and Fetuin-A), and the phosphate regulating hormone; fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD patients. One hundred and forty-five patients with CKD stages 1-4 (74 M, 71 F) aged (mean [SD]) 53 [14] years were studied. Bone turnover markers (bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP)) and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 were determined. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), forearm (FARM) and total hip (TH). Arterial stiffness was assessed by contour analysis of digital volume pulse (SIDVP). There was a significant positive correlation between TRACP:BALP ratio and SIDVP ( r=0.19, p=0.023). Following multi-linear regression analysis, significant associations were seen between serum BALP (p=0.037), TRACP (p=0.009) and TRACP:BALP ratio (p=0.001) and SIDVP independently of traditional CVD risk factors. No significant relationship between SIDVP and MGP, Fetuin-A and FGF-23 was observed. A significant negative correlation was seen between BMD at the FARM and SIDVP in CKD stage 4 (r=-0.35, p=0.024). The association remained significant following correction for age, gender and cardiovascular risk factors (p=0.029). Our data suggest a link between imbalances in bone turnover and arterial stiffness in pre-dialysis CKD. Longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the clinical usefulness of these bone turnover markers as predictors of CVD in CKD. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Introduction: A very low parathyroid hormone (PTH) level (VLPL) is associated with an increased risk of adynamic bone disease, vascular calcification, and mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the study was to assess the frequency, the associated factors, and the prognosis of non-surgical VLPL in a cohort of prevalent HD patients. Methods: In July 2005, a cross-sectional study was performed on the French ARNOS cohort in 1,348 prevalent HD patients from 24 dialysis centres in the Rhône-Alpes area. Patients with a baseline intact PTH level <50 pg/ml (VLPL, Group 1) and ≥50 pg/ml (Group 2) were compared and a 42-month survival analysis was performed. Patients with prevalent or incident parathyroidectomy were excluded. Results: We studied 1,138 prevalent HD patients. As compared to patients of Group 2 (n = 1,019), patients with VLPL (Group 1, n = 119) had lower serum albumin levels (34.5 ± 5 vs. 36.4 ± 5 g/l, p < 0.0001), less protein intake (nPCR 0.99 ± 0.28 vs. 1.1 ± 0.28 g/kg/day, p = 0.01), higher calcaemia (2.30 ± 0.2 vs. 2.26 ± 0.2 mmol/l, p = 0.01) and were more frequently treated with calcium carbonate (67 vs. 54%, p < 0.001). Patients with VLPL had a higher mortality rate (HR: 1.4 (1.07-1.8), p = 0.006) after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes, and dialysis vintage. The odds ratios of mortality for patients with VLPL remained higher in all calcaemia and serum albumin quartiles. Only 3/119 patients in Group 1 did not receive any PTH-lowering therapies (i.e. calcium carbonate (67%), alfacalcidol (38%), cinacalcet (10.1%), and dialysate calcium ≥1.5 mmol/l (94%)). Conclusion: In this observational French cohort, VLPL was observed in 10% of prevalent HD patients and was associated with poor survival rates. An inadequate therapeutic strategy could be responsible for this observation. The real consequences of this iatrogenic adynamic bone disease remain hypothetical, but it may be related to the risk of developing vascular calcification. It is hypothesized that a more adequate strategy, using fewer PTH-lowering therapies in cases of VLPL, may help in improving the poor prognosis. Copyright © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Background: Vascular calcifications are frequent in Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD-5) patients receiving haemodialysis. The current study was designed to evaluate the associations between bone turnover/volume and coronary artery calcifications (CAC).Methods. In 207 CKD-5 patients, bone biopsies, multislice computed tomography of the coronary arteries and blood drawings for relevant biochemical parameters were done. The large number of CKD-5 patients enrolled allowed separate evaluation of patients with CAC versus patients without CAC and adjustment for traditional and non-traditional risk factors for CAC.Results. When all patients were analysed, associations were found between CAC and bone turnover, bone volume, age, gender and dialysis vintage. When only patients with CAC were included, there was a U-shaped relationship between CAC and bone turnover, whilst the association with bone volume was lost. In these patients, the relationship of CAC with age, gender and dialysis vintage remained.Conclusions. Beyond the non-modifiable risk factors of age, gender and dialysis vintage, these data show that bone abnormalities of renal osteodystrophy amenable to treatment should be considered in the management of patients with CAC. © The Author 2011.

N2  - Background: Abnormal mineral balance is an early complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the altered calcium/phosphate balance is believed to be the risk factor for both cardiovascular complications and renal dysfunction. Studies have convincingly demonstrated that disturbed calcium/phosphate metabolism is involved in the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD patients, particularly in those with maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). Abnormal function of vitamin D metabolites, PTH and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) is closely related to the impaired calcium/phosphate metabolism in CKD patients. The present investigation aimed to study the relationship between circulating FGF- 23 concentration and cardiovascular complications in patients on MHD. Methods: A total of 155 CKD patients at stage 5 and treated in this hemodialysis center during the period from October 2006 to February 2010 were included in the study, and they were observed for 6 months. The patients were divided into cardiovascular event group (group 1, n=57) and non-cardiovascular event group (group 2, n=98). The two groups are comparable in their gender, age, CKD underlying diseases, blood pressure control, hemoglobin level, nutritional status, dialysis modality and dose, and drug use. Cardiovascular events included cardiac death (all death events except for death of defined non-cardiac causes), myocardial infarction (in the presence of pathological Q wave and increase of creatine kinase more than 2 times of the normal upper limit in association with increase of creatine kinase MB above normal, or increase of CK more than 2 times of the normal upper limit without abnormal Q wave), pump failure of grade 3 or more, cardiogenic shock, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular flutter, cardiac rupture, and the need for cardiology intervention (such as coronary thrombolysis and stent placement). FGF-23 level was determined by ELISA (tested every 2 months in pre-dialysis pumping blood, and used the average serum FGF-23 level from 3 assays). Data were expressed as x¯ ± s t test, variance analysis and Pearson correlation analysis were used for the comparison between the two groups. Results: Peripheral blood FGF-23 levels were significantly higher in cardiovascular events group (656.7±182.5 pg/ml) than in non-cardiovascular event group (472.3±128.0 pg/ml, p<0.001). Correlation analysis indicated that peripheral blood FGF-23 levels were closely correlated to the cardiovascular events in MHD patients (r=0.77, p<0.001). Conclusion: The increase of serum FGF-23 in MHD patients may cause secondary vascular calcification, and then lead to cardiovascular events. Therefore, higher serum FGF-23 in MHD patients may be an early warning indicator of cardiovascular events.

N2  - Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no studies on the prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and a median urine protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification, measured by electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, male gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the severity of calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies need to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery calcification in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival. © 2010 International Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Background and Purpose: Extracranial STA calcification is an unusual finding seen in patients with chronic kidney disease that has unknown ramifications with respect to intracranial ischemic disease and etiology. We sought to determine the risk factors associated with this rare phenomenon and to assess the coexistence of cerebral ischemia. Materials and Methods: Medical records and laboratory data on risk factors for vascular calcification were retrospectively retrieved for 453 patients with a discharge diagnosis of ESRD. CT-Head examinations were reviewed to identify and associate STA calcification with 1) risk factors for the vascular calcification, 2) intracranial artery calcification, and 3) cerebral ischemia (white matter and/or cortical ischemic changes). Results: STA calcification was present in 9.9% (45/453) of the studied cohort. The prevalence of cerebral ischemia was 24.4% (11/45) in patients with STA calcification and 9.3% (38/408) in patients without it. Diabetes mellitus (OR 2.56, p = 0.037, 95% CI, 1.059-6.208) and vertebral artery calcification (OR 17.15, p < 0.001, 95% CI, 6.752-43.597) were independently associated with the risk of STA calcification. The risk of cerebral ischemia, however, was not related to the coexistent STA calcification (p = 0.221). Conclusion: The presence of diabetes mellitus is important in describing the risk of STA calcification in patients with ESRD, whereas age, gender, hypertension, serum calcium, serum phosphate, or serum hemoglobin levels are not. The risk of cerebral ischemia is not related to the coexistent STA calcification but has the strongest association with diabetes mellitus and vertebral artery calcification. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background and objectives: Cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is explained in part by traditional cardiovascular risk factors; by uremia-specific factors; and by abnormalities of mineral metabolism, factors involved in its regulation, and in the vascular calcification process. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: In an unselected population of 177 patients with calculated GFR (eGFR) between 90 and 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, the link between the mineral metabolism abnormalities (calcium, phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product), regulatory factors (parathyroid hormone [PTH], intact PTH [iPTH], vitamin D, fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF 23], and fetuin A), and the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) assessed by coronary angiography were evaluated in three subgroups defined by tertiles of Gensini lesion severity score. Results: The mean serum values for FGF 23 in the entire study population was 28.1 ± 17.3 RU/ml and for fetuin A was 473.1 ± 156.2 μg/ml. Patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 had significantly higher values of FGF 23 compared with patients with eGFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The Gensini score values significantly correlated with gender; arterial hypertension; and HDL cholesterol, eGFR, iPTH, FGF 23, and fetuin A levels. After the adjustments for traditional and uremia-related cardiovascular risk factors, the FGF 23 and fetuin A remained significant predictors of the Gensini score. Conclusions: This study suggests that in a relatively young population with mild-to-moderate alteration of kidney function and with less traditional cardiovascular risk factors, anomalies of the serum FGF 23 and fetuin A levels appear early in the course of disease and are independent major predictors for extent of CAD.

N2  - Background: Accurate cardiovascular risk estimation in dialysis patients remains challenging because different pathogenetic mechanisms act simultaneously in this heterogeneous population. Radiographic calcification, aortic stiffness and wave reflection, have each individually been proven to be reliable surrogate markers for outcome. We aimed to explore to what extent these parameters intermutually provide complementary or overlapping information. Methods: Abdominal aortic calcification scoring of a plain lateral abdominal X-ray, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and central augmentation index (AIx) were measured in 1084 dialysis patients, recruited from 47 European dialysis centers. Results: Abdominal calcification correlated well with PWV (R = 0.44, P < 0.001) but poorly with AIx (R = 0.07, P = 0.04). Next to abdominal calcification, tertiles of PWV were associated with a stepwise increase age, blood pressure, and cardiovascular history, and tertiles of AIx with age, heart rate, and anthropometric factors. In multivariate analysis, only PWV remained significantly associated with calcification score. In addition to age and blood pressure, stiffness was mainly related to diabetes and calcification score (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.001), whereas AIx was more dependent on anthropometry, gender and heart rate (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Information on aortic calcification and arterial abnormalities can be obtained by simple and inexpensive methodologies. Variation in wave reflections was mainly explained by anthropometric parameters. Stiffness and calcification partly provided complementary information, particularly in low-risk patients. In this group, likely to benefit most from preventive strategies and commonly considered for renal transplantation, evaluation of cardiovascular risk could be made more accurate by the assessment of both aortic calcification and arterial stiffness. © 2010 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The prevalence and extent of vascular calcification is a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease and of all-cause death in chronic kidney disease patients. Human fetuin-A has been identified as a potent circulating inhibitor of the calcification process. On the other hand, with the advances in the techniques of hemodialysis, the number of long-term survivors of end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis has been increasing and some patients underwent hemodialysis therapy for extremely long term (more than 30 years). We conducted this study to examine the serum levels of fetuin A in extremely long-term hemodialysis survivors. Methods: A total of 131 patients who had been under hemodialysis therapy for less than 30 years and 24 patients for more than 30 years were enrolled in this study. Also, 31 healthy age- and gender-matched control subjects were enrolled. Serum levels of albumin (Alb), calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), fetuin-A, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and bio-parathyroid hormone were measured. Since the presence of abdominal aortic calcification (ACI) is significantly associated with both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients, the abdominal aorta was studied in 10 sequential 8-mm slices above the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta on plain abdominal CT. The ACI was calculated as the proportion of the aortic circumference in each slice that was covered by calcification. Results: The serum level of fetuin A was significantly lower in the hemodialysis patients (0.276±0.060 g/L) than in healthy individuals (0.340±0.054 g/L, p<0.001). The serum level of OPG was significantly higher in the hemodialysis patients (375.0±233.7 pg/mL) than in the healthy individuals (87.4±24.2 pg/mL, p<0.001). The ACI was higher in the hemodialysis patients (42.1±20.8%) than in the healthy individuals (1.5±2.4%, p<0.001). The ACI was positively correlated with the age (r=0.281), duration of hemodialysis therapy (r=0.191), serum OPG (r=0.301), serum P (r=0.217) and serum calcium-phosphorus product (Ca - P)/Fetuin A (r=0.452) in the hemodilaysis patients. The ACI was negatively correlated with the serum albumin (r=-0.181) and serum fetuin A (r=-0.386) in the hemodialysis patients. The serum level of fetuin A was significantly higher in the hemodialysis patients for more than 30 years (0.373±0.086 g/L) than in those for less than 30 years (0.279±0.063 g/L, p<0.001). And the ACI was not higher in the HD patients for more than 30 years, compared with those for less than 30 years (48.7±33.4 vs 42.2±22.7%), indicating that high fetuin-A slowed an increase of aortic calcification for the long-term. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the ACI was negatively correlated with serum fetuin A (r=-0.386). Extremely long-term hemodialysis survivors (more than 30 years) had high serum levels of fetuin A, which may be advantageous for long-term survival.

N2  - Introduction and Aims: The epidemic of cardiovascular disease in CKD is explained in part by traditional cardiovascular risk factors, by the uremia specific factors but also by the abnormalities of the mineral metabolism and the novel molecules involved in its regulation and in the vascular calcification process. Methods: In a population of 177 patients with CKD 2 and 3 we evaluated the link between the mineral metabolism abnormalities (Ca, P, CaxP), the regulatory factors (PTH, vitamin D, FGF 23 and fetuin A) and the severity of CAD assessed by coronarography in three subgroups defined by tertiles of CAD Gensini lesion severity score. Results: The mean serum values for FGF 23 was 28.1±17.3 ru/ml (median 21.9 ru/ml) and for fetuin A were 473.1±156.2 μg/ml (median 435.1 μg/ml). Patients with CKD 3 had significantly higher values of FGF 23 compared with CKD 2 (43.3±21.6 vs 25.9±15.7; p=0.001) but similar mean values for fetuin A (433.1±175.3 VS 478.5±153.3; p=0.2). The Gensini score values significantly correlated in univariate analysis with gender (R = -0.254, P = 0.0001); presence of hypertension (R = -0.284, P = 0.0001); HDL cholesterol level (R = -0.179, P = 0.024); GFR (R = -0.315, P=0.0001), iPTH (R=0.185; P= 0.017); FGF 23 R=0.819; p=0.0001), (Figure 1) and fetuin A levels (R=-0.491 P=0001), (Figure 2) but not with the vitamin D values. After the adjustments for traditional and uremia related cardiovascular risk factors, the FGF 23 (B=0.616; p=0.000) and fetuin A (B= -0.186; p=0.002) remained statistically significant predictors of the Gensini score, the model explaining 67% of the variation in the Gensini score (p=0.012). Conclusions: Our study suggests that in a relatively young population with mild to moderate CKD, and with less traditional cardiovascular risk factors, abnormal serum levels of FGF 23 and fetuin A appear early in the course of disease, and are independent major predictors for the coronary artery disease extent.

N2  - Aims: Vascular calcification and atherosclerosis frequently develop in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although several reports have investigated both carotid artery calcification (CAAC) and carotid atherosclerosis in ESRD patients, the relationship between the two vascular conditions has remained unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of CAAC and carotid artery plaque (CAP) in patients with ESRD and to investigate potential factors contributing to the development of CAAC and CAP. Material and method: This cross-sectional study assessed CAAC and CAP using multi-detector computed tomography and high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, respectively, in 135 patients with ESRD at the start of hemodialysis. The prevalence of CAAC and CAP was examined. The risk factors associated with CAAC and CAP were also evaluated using a logistic regression model. Results: CAAC and CAP were found in 71% and 65%, of the patients, respectively. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and gender showed that CAAC was significantly associated with age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, serum albumin, calcium-phosphorus product, proteinuria and CAP. In contrast, in the same analysis, CAP was significantly correlated with age, male gender, diabetes, intact parathyroid hormone, proteinuria and CAAC. In the multivariate analysis, CAAC was independently associated with age, hypertension, and calcium-phosphorus product. Male gender was identified as an independent determinant for CAP. Furthermore, CAP remained as an independent risk factor of CAAC (odds ratio (OR): 13.89; 95% confidence interval (CI): 4.08-47.29), and CAAC also showed a high OR for having CAP (OR: 11.74; 95% CI: 4.12-33.51). Conclusion: Both CAAC and CAP were associated with traditional and/or non-traditional risk factors. The risk factors of CAAC were different from those of CAP. CAAC or CAP was identified to be an independent risk factor for each other with a high OR, thus suggesting a strong relationship between carotid calcification and atherosclerosis. ©2010 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.

N2  - All patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on dialysis are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (1). In fact, cardiovascular disease (CVD) in its various manifestations (e.g. myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, lower extremity occlusive disease, amputations, etc.) is the leading cause of death in patients with ESRD, accounting for nearly 50% of deaths. (2) After adjusting for age, gender, race, and diagnosis of diabetes, mortality from cardiovascular disease is far higher in patients with ESRD compared to the general population. (3) ESRD and cardiovascular disease have interlocking relationships and to not act as wholly independent processes. A 'synergy' exists whereby CVD can precipitate ESRD by virtue of damage to the blood vessels and kidneys from high blood pressure, circulating inflammatory factors, etc., and conversely, ESRD, arterial calcification, and the effects of its associated treatment, renal replacement therapy, or hemodialysis (HD), can be seen as a harbinger of CVD. This relationship is highly complex, involving both “traditional” and “non-traditional” CVD risk factors. The 2005 report of the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines stresses these interactions and recommends aggressive CVD screening and treatment for all ESRD patients receiving HD (4). Several recent large-scale registry studies estimate that up to 60% of new ESRD patients have some manifestation of CVD (5). Likewise, The American Heart Association issued a statement in 2003 that recommended patients with ESRD be considered a “highest risk group” for subsequent cardiovascular disease events (6). Like coronary causes of CVD, non-coronary causes of cardiovascular disease (e.g. lower extremity occlusive disease, cerebrovascular disease) are thought to be more prevalent in the ESRD population than among the general population, with estimates ranging from 4%-45% (depending on the definition and population studied) and are responsible for significant morbidity, disability, decrements in quality of life, and death (7). As PAD is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality in the general and dialysis population, early diagnosis of PAD and aggressive medical therapy might improve cardiovascular survival in dialysis patients, but there are currently no randomized, controlled trials of any of the interventions for therapy of PAD in dialysis patients. Data is limited, as most trials of CVD treatments (e.g. lipid lowering medications, etc.) do not include people with chronic kidney disease or ESRD. Comprehensive reviews of the literature (8) indicating medical treatments of CVD (aspirin, statins and beta blockers) are underused in ESRD/HD patients and chronic kidney disease patients.

N2  - Vascular calcification is one of the mechanisms mediating the higher mortality risk associated with the hyperphosphatemia of chronic kidney disease. Though common, and often severe in non-dialyzed proteinuric diabetics, there are no studies on the prognostic significance of coronary artery calcification in early stage type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Here we determine this significance in 225 proteinuric diabetic patients (mean age 57 years, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 52 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and a median urine protein-creatinine ratio of 2.7). Coronary artery calcification, measured by electron beam computed tomography, was diagnosed in 86% of the patients, the severity of which correlated with older age, male gender, and white ethnicity. However, no association was found between eGFR, serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, or 25-hydroxy vitamin D. Over an average follow-up of 39 months, 54 patients died. A graded relationship between the severity of calcification and all-cause mortality was consistently demonstrated on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients in the highest quartile of calcification score had a 2.5-fold higher risk for death. Our results show the severity of coronary artery calcification early in the course of chronic kidney disease is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Additional studies need to determine whether altering the natural history of coronary artery calcification in early chronic kidney disease prolongs survival.Kidney International advance online publication, 17 March 2010; doi:10.1038/ki.2010.70.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is increasingly appreciated as an important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. AIMS: To assess (1) the evolution of coronary calcification and (2) the relationship of the progression of coronary calcification with risk factors and adverse cardiovascular events. METHODS: We performed repeated 16 row multidetector computed tomography (CT) with an interval of 1 year on 33 patients on chronic hemodialysis. RESULTS: Progression of coronary artery calcification was found in 70% of patients with a mean significant difference of calcium score. Patients older than 65 years demonstrated a higher progression of coronary calcification and patients who received non-calcium phosphate binder treatments demonstrated less progression. During the year, 6 adverse cardiovascular events occurred. A total of 22% of patients with progression of coronary calcification had a cardiovascular event (p=.003). Factors associated with adverse cardiovascular events included diabetes, male gender, history of cerebrovascular and coronary disease, secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, and calcification of circumflex and right coronary arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery calcification progression is common, represents a risk factor to adverse cardiovascular events, and is associated with modifiable risk factors in chronic hemodialysis. Multidetector CT seems to be an effective and readily applicable method to assess and quantify the progression of coronary artery calcification.

N2  - Background and objectives: Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Vitamin D might have beneficial effects on vascular health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25D] ≤ 15 ng/ml) and insufficiency (25D levels between 16 and 30 ng/ml) in a cohort of patients at different CKD stages and the relationships between vitamin D serum levels, vascular calcification and stiffness, and the mortality risk. Design, setting, participants & measurements: One hundred forty CKD patients (85 men, mean age 67 ± 12 yr; CKD stages 2 [8%], 3 [26%], 4 [26%], 5 [7%], and 5D [(33%]) were allocated for a prospective study. Serum levels of 25D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, aortic calcification score, and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were evaluated. Results: There was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (42%) and insufficiency (34%). Patients with 25D ≤ 16.7 ng/ml (median) had a significantly lower survival rate than patients with 25D >16.7 ng/ml (mean follow-up, 605 ± 217 d; range, 10 to 889; P = 0.05). Multivariate adjustments (included age, gender, diabetes, arterial pressure, CKD stage, phosphate, albumin, hemoglobin, aortic calcification score and PWV) confirmed 25D level as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were highly prevalent in this CKD cohort. Low 25D levels affected mortality independently of vascular calcification and stiffness, suggesting that 25D may influence survival in CKD patients via additional pathways that need to be further explored.

N2  - Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common complication of chronic kidney disease, and a frequent cause of clinically significant bone disease. In patient with chronic renal disease subset of patients, who manifest a severe form of this chronic complication, have soft tissue and vascular calcification, which are additional serious consequences of the disorder. A retrospective case-controlled study was conducted to address the magnitude of this problem, its associated risk factors, and morbidity in chronic hemodialysis patients. The hospital records of 248 prevalent hemodialysis patients, over two years (2005-2006) were reviewed, of which two groups were identified, based on their PTH level, group ( I ), 23 males, and 17 females, mean age 48.3±8.9 years, with PTH persistently elevated (>800 pg/ml) mean PTH 1160±87 pg/ml, and a control group ( II ), 17 males and 14 females, mean age 44.5± 6.3 years, with stable PTH level mean PTH 236±30 pg/ml. The prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism was 17% (40 cases), with male to female ratio of 1.3: 1, hyperphosphataemia was recorded in 68% (27) of these hyperparathyroid patients. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism was observed in 3 cases (1.2%), all of male gender, with mean PTH level 2086±34 pg/ml. The risk factors contributing to development of severe secondary hyperparathyroidism were; persistent hyperphosphatemia, and early loss of residual renal function. The most remarkable associated morbidities in group (I) hyperparathyroid patients were; tertiary hyperparathyroidism, shorter survival of arterio-venous fistula, calciphylaxis, and aortic valve calcification.

N2  - We studied the incidence and progression of coronary artery calcification in people with early chronic kidney disease. We used a cohort of 562 adult patients with chronic kidney disease who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, in a community-based study of people without clinical cardiovascular disease, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. The majority had stage 3 disease. Coronary artery calcification was measured at baseline and again approximately 1.6 or 3.2 years later. The prevalence of coronary artery calcification at baseline was 66%, and its adjusted prevalence was 24% lower in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. The incidence of coronary artery calcification was 6.1% per year in women and 14.8% in men. Coronary artery calcification progressed in approximately 17% of subjects per year across all subgroups, and diabetes was associated with a 65% greater adjusted risk of progression. Male gender and diabetes were the only factors associated with adjusted coronary artery calcification incidence and progression, respectively. Our study shows that coronary artery calcification is common in people with stage 3 disease, progresses rapidly, and may contribute to cardiovascular risk. © 2009 International Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Background. Expression of bone proteins resulting from transdifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblasts suggests that vascular calcifications are a bioactive process. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) could play a key role in bone-vascular calcification imbalance and could be a marker of vascular calcification extent and progression. The purpose of this study was to evaluate relationships between vascular risk biomarkers (including classic risk factors and OPG) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) extent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and to establish within the markers the appropriate cut-off value to predict CAC.Methods. A total of 133 non-dialyzed CKD patients at various stages of kidney disease 75 males58 females, median age: 69.9 (27.4-94.6) were enrolled, excluding extrarenal replacement therapy patients. All underwent chest multidetector computed tomography for CAC scoring. Blood samples were collected for measurement of vascular risk markers (kidney disease, inflammation, nutrition, calcium phosphate and OPG). A potential relationship between CAC and these biological markers was investigated, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was designed thereafter to identify a cut-off value of involved markers that best predicted the presence of CAC.Results. After adjustment for age, diabetes, smoking and gender, among biological markers, only low-estimated glomerular filtration rate using Modification of Diet in Renal Disease OR = 3.63 (1.10-12.02), high FEPO4 OR = 3.99 (1.17-13.6) and high OPG levels OR = 8.54 (2.14-34.11) were associated with the presence of CAC. A protective effect of 1.25(OH)2 vitamin D OR = 0.20 (0.05-0.79) and LDL cholesterol OR = 0.27 (0.08-0.94) on CAC was also observed. ROC curve analysis showed that the OPG best cut-off value predicting CAC was 757.7 pgmL.Conclusion. These results suggest that a CAC increase is strongly associated with a plasma OPG increase in CKD patients. The values of OPG >757.7 pgmL allow us to predict the presence of CAC in these patients.

N2  - Background/Aims: Dialysis patients display an increased mortality which is associated with cardiovascular calcifications. Diabetes mellitus and ethnicity are known factors that affect the extent of cardiovascular calcifications. However, most studies have investigated mixed cohorts with diabetics and/or mixed ethnicity. Methods: Cardiovascular calcifications were assessed in non-diabetic Caucasian haemodialysis patients by the semiquantitative Adragao calcification score (X-ray pelvis and hands) and a novel composite calcification score encompassing the Adragao score as well as calcifications detected by X-ray of the fistula arm, echocardiography of heart valves and carotid ultrasound. Results: Using multivariate analysis, age, male gender, dialysis vintage, lower Kt/V, calcium-phosphate product, smoking and high-sensitivity CRP were independent risk factors for cardiovascular calcifications as assessed by the Adragao or the composite score. Pulse wave velocity was independently related to both calcification scores. Body mass index, cholesterol, triglycerides, iPTH and serum levels of fetuin-A and uncarboxylated matrix Gla protein were not associated with cardiovascular calcifications. Conclusions: In our cohort of non-diabetic Caucasian haemodialysis patients, age, male gender, dialysis vintage, smoking, calcium-phosphate product, high-sensitivity CRP and lower Kt/V were independent risk factors for cardiovascular calcifications. Whether lowering the calcium-phosphate product and increasing dialysis efficiency can reduce cardiovascular calcifications in dialysis patients remains to be determined. Copyright © 2009 S.

N2  - Background. Vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis are major causes of death in haemodialysis (HD) patients. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of enzymes, involved in the biology of extracellular matrix and in atherogenesis. MMP1 and MMP3 contribute to the enlargement and instability of atherosclerotic plaque, respectively. The common polymorphisms on MMP1 (2G2G) and MMP3 (6A6A) gene promoters have been related to increased coronary artery calcification and to carotid artery stenosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of MMP1 and MMP3 polymorphisms with end-stage renal failure (ESRD) and all-cause mortality risk in HD.Methods. Ninety-nine HD patients, followed-up for 36 months, and 133 matched controls were genotyped for the two polymorphisms. HD patients' characteristics were age 64 ± 13 years, males 64, diabetic 24, hypertensive 62, smokers 38, dyslipidaemic 28, all undergoing standard HD thrice weekly.Results. ESRD was strongly associated with the combination of 2G2G and 6A6A homozygosity: OR 2.57 (0.95-7.4), P = 0.037, but not with isolated 2G2G and 6A6A homozygosity (P = 0.09 and P = 0.11, respectively). Isolated 2G2G was associated with all-cause mortality risk independently from age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidaemia, C-reactive protein, albumin, dialysis vintage and history of cardio-vascular disease: HR 2.96 (1.29-6.80), P = 0.01. A trend for the association of mortality and isolated 6A6A homozygosity was also observed: HR 3.01 (0.88-10.26), P = 0.078. Combination of 2G2G and 6A6A homozygosity significantly increased the mortality risk in the same Cox regression model: HR 4.69 (1.72-12.81), P = 0.003.Conclusions. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that MMP-1 and MMP-3 gene polymorphisms are negative prognostic risk factors for all-cause mortality in HD patients, independently from traditional risk factors. These data may have important implications for better understanding the pathogenesis of the increased mortality in HD patients.

N2  - Background. Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death among renal transplant recipients. Aortic calcification is associated with increased mortality in dialysis subjects. The significance of aortic calcification among renal transplant recipients is unknown. Our objective was to prospectively examine the association of aortic calcification with cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality among asymptomatic incident renal transplant recipients.Methods. One hundred and twelve renal transplant recipients underwent electron beam computed tomography.Aortic calcification was scored by the Agatston method. The mean follow-up time was 5.1 years. Cardiovascular events (heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease and stroke) and all-cause mortality were recorded. Results. The cohort consisted of 62% Caucasians, 38% African Americans and 62% male gender. The mean age was 49.0 12.5 years. Thirty-four percent had aortic calcification. During follow-up, 12 cardiovascular events and 10 deaths were recorded. Subjects with aortic calcification had more cardiovascular events compared to those without aortic calcification (23.7 versus 4.1%, P = 0.001). Recipients with aortic calcification had higher mortality compared to those without aortic calcification but it did not reach statistical significance (15.8 versus 5.4%, P = 0.07). The univariate hazard ratio of aortic calcification score in a proportional hazard Cox model to assess event-free survival was 1.15 (1.041.27, P = 0.01). Diabetes and aortic calcification score were independently associated with survival. In addition to the predictors above, dialysis vintage was an independent predictor for combined future cardiovascular event and mortality.Conclusions. In conclusion, aortic calcification is prevalent among renal transplant recipients and is predictive of future cardiovascular events. Aortic calcification is easily identified by non-invasive testing, and should be considered when assessing cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic renal transplant recipients.

N2  - Background. Vascular calcifications (VCs) are frequently observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and haemodialysis (HD) patients. They have been associated with numerous factors, particularly hyperphosphataemia, excess calcium load, hypertension and increased mortality rate. The purpose of this study is to measure VCs in long-HD patients with good blood pressure and phosphate control, with the occasional use of sevelamer, using a plain radiological score to identify the associated factors and effects on the 1-year survival rate. Methods. We studied HD patients from one centre using a semi-quantitative score ranging from 0 to 3 according to the severity and extent of VCs. The following patients' characteristics were compared according to their VC scores: medical history, treatments, blood pressure, standard biological data, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23, osteoprotegerin (OPG), whole PTH, β-crosslaps, bone alkaline phosphatases and bone mineral density scores. One-year survival analyses were also performed. Results. Among the 250 HD patients of the centre, 161 were studied; the mean age was 67.2 ± 13 years, 45% of the subjects were females, 35% were diabetics, and they had been on dialysis for between 1-486 months (median: 45 months) with a 3 × 5-3 × 8 h dialysis schedule using 1.5 mmol/l dialysate calcium and providing a mean 2.25 ± 0.5 Kt/V. Only 17% of the patients were free from VCs and 11% had severe VCs. The factors associated with VCs were classified into 'classic' (age, diabetes, male gender, tobacco use, inflammation, more frequent warfarin treatment and peripheral vascular and cardiac diseases) and 'non-traditional' (higher FGF-23 and OPG serum levels, low albumin serum levels and low alfacalcidol and CaCO3 use). In logistic regression, only age, diabetes and FGF-23 serum levels were associated with VC scores of 2 and 3. The patients with a score of 3 had a higher 1-year mortality rate (RR 2.1; P = 0.01) as compared to patients with a 0 score. Conclusion. A plain radiological score showed the high prevalence (83%) of VCs in HD patients in spite of a long and intensive dialysis strategy and adherence to guidelines. The main associated factors were classic factors such as ageing and diabetes. No relationship was found with blood pressure and phosphataemia that remained well controlled in long dialysis; the association with FGF-23 serum levels may aggregate some non-traditional risk factors. The harmful effects of VCs on survival require their systematic assessment and optimization of the potentially modifiable associated factors in CKD and HD patients. © The Author [2008].

N2  - Vascular calcification is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for vascular access calcification and to determine if patients with this disorder are at increased risk of death. Vascular access calcification was found in 49 of 212 hemodialysis patients as measured by plain X-ray (arteriovenous fistula or synthetic graft) in two dimensions. Male gender, diabetes mellitus, and length of time on dialysis were independent predictors for access calcification determined by logistic regression multivariate analysis. Serum parameters were not independently related to access calcification. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed an increased mortality risk, and Cox regression analysis confirmed that vascular access calcification was an independent mortality predictor. Our study suggests that detection of vascular access calcification is a cost-effective method to identify patients at increased mortality risk. © 2008 International Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD), and particularly kidney failure, is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and approximately a 20-fold increased risk of cardiovascular death. The majority of these patients die from complications directly attributed to atherosclerosis and their life expectancy is decreased. Established risk factors are involved in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. Age, gender, smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus are among the established risk factors. Inflammation, qualitative lipid disorders (e.g. small dense low density lipoprotein), vascular calcification and oxidative stress represent emerging risk factors. The precise mechanism of atherosclerosis in patients with kidney failure is not yet known. CKD might represent a clinical model of atherogenesis. Thus, the evidence obtained from investigating "renal" atherogenesis could be of interest in improving our understanding of this disease process in the non-renal population. We review the relationship between "renal" and non-renal atherosclerosis focusing on pathogenesis, risk factors and clinical events and how they interact with treatment options. Overall, the "later" stages of CKD may eventually be considered as a coronary heart disease equivalent condition. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  - Background: Fetuin-A, a negative acute phase protein that inhibits vascular calcification, has a controversial association with mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Chronic inflammation, which is common in CKD, may promote vascular calcification. Materials and methods: We investigated the impact of inflammation on the relationship between serum fetuin-A and mortality (42 months) in 222 prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients. Results: Serum fetuin correlated negatively with comorbidity score (assessed by Davies score) and circulating inflammatory markers. Patients with low fetuin-A levels (< median) had higher mortality (Hazard ratio 'HR' 2.2; CI 1.4-3.5, P < 0.001), but this association was lost after adjustment for age, gender, comorbidities score, dialysis vintage and inflammation (CRP > median). In inflamed patients with low fetuin a significantly independent association with mortality (HR 2.3; CI 1.2-4.5, P = 0.01) was observed compared to non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A, after adjusting for the same variables. Non-inflamed patients with low fetuin-A and inflamed patients with high fetuin-A did not have increased mortality compared to non-inflamed patients with high fetuin-A. Conclusions: The results show that low levels of serum fetuin-A are associated with increased mortality in HD patients only in the presence of inflammation. This suggests that coexistence of a low serum fetuin-A level and low-grade inflammation exerts an additive effect on the risk of death in HD patients. © 2008 The Authors.

N2  - Increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (Aix), and vascular calcification have been associated with an unfavourable cardiovascular outcome in hemodialysis patients. However, the majority of data have been published in white patients and epidemiological data are discordant on the fate of patients of different races. In this cross sectional study we measured PWV and Aix by applanation tonometry and coronary artery and thoracic aorta calcium score (CAC and AoC) by electron beam tomography (EBT) in 81 Blacks and 61 Whites on maintenance hemodialysis. Vascular stiffness measurements and EBT scans were performed within a week of each other. There was no difference between races in age, systolic blood pressure or gender distribution. Blacks had a more frequent history of hypertension (100% versus 89%; P = 0.002), lower prevalence of dyslipidemia (30% versus 66%; P < 0.001), higher PTH levels (geometric mean 607 pg/ml versus 245 pg/ml; P = 0.039), received calcium based phosphate binders less frequently (37% versus 60%, P = 0.007) and calcium antagonists more frequently than Whites (54% versus 28%; P = 0.003). Nonetheless, the unadjusted and risk adjusted PWV and Aix, as well as CAC and AoC were not statistically different between races. In this dialysis cohort there was no difference in markers of vasculopathy between black and white patients despite differences in baseline clinical characteristics. Epidemiological data from the general population indicate that Blacks have lower calcium scores and stiffer vessels than Whites. Some studies in the renal populations suggest a better and others a similar survival of Blacks and Whites on hemodialysis. Our findings raise the important question of the prognostic significance of markers of vasculopathy in patients of different races and with different risk profiles. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Background. Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1) generates inorganic pyrophosphate, a solute that serves as an essential physiological inhibitor of calcification. Inactivating mutations of ENPP1 are associated with generalized arterial calcification of infancy. We hypothesized the ENPP1 K121Q variant to be associated with increased vascular calcification in patients with end-stage renal failure. Subjects and methods. We recruited 79 patients with end-stage renal failure undergoing dialysis treatment and genotyped them for the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism. Next, we matched to each patient with ENPP1 121KQ genotype (n = 15) a respective control with ENPP1 121KK genotype by gender, age, diabetes and duration of dialysis treatment. The matching ratio was 1:1. Severity of coronary calcification was quantified by computed tomography, and aortic stiffness was measured by pulse-wave analysis. Results. Patients with ENPP1 121KQ genotype had a significantly higher coronary calcium score (1385 vs 94; n = 30; P = 0.033), and also a higher aortic pulse-wave velocity when compared to matched controls with ENPP1 121KK genotype (13.69 m/s vs 9.37 m/s; P = 0.003). Conclusions. Taken together, our study suggests a potential role of the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism in arterial calcification of patients with end-stage renal failure. Patients heterozygous for the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism have higher coronary calcification scores and increased aortic stiffness, and may benefit from more intense treatment in order to prevent progression of arterial calcification. © The Author [2007].

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is increasingly recognized as an important component of cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease. The objective of this study was to investigate prospectively the determinants, cardiovascular functional consequences, and survival associated with vascular calcification over 24 mo. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 134 patients (60 on hemodialysis, 28 on peritoneal dialysis, and 46 with stage 4 chronic kidney disease) were studied. Vascular calcification of the superficial femoral artery was assessed using multislice spiral computed tomography; pulse wave velocity; all medications and time-averaged biochemical parameters were recorded at baseline and 12 and 24 mo. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients remained at 24 mo. Progressive calcification was seen in 58 of 101 patients. Most (31 of 46) patients with an initial calcification score of zero did not develop calcification. The hemodialysis group demonstrated a greater degree of progression than patients who were on peritoneal dialysis or had stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Progressive calcification was associated with age, male gender, serum alkaline phosphatase, beta blockers, and lipid-lowering agents. Increases in vascular calcification correlated with increased arterial stiffness. Vascular calcification was present in 20 of 21 patients who died. Cox proportional hazard analysis identified change in calcification score, calcium intake from phosphate binders, and low albumin as risk factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stages 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease and preexisting vascular calcification exhibit significantly increased calcification over 24 mo. Rapid progression of calcification is associated with arterial stiffness and mortality.

N2  - Vascular calcifications in CKD are now linked to serum alterations of both divalent ions and calcification inhibitory proteins. Due to possible biochemical differences between dialysis (D) and transplantation (Tx), we examined the entity and severity of these biochemical modifications and of coronary artery calcium score separately in these two populations. We assayed, besides standard markers of inflammation, divalent ions and serum levels of fetuin, matrix Gla protein (MGP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), in 51 Tx patients (age 45 ± 12 years; 30 males, 21 females; previous D duration 4.8 ± 4.2 years; Tx since 6.6 ± 5.5 years; Cr 1.8 ± 0.6 mg/dl) and in 49 D patients (age 49 ± 14 years; 30 males,19 females; D duration 5.6 ± 4.8 years). Additionally, coronary calcium score (AS) was evaluated by cardiac multi-slice CT. Compared with D patients, Tx patients had better values of divalent ions and inflammation markers, and lower prevalence (65 vs. 86%; p < 0.02) and severity (AS = 570 ± 1,637 vs. 1,311 ± 3,128; p < 0.008) of coronary calcification. In addition, a tendency toward normalization for all of the three calcification inhibitory proteins was evident. In both Tx and D, AS correlated with age and OPG (Tx: rs = 0.439, p < 0.001, and rs = 0.510, p < 0.0001; D: rs = 0.471, p < 0.001, and rs = 0.403, p < 0.005, respectively); in D patients, a correlation was present also with D duration (rs = 0.435; p < 0.002), other markers of inflammation and, notably, fetuin (rs = -0.442; p < 0.002). Regression analysis selected previous time on D in Tx patients (rm = 0.400; p < 0.004), and C-reactive protein and OPG in D patients (rm = 0.518; p < 0.004) as the most predictive parameters of AS. Discriminant analysis confirmed the major role of age and D duration in the appearance of AS and evidenced male gender as a distinct risk condition. At variance, Tx duration was never associated with AS. In conclusion, as compared to D, renal Tx patients show serum levels of calcification inhibition proteins and of divalent ions closer to normal. As this is associated with a lower prevalence and severity of AS, it is suggested that Tx antagonize the accelerating role of D in the progression of vascular calcification. Assessment of both coronary calcifications and serum levels of calcification inhibitory proteins may be of value to identify those subjects at higher risk of development and progression of vascular lesions, among whom males have the highest rate.

N2  - Background: In the presence of decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the risk of morbidity and mortality caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increased markedly. Increased coronary artery calcification (CAC) is proposed as a pathogenetic link between CVD and chronic kidney disease. We examined the frequency and severity of CAC in living kidney donors to test the hypothesis that decreased GFR is associated with increased CAC. Methods: We used multidetector spiral computed tomography to examine CAC in 101 living kidney donors and 99 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects without diabetes and a history of coronary artery disease. The extent of calcification was measured by means of the Agatston score. GFR was calculated by using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. The frequency of risk factors for coronary artery disease was compared in kidney donors and controls, and the relation between kidney donors' clinical characteristics and the presence or absence of CAC was examined. Results: CAC frequency and mean calcification scores were similar between kidney donors (13.9%; 4.5 ± 22.6) and controls (17.2%; 13.2 ± 89.2). CAC was not associated with decreased GFR, and the correlation between CAC and GFR was not statistically significant. Kidney donors with calcification were more likely to be older (P = 0.003) and male (P = 0.001). Age- and sex-adjusted analysis showed an association between greater parathormone levels (odds ratio, 1.023; 95% confidence interval, 1.001 to 1.045; P = 0.037) and CAC in kidney donors. Conclusion: A mild decrease in GFR without the presence of diabetes does not seem to be associated with increased CAC. These findings need to be confirmed in different and larger study populations. © 2006 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

N2  - We will present our experience and our preliminary data about the correlation between cardiac calcification and QT interval (and QT dispersion) in uraemia. We studied 32 haemodialysis (HD) patients (age 69 ± 16 years, time on dialysis 32 ± 27 months) and 12 chronic kidney disease stage 4 (CKD-4) patients (age 66 ± 17 years, uraemia duration 38 ± 16 months). The patients were characterized by a good mineral control, as shown by serum phosphate levels (3.6 ± 1.3 mg/dl in CKD-4 and 4.3 ± 1.6 mg/dl in HD patients) and Ca x P product (46 ± 17 and 49 ± 16 mg2/dl2, respectively). The parathyroid hormone levels were higher in HD than CKD-4 patients (p < 0.0001). A TC score >400 was found to be highly prevalent in both groups. Significantly more HD patients (62.5%) showed cardiac calcification than CKD-4 patients (33%; p = 0.01). The patients were matched for TC scores higher or lower than 400. The two groups differed by gender (p < 0.05), age (p = 0.026), frequency of diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01), uraemia follow-up period (p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (p = 0.009), Ca x P product (p = 0.002), parathyroid hormone level (p < 0.0001), and corrected QT dispersion (p < 0.0001). The QT interval was higher in HD and CKD-4 patients with higher TC scores (approximately 11%), but QT interval dispersion was significantly higher in patients with TC scores >400. QT dispersion showed a linear correlation with TC scores in both groups (r = 0.899 and p < 0.0001 and r = 0.901 and p < 0.0001). Male gender, age, time (months) of uraemia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, albumin, calcium x phosphorus product, parathyroid hormone, and TC score are important determinants of QT dispersion. Our data show that it is possible to link dysrhythmias and cardiac calcification in uraemic patients. Copyright © 2006 S. Karger AG.

N2  - The risk factors for vascular calcification (VC) in dialysis patients include duration of dialysis, diabetes mellitus, aging, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and calcium or vitamin D supplementation. This study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors for VC in our dialysis population. Methods. One hundred twenty-nine chronic dialysis patients underwent plain x-rays of the hands for VC. Patients were grouped as either positive (PVC) or negative (NVC) for VC. Age, gender, duration of dialysis, presence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), oral calcium, and 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 supplement, serum levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), calcium phosphorus product (CaxP), alkaline phosphates (ALP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were compared between the two groups. Results. Thirty-four patients (26.35%) showed VC. There were no differences between PVC and NVC patients for duration of dialysis (38.4 ± 27.7 for PVC and 34.6 ± 31.2 months for NVC, P = .80), levels of serum Ca (P = .26), P (P = .19), CaxP (P = .33), ALP (P = .89), or iPTH (P = .24). Similarly, oral calcium and 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 intake were not different between the two groups (P = .971 and P = .3710 respectively). Compared to NVC patients, PVC patients were older (56.3 ± 10.4 versus 47.5 ± 16.1 years, P = .008) and had a greater incidence of NIDDM (17/34 PVC and diabetic versus 20/95 NVC, P = .001). In conclusion, for patients with a medium length of dialysis, the duration of dialysis as well as the doses of calcium salts and of 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 were not significantly associated with vascular calcifications, but it was not possible to exclude a role for these and other factors in patients with longer dialysis. © 2005 by Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background. Vascular calcification is common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and a central characteristic of the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease observed in dialysis patients. Fetuin-A, a circulating calcium-regulatory glycoprotein that inhibits vascular calcification, is associated with inflammation and outcome in dialysis patients. In the present study, we evaluated the association between fetuin-A, clinical phenotype, and outcome, as well as the impact of fetuin gene (AHSG) polymorphisms on the protein product and outcome. Methods. In a cohort of 258 (161 males) ESRD patients starting renal replacement therapy [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 6.8 ±0.2 mL/min] aged 52 ±1 years the following parameters were studied: presence of malnutrition (subjective global assessment), comorbidity [diabetes mellitus and clinical manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD)], carotid plaques (N = 101), hs-CRP, fetuin-A, S-albumin, interleukin (IL)-6, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AHSG gene (N = 215) at amino acid positions Thr248Met (C→T), Thr256Ser (C→G), Asp276Asn (G→A), and Arg317Cys (C→T). Results. Both all-cause (P < 0.001) and cardiovascular (P < 0.001) mortality were associated with low fetuin-A levels independently of age, smoking diabetes, S-albumin, CVD, and inflammation (CRP ≥10 mg/L). Inflamed (0.199 vs. 0.247 g/L; P < 0.01) and malnourished (0.207 vs. 0.262 g/L; P < 0.05) patients had significantly lower median fetuin-A than noninflamed and well-nourished ESRD patients, respectively. In a logistic regression model (N =101), fetuin-A was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the presence of carotid plaques independently of age, CVD, diabetes, S-albumin, gender, and inflammation. Significant correlations were observed between fetuin-A and both S-albumin (Rho = 0.30; P < 0.0001) and IL-6 (Rho = -0.21; P < 0.01). Patients with the AHSG 256Ser allele had lower serum fetuin-A levels, and higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rate if they were inflamed. Conclusion. The present study shows that a low fetuin-A level is associated with malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (carotid plaques), as well as with increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Because the present study demonstrates an effect of variations in the AHSG gene on both circulating fetuin-A levels and outcome, this indicates that ESRD patients with the AHSG 256Ser allele are at risk of accelerated vascular calcification. © 2005 by the International Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Background: In the general population, aortic arch calcification (AAC) is related to cardiovascular (CV) disease. Vascular calcifications are common findings in dialysis patients; therefore, we carried out a retrospective study evaluating which risk factors are associated to AAC in stable hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods: Standard posterior-anterior chest radiographs, performed the day after the midweek HD session in 132 patients (mean age 65 ± 12 yrs) who had been on renal replacement therapy (RRT) for 33 months (range 1-471), were analyzed. Cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) was also calculated. Results: AAC was detected in 51% of patients. They were older (68 ± 8 vs. 62 ± 14 yrs; p=0.003), were on RRT for longer (51 (range 2-471) vs. 22 (range 1-195) months; p=0.0001), had greater CTR (54 (32-71) vs. 50% (40-65); p=0.034) and higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) (40 vs. 17%; p=0.049), whilst body weight was lower (62 ± 14 vs. 68 ± 14 kg; p=0.04) than those without AAC. On the contrary, sex, diabetes frequency, smoking habit, history of hypertension and hyperphosphatemia, cerebrovascular and ischemic heart disease (IHD), blood pressure (BP) and antihypertensive therapy, lipids, albumin, degree of anemia, calcium, phosphate and their product were no different between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio (OR) 1.069 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.02-1.11; p=0.003), length of time on RRT (OR 1.02 95% CI 1.01-1.03; p=0.0002), calcium-phosphate product (OR 1.03 95% CI 1.007-1.07; p=0.016), systolic BP (OR 1.03 95% CI 1.005-1.06; p=0.02) and PVD (OR 3.08 95% CI 1.17-8.06; p=0.02) were independently associated to AAC. Conclusions: We conclude that AAC is related to atherosclerosis and to renal failure-related CV risk factors. A careful evaluation of a frequently performed investigation is useful in CV disease risk stratification in HD patients.

N2  - Background. The Treat-to-Goal Study found that sevelamer slowed the progression of coronary calcification in patients on hemodialysis compared to calcium-based phosphate binders. To understand the implications of this effect for cardiovascular events, risk equations are needed. Methods. Data on 179 patients on hemodialysis treated at one center in France included biochemical values during the year prior to study entry, patient characteristics, and cardiovascular events over an average of 4 years. As arterial calcification was evaluated ultrasonographically and quantified using a 0 to 4 score, an equation relating this to the electron-beam tomography (EBT)-based calcification score used in the trial was developed and applied to all patients. The estimated scores were then used in survival and Cox proportional hazards analyses of cardiovascular events in relation to the degree of calcification, controlling for other characteristics. Results. Mean age at inclusion was 54 years, dialysis vintage 70 months, average follow-up 49 months; 32% suffered an event. The calcification score, diabetes, C-reactive protein (CRP), diastolic blood pressure, gender, smoking and hypertension are independent predictors of cardiovascular risk. The resulting equation indicates that, relative to a calcification score below 400, the risk of an initial event increases 44% for a score of 600, and more than doubles for a score of 1000. Conclusion. In the absence of long-term follow-up studies, these equations permit quantification of the expected long-term clinical consequences of the impact of various phosphate binders on vascular calcification. Together with resource use and cost information, these equations are key inputs for formal cost-effectiveness analyses. © 2005 by the International Society of Nephrology.

N2  - Background: Serum phosphorus (P) and the product of serum calcium × serum P (Ca × P), are frequently elevated in end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Elevated P and Ca × P have been associated with vascular calcification in dialysis patients. Objective: To examine the role of P and Ca × P as risk factors for incident peripheral vascular disease (PVD) in HD patients with pre-existing CVD. Methods: This nested case-control study is drawn from the 11 incident PVD events reported in the cohort of the Secondary prevention with antioxidants of cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease (SPACE): a randomized placebo-controlled trial. PVD was defined clinically and confirmed ultrasonographically. Each individual with a PVD event was matched for SPACE treatment group (vitamin E or placebo), age (in 4-year categories) and gender with two individuals who had no CVD end point during the follow-up period. Results: Serum P and Ca × P levels were significantly higher in PVD patients than in controls. In univariate logistic regression analysis, only serum P predicted PVD in this population (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.07-3.81, p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, adjustment was made for variables dissimilar by PVD status including underlying renal disease, diabetes, smoking, history of angina pectoris, prescription for vitamin D3, erythropoietin, calcium channel blockers and aspirin. In this model, serum P remained the only significant predictor of incident PVD (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.01-5.74, p=0.04). Conclusions: Findings of the present study are consistent with a role for serum P and Ca × P in the pathogenesis of PVD in HD patients. ©2005 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPTH) is highly prevalent among persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). SHPTH has been linked to uremic bone disease, vascular calcification, and a higher risk of death. Parathyroidectomy (PTX) can dramatically reduce parathyroid hormone (PTH) and phosphate levels; however, the relationship between PTX and survival is not known. METHODS: We conducted an observational matched cohort study utilizing data from the United States Renal Database System (USRDS) in which 4558 patients undergoing a first PTX while on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis were individually matched by age, race, gender, cause of ESRD, dialysis duration, prior transplantation status, and dialysis modality to 4558 control patients who did not undergo PTX. Patients were followed from the date of PTX until they died or were lost to follow-up. RESULTS: The 30-day postoperative mortality rate following PTX was 3.1%. Long-term relative risks of death among patients undergoing PTX were estimated to be 10% to 15% lower than those of matched control patients not undergoing surgery. Survival curves between the 2 groups crossed 587 days following PTX. Median survival was 53.4 months (95% CI: 51.2-56.4) in the PTX group, and 46.8 months (95% CI: 44.7-48.9) in the control group. CONCLUSION: PTX was associated with higher short-term, and lower long-term, mortality rates among U.S. patients receiving chronic dialysis. Measures to attenuate SHPTH may play an important role in reducing mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of mortality among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with arterial disease and left ventricular hypertrophy being the two principal factors of the high mortality rate in this population. In addition to traditional risk factors (age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, lifestyle, hyperlipidemia, smoking, hyperhomocystinemia), inflammation, oxidative stress and disorders of mineral metabolism may contribute to cardiovascular risk in patients with uremic syndrome. High serum phosphate may influence vascular calcifications directly and indirectly, by worsening secondary hyperparathyroidism. Several treatment options are available for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with ESRD. The treatment approach includes a diet low in phosphorus, with less than 1 g/kg/day of protein. Vitamin D supplementation is an important part of treatment. Phosphate binding agents are in most of the patients necessary in addition to diet. Aluminum hydroxide has been widely used for many years. It is very potent, but also very toxic, with severe encephalopathy as the most dangerous side effect. Calcium salts are less potent, and were considered safe for use In patients on dialysis. However, improvement in the understanding of vascular calcifications has demonstrated that calcium overload significantly contributes to widespread atherosclerosis in patients with ESRD. Sevelamer-hydrochloride is a novel non-aluminum, non-calcium containing phosphate binder, which is capable of reducing the levels of phosphorus as well as of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

N2  - Background. Arterial calcification is a common problem in patients with chronic kidney disease, and has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The goal of the present study was to evaluate whether pelvic artery calcifications are associated with technical failure of arteriovenous thigh grafts in haemodialysis patients. Methods. From 1 January 1999 to 30 June 2002, thigh grafts were placed in 54 haemodialysis patients who had exhausted all options for permanent vascular access in the upper extremities. Perioperative computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained in 32 of the patients for diagnostic purposes unrelated to vascular access planning. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the graft outcomes, scored the vascular calcifications on CT of the distal aorta, common iliac, external iliac and common femoral arteries on a semi-quantitative 5-point scale. The association between technical graft failure (inability to complete the anastomosis) and the vascular calcification score was analysed. Results. There was a high inter-observer agreement in scoring vascular calcification (κ=0.801). Among 26 patients with absent or mild pelvic arterial calcifications (grade 1-2) on CT, none (0%) experienced technical graft failure. In contrast, three of six patients (50%) with moderate to severe calcification (grade 3-5) had technical graft failures (P=0.004 by Fisher's exact test). The cumulative 1 year graft patency was lower in the group with grade 3-5 calcification (33 vs 81%, P=0.09). The two groups were similar in age, gender, race, diabetes, duration of dialysis, serum calcium, serum phosphorus and serum parathyroid hormone. Conclusion. There is a strong association between pelvic artery calcifications and technical failure of thigh grafts. The presence of moderate to severe vascular calcification is predictive of poor cumulative 1 year graft patency. © ERA-EDTA 2004; all rights reserved.

N2  - Background. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are highly prevalent in haemodialysis (HD) patients and have been recently associated with vascular calcifications. The objective of our study was to assess the value of a simple vascular calcification score for the prediction of cardiovascular death, cardiovascular hospitalizations and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in HD patients, and to correlate this score with cardiovascular disease and with other known predictors of vascular disease. Methods. In this observational, prospective study 123 chronic HD patients (75 males and 48 females; 20% diabetic) were included, who were on low-flux HD treatment for 46.6 ± 52 months (mean ± SD). We set up a simple vascular calcification score based on plain radiographic films of pelvis and hands. Brachial pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured and cardiovascular events and hospitalization episodes were assessed. Results. During an observational period of 37 months there were 17 cardiovascular deaths; 28 patients needed cardiovascular hospitalizations and 32 patients suffered fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events. Coronary artery disease was diagnosed in 43 patients (35%), peripheral arterial disease in 33 patients (26.8%), cerebrovascular disease in 16 patients (13%) and vascular disease (coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial disease or cerebral vascular disease) in 61 patients (49.6%). By binary logistic regression, diabetes (P = 0.01), male sex (P < 0.001), age (P = 0.02), HD duration (P = 0.02) and MAP (P = 0.03) were independently associated with a vascular score ≥3. This score ≥3 was independently associated with coronary artery disease (P = 0.008), peripheral arterial disease (P < 0.001) and vascular disease (P = 0.001). Patients with a vascular calcification score ≥3 had a 3.9-fold higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.03), a 2.8-fold higher risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations (P = 0.02) and a 2.3-fold higher risk of fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events (P = 0.04). Conclusions. The present vascular calcification scoring represents a simple tool for the assessment of cardiovascular risk related with vascular calcifications in chronic HD patients. © ERA-EDTA 2004; all rights reserved.

N2  - This case report details the unique breast calcification and swellings of a 61-year-old lady. The ectopic breast calcification was a result of chronic renal failure and hyperparathyroidism secondary to vesiculo-ureteric reflux nephropathy. Subcutaneous nodules were also noted around her ileostomy (from surgery due to Crohns disease) and abdominal wall. Mammogram revealed calcified breast discs and lobules with extensive vascular calcification. Histological biopsies revealed extensive calcium deposition (benign). Cutaneous deposition of calcium oxalate has been described in 13 patients world wide, usually involving fingers, ears, or nose. Two of these report breast involvement, but this is described as less extensive and more focal calcification on clinical findings and mammography. This case report describes a rare condition with extraordinary mammographic images. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background. Individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have highly prevalent and severe vascular and valvular calcification. We undertook this study to test the hypothesis that vascular and valvular calcification begins and is often severe long before diabetic renal disease progresses to ESRD. Methods. A total of 32 nondialyzed individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic renal disease (albumin excretion rate ≥30 μg/min) [mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 49.8 ± 6.1 mL/min/1.73 m2] were identified and compared with a group of 18 normoalbuminuric diabetics. We used 3:1 matching to identify 95 nondiabetic controls without renal disease, matched for age, gender, ethnicity, and the presence/absence of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and known coronary artery disease (CAD). Results. Using electron beam computed tomography (CT), the prevalence of coronary artery calcification was significantly greater among diabetic renal disease individuals (prevalence, 94% vs. 59%, P < 0.001; median score, 238 vs. 10, P < 0.001) than the nondiabetic controls. The coronary artery calcification scores were significantly more severe among diabetic renal disease individuals than either the diabetic or nondiabetic controls. Among individuals with diabetic renal disease, the coronary artery calcification and aortic wall calcification scores were several-fold greater among those with known CAD than among those without. There was also a significantly greater prevalence of aortic and mitral valve calcification among diabetic renal disease individuals than nondiabetic controls (aortic, 23% vs. 6%, P = 0.03; mitral, 25% vs. 2%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis using all three groups reproduced these findings and also consistently identified age and diabetic renal disease as additional predictors for the presence or severity of coronary artery and aortic wall calcification. Conclusion. In this first, systematic analysis among nondialyzed individuals with diabetic renal disease, these data demonstrate that vascular and valvular calcification is present and often severe long before the disease progresses to ESRD. The data also suggest that the coronary artery and aortic wall calcification may represent atherosclerosis.

N2  - Aim/hypothesis. Although derangements of calcium and phosphate control have been emphasized as important risk factors for vascular calcification in non-diabetic haemodialysis patients, similar risk factors for diabetic haemodialysis patients are not known. We compared factors affecting peripheral vascular calcification between haemodialysis patients with and without diabetes. Methods. We examined 421 patients on maintenance haemodialysis. There were 89 patients with Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (53 men and 36 women, 62±10 years old) and 332 patients without diabetes (192 men and 140 women, 59±13 years old). Hand roentgenography was carried out, and visible vascular calcification of the hand arteries was evaluated. Results. There were 42 diabetic patients and 45 non-diabetic patients with vascular calcification. The prevalence of vascular calcification in diabetic patients (47.1%) was higher than in non-diabetic patients (13.6%) (p<0.001). In multivariate logistic regression, the main factors affecting vascular calcification in non-diabetic patients were advanced age, longer duration of haemodialysis, increased phosphate concentrations, male gender, and lower predialysis diastolic pressure. In diabetic patients, predictors for vascular calcification were higher values of HbA1C and longer duration of haemodialysis. In diabetic patients, a 1% increase in HbA1C increased the risk of calcification by 2.1-fold (95% CI 1.282-3.575, p=0.0029). Conclusion/interpretation. We have shown that poor glycaemic control, rather than calcium and phosphate concentrations, is a predictor of peripheral vascular calcification in diabetic patients on haemodialysis. This study emphasizes that glycaemic control remains critical even in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease.

N2  - Our EBT study of 205 adult hemodialysis patients revealed a high prevalence of calcification of the coronary arteries, aorta, and cardiac valves. Notably, the degree of coronary calcification was far greater than expected for age- and gender-matched normal individuals in the general population. In addition, the severity of vascular calcification was related to highly prevalent cardiovascular disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that abnormal regulation of mineral metabolism in ESRD increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients. To better understand the mechanisms involved and the link between calcification and cardiovascular disease, prospective trials and observational studies aimed at investigating the effects of modifying the course of calcification will be necessary. Therapeutic interventions such as the use of calcium-free phosphate binders, ACE inhibitors,2 and statins may reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease in ESRD patients. Non-invasive tools such as EBT can be useful to monitor the effectiveness of these measures by following the progression of coronary calcification in patients at risk.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine clinical and laboratory correlates of calcification of the coronary arteries, aorta and mitral and aortic valves in adult subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. BACKGROUND: Vascular calcification is known to be a risk factor for ischemic heart disease in non-uremic individuals. Patients with ESRD experience accelerated vascular calcification, due at least in part to dysregulation of mineral metabolism. Clinical correlates of the extent of calcification in ESRD have not been identified. Moreover, the clinical relevance of calcification as measured by electron-beam tomography (EBT) has not been determined in the ESRD population. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 205 maintenance hemodialysis patients who received baseline EBT for evaluation of vascular and valvular calcification. We compared subjects with and without clinical evidence of atherosderotic vascular disease and determined correlates of the extent of vascular and valvular calcification using multivariable linear regression and proportional odds logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The median coronary artery calcium score was 595 (interquartile range, 76 to 1,600), values consistent with a high risk of obstructive coronary, artery disease in the general population. The coronary artery calcium scores were directly related to the prevalence of myocardial infarction (p < 0.0001) and angina (p < 0.0001), and the aortic calcium scores were directly related to the prevalence of claudication (p = 0.001) and aortic aneurysm (p = 0.02). The extent of coronary calcification was more pronounced with older age, male gender, white race, diabetes, longer dialysis vintage and higher serum concentrations of calcium and phosphorus. Total cholesterol (and high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein subfractions), triglycerides, hemoglobin and albumin were not significantly related to the extent of coronary artery calcification. Only dialysis vintage was significantly associated with the prevalence of valvular calcification. CONCLUSIONS: Coronary artery, calcification is common, severe and significantly associated with ischemic cardiovascular disease in adult ESRD patients. The dysregulation of mineral metabolism in ESRD may influence vascular calcification risk. © 2002 by the American College of Cardiology.

N2  - Background. Cardiac valve calcification (VC) has been detected with increased frequency in haemodialysis (HD) patients, making it necessary to determine the potential pathogenic factors in uraemic patients. Methods. A total of 92 chronic HD patients (39 female, 53 male) and 92 age and gender-matched nondialysis control subjects were evaluated by echocardiography and a severity score for VC was determined. Calcium-phosphate metabolism was evaluated at the beginning of haemodialysis. Results. We found a greater prevalence of VC in dialysis patients than in normal patients (mitral annulus 44.5% vs 10%, P = 0.02; aortic annulus 52% vs 4.3%, P = 0.01). HD patients with mitral calcification were found to be older than patients without calcification, were on long-term renal replacement therapy, had longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension, had greater values of the highest value of mean calcium-phosphate product in 6 successive months (CaxP) and the highest absolute value of calcium-phosphate product (CaxP(max)). We also found a positive correlation between calcification score, age, and CaxP. No correlation was found between actual VC and arterial hypertension or parathyroid hormone. Multiple stepwise regression analysis selected age and CaxP as the most predictive parameters for mitral calcification (r = 0.47). Mitral calcification was associated more frequently with rhythm and cardiac conduction defects, valvular insufficiency and with peripheral vascular calcification. Aortic calcification was correlated with age (r = 0.42) and longer duration of predialysis arterial hypertension. Conclusion. Our study confirmed an increased prevalence of VC in HD patients and selected age and calcium-phosphate product as the most predictive parameters. These findings support careful monitoring of calcium metabolism beginning at the early stages of end-stage renal failure to reduce the risk of heart disease.
